0.455,"You are an astronaut exploring a newly discovered planet Y. Planet Y has a mass that is 4.32 times the mass of Earth and a radius that is 0.70 times the radius of Earth.

If your mass is 78.1 kg, determine:
1. The formula for the gravitational force acting on you on Earth.
2. The gravitational force acting on you on planet Y.
3. How the gravitational force on planet Y compares to that on Earth.","### Step 1: Gravitational force on Earth
The gravitational force experienced by an object of mass $m$ on Earth is given by

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Earth}} m}{R_{\text{Earth}}^2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{(6.67430 \times 10^{-11})(5.972 \times 10^{24})(78.1)}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2}
\]

This gives:
\[
F_{\text{Earth}} \approx 767.24\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 2: Gravitational force on planet Y
The same formula applies, but with the planet's mass and radius:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Y}} m}{R_{\text{Y}}^2}
\]

where:
- $M_{\text{Y}} = 4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}$
- $R_{\text{Y}} = 0.70 R_{\text{Earth}}$

Substituting:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G (4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}) m}{(0.70 R_{\text{Earth}})^2}
\]

Numerically, this yields:
\[
F_{\text{Y}} \approx 6792.57\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Comparison of forces
The ratio of the gravitational force on planet Y to that on Earth is:

\[
\frac{F_{\text{Y}}}{F_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{4.32}{(0.70)^2}

r₁ = R + h₁ = 4525 + 19845 = 24370 km
r₂ = R + h₂ = 4525 + 37689 = 42214 km

### Step 2: Circular orbit velocities
The circular velocity is given by:
v = √(μ / r)

v₁ = √(3.15e+04 / 24370) = 1.137 km/s
v₂ = √(3.15e+04 / 42214) = 0.864 km/s

### Step 3: Transfer orbit parameters
The semi-major axis of the Hohmann transfer orbit is:
aₜ = (r₁ + r₂)/2 = 33292 km

The eccentricity is:
e = (r₂ − r₁)/(r₂ + r₁) = 0.2680

### Step 4: Velocities on the transfer orbit
Using the vis-viva equation:
v = √[ μ ( 2/r − 1/a ) ]

Velocity at periapsis (r₁): vₚ = 1.280 km/s
Velocity at apoapsis (r₂): vₐ = 0.739 km/s

### Step 5: Velocity increments
ΔV₁ = vₚ − v₁ = 0.143 km/s
ΔV₂ = v₂ − vₐ = 0.125 km/s

### Step 6: Transfer time
The transfer time is half the period of the elliptical orbit:
t = π √(aₜ³ / μ)

t = 107503 s ≈ 29.86 hours

### Bonus Explanation
At very large orbital altitudes, the circular orbital velocity approaches the escape velocity of the planet. Any additional ΔV required to circularize the orbit may exceed the escape velocity, causing the spacecraft to leave the planet’s gravitational influence rather than remain in a bound orbit.","ΔV₁ = 0.143 km/s, ΔV₂ = 0.125 km/s

- Semimajor axis of the target planet's orbit: 5.02 AU

    v² = GM☉ ( 2/r − 1/a )

For a Hohmann transfer from Earth to the target planet, the perihelion distance is Earth's orbital radius and the aphelion distance is the target planet’s orbital radius. The semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse is therefore:

    a = (r_E + r_P)/2 = (1.00 AU + 5.02 AU)/2

At the distance of the target planet, r = r_P, the spacecraft’s heliocentric speed is:

    v_sc = [ GM☉ ( 2/r_P − 1/a ) ]^{1/2}

  • Transfer semi-major axis: a = 2.249 AU

Assume the departure point is at periapsis of the transfer ellipse (one-tangent condition).
Use μ☉ = 1.32712440018×10¹¹ km³/s² and 1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km.

How do you convert the time-of-flight from seconds to days? Provide the time-of-flight in days.","Step 1: Convert the given distances from AU to km.
  1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km
  r₁ = (0.997)(AU) = 149,203,746.608 km
  r₂ = (1.880)(AU) = 281,309,553.784 km
  a  = (2.249)(AU) = 336,402,162.599 km

Step 2: Apply the one-tangent condition (departure at periapsis).
  For an ellipse, periapsis radius is:
    r_p = a(1 - e)
  With r_p = r₁, solve for eccentricity e:
    e = 1 - r₁/a
    e = 1 - (149,203,746.608)/(336,402,162.599) = 0.556472

Step 3: Compute the semi-latus rectum p.
  For an ellipse:
    p = a(1 - e²)
    p = (336,402,162.599)(1 - 0.556472²) = 232,231,467.979 km

Step 4: Solve for the arrival true anomaly ν₂ using the conic equation.
  Radius as a function of true anomaly is:
    r(ν) = p / (1 + e cos ν)
  Set r(ν₂) = r₂ and solve for cos ν₂:
    r₂ = p / (1 + e cos ν₂)
    1 + e cos ν₂ = p / r₂
    cos ν₂ = (p/r₂ - 1)/e
    cos ν₂ = (232,231,467.979/281,309,553.784 - 1)/0.556472 = -0.313516
  Therefore:
    ν₂ = arccos(-0.313516) = 1.889690 rad = 108.271°
  With departure at periapsis (ν₁ = 0), the change in true anomaly is:

  Rearranged:
    tan(E/2) = sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) · tan(ν/2)
    sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) = sqrt((1-0.556472)/(1+0.556472)) = 0.533814
    tan(E/2) = (0.533814)·tan(1.889690/2) = 0.738401
    E = 2·atan(tan(E/2)) = 2·atan(0.738401) = 1.272073 rad

    M = E - e sin E
    M = 1.272073 - (0.556472)·sin(1.272073) = 0.740245 rad

  Compute mean motion n for the ellipse:
    n = sqrt(μ / a³)

- Final orbit radius: r₂ = 234800 km
- Transfer apogee radius: r_b = 809115 km
- Gravitational parameter: μ = 398600.5 km³/s²

### Step 2: Compute the semi-major axes of the two transfer ellipses
For a bi-elliptical transfer:
- First transfer ellipse:
  \[

  \[
  a_{t1} = \frac{9615 + 809115}{2} = 409365.0 \text{ km}

Step 1: Relate the measured orbit to the relative two-body orbit.
For two identical masses $M$ orbiting the center of mass with radius $R$, the separation between the stars is

Substitute $M_1+M_2=2M$ and $a=2R$:

What is his longitude? (The equation of time, in the convention solar time minus mean time, is 2 minutes on the summer solstice and 2 minutes on the autumnal equinox)","Step 1: Relate local solar time (LST) and local mean time (LMT) using the equation of time.

$\mathrm{EoT}=\mathrm{LST}-\mathrm{LMT}$

On the autumnal equinox, the equation of time is:

$\mathrm{EoT}=2\ \mathrm{min}$

At sunrise on an equinox, local solar time is:

$\mathrm{LST}=6^{\mathrm{h}}$

So the local mean time at sunrise is:

Observing the CCD of the telescope, Evan notices that the star has a diameter D = 0.949 µm. Furthermore, he measures its apparent magnitude to be m = 7.24. What is the approximate temperature of this star? Please, neglect the atmospheric seeing in your calculations.","Step 1: Use parallax to find the distance.
With p in arcseconds, d(pc) = 1/p.
p = 93 mas = 0.093 arcsec
d = 1/0.093 = 10.8 pc
Convert to meters: d = (10.8)(3.086×10^16 m) = 3.318e+17 m

Step 2: Convert the CCD spot size into an angular radius (small-angle approximation).
A linear radius x on the focal plane corresponds to angle θ ≈ x/f.
f = 688 mm = 6.881e-01 m
D = 0.949 µm = 9.487e-07 m, so x = D/2 = 4.743e-07 m
θ = x/f = (4.743e-07)/(6.881e-01) = 6.893e-07 rad
Then the stellar radius is R = θ d:
R = (6.893e-07)(3.318e+17) = 2.287e+11 m

Step 3: Compute the Sun’s apparent magnitude from the distance modulus at 1 AU.
m_⊙ − M_⊙ = 5 log10(a_pc) − 5, where a_pc is 1 AU in parsecs.
a_pc = AU/pc = (1.496e+11)/(3.086e+16) = 4.848e-06 pc
m_⊙ = M_⊙ + 5 log10(a_pc) − 5 = 4.83 + 5 log10(4.848e-06) − 5 = -26.74

Step 4: Use Pogson’s relation to get the flux ratio:
m − m_⊙ = −2.5 log10(F/F_⊙)  ⇒  F/F_⊙ = 10^{0.4(m_⊙ − m)}
F/F_⊙ = 10^[0.4(-26.74 − 7.24)] = 2.557e-14

Assuming uniform angular motion, how long will it take until the two planets again share the same ecliptic longitude?","Step 1: Geometry of the orbit
For a planet with orbital inclination i and angular velocity ω, the relation between its ecliptic longitude λ and time t is obtained from spherical geometry:

    tan λ = cos i · tan(ω t)

Step 2: Condition for equal ecliptic longitude
The planets share the same ecliptic longitude again when:

    cos i₁ · tan(ω₁ t) = cos i₂ · tan(ω₂ t)

Step 3: Use the ratio of angular velocities
Since ω = 2π / T, the angular velocities satisfy:

    ω₂ / ω₁ = T₁ / T₂ = 2.00

For the present case, this leads to an algebraic equation for tan(ω₁ t).
Following the standard textbook manipulation:

Step1: Use the Rayleigh criterion to calculate the best-case resolution

$$
\theta_m = \frac{1.22\lambda}{D},
$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the primary mirror.

With $\lambda = 478\,\text{nm} = 4.784e-07\,\text{m}$ and $D=43.4\,\text{m}$:

These particles are in an orbit of 1.81AU around the Sun. Assuming the radii of these particles are around 0cm and their albedo is 0.38, estimate the density of these particles. Express your answer in particles per square arcsecond.","'''
Step1: We can find the total luminosity from one square arcsecond of this source by using

$$
M-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
\quad\text{and}\quad
m-M=5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right).

Combine these to eliminate $M$:

$$
2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
= M_\odot + 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right) - m
\implies
L=L_\odot\left(\frac{r}{10\:\mathrm{pc}}\right)^2\cdot 10^{(M_\odot-m)/2.5}.
$$

At the antisolar point (directly opposite the Sun), the dust is approximately $r=|R-1|$ AU from Earth, so

Step2: Now, let's calculate how much luminosity one particle reflects. To do this, we calculate the solar flux at the dust orbit
and multiply by the particle's cross-sectional area and its albedo.

The solar flux at heliocentric distance $R$ is

$$
F = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}.
$$

A particle of radius $a$ has cross-section $A=\pi a^2$, so the reflected power (in this simplified model) is

$$
L_p = F\,A\,\alpha = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}\cdot (\pi a^2)\cdot \alpha.

With $R=1.81\,\text{AU}$, $a=0\,\text{cm}$, and $\alpha=0.38$:

Get:

$$
L_p \approx 4.98\times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}.

Step3: Finally, divide the total luminosity per arcsec$^2$ by the reflected luminosity per particle:

$$
N = \frac{L}{L_p}

Step 2: Determine the true angular diameter of the cluster using the small-angle approximation:

How long does the satellite take to hit the surface of the planet?","Step 1: Conceptual approach
The satellite initially moves in a circular orbit. When its velocity is reduced to zero, it begins to fall radially toward the planet. Because the initial orbital radius is much larger than the planet’s physical radius, the time to reach the surface is approximately the same as the time to reach the planet’s center.

This motion can be modeled as a degenerate elliptical orbit with:
  • Semi-major axis a = r / 2
  • The planet located at one focus

The satellite reaches the planet after half of the orbital period.

Step 2: Apply Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s Third Law for an orbit is:
    T² / a³ = 4π² / (GM)

Since the fall time t corresponds to half the orbital period:
    T = 2t

Substitute a = r / 2 and T = 2t:

During what percentage of the time period of each orbit is the planet at least $0.687328902145742 r_{\text{min}}$ away from the star?","Step 1:
For an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$, the minimum and maximum distances from the focus are
$$r_{\text{min}} = a(1-e), \quad r_{\text{max}} = a(1+e).$$
Thus,
$$\frac{1+e}{1-e} = 4.164559619010866 \implies e = \frac{4.164559619010866-1}{4.164559619010866+1} = 0.613.$$

Step 2:
From $r_{\text{min}} = a(1-e)$, we obtain
$$a = \frac{1}{1-e} r_{\text{min}} = 2.582 \, r_{\text{min}}.$$
In the standard geometric construction of an ellipse, the semi-minor axis intersects the orbit at points that are a distance $a$ from the focus. This divides the orbit into regions of smaller and larger radial distance.

Step 3:
By Kepler’s second law, the fraction of time spent in a given part of the orbit is equal to the fraction of the total area swept out. Using the standard area decomposition (half the ellipse plus a triangular region), the proportion of the orbital period corresponding to this region is

Step 3: Use conservation of momentum about the center of mass.
For two bodies orbiting their common center of mass:
M_s v_s = m_p v_p

For an edge-on orbit, the measured RV semi-amplitude equals the star’s orbital speed:
v_s = K = 67.16 m/s

Thus,
m_p = M_s (v_s / v_p)
    = (2.504e+30 kg) × (67.16 m/s) / (1.546e+05 m/s)

Calculate the total mass of the stars, using the fact that their maximum angular separation measured from Earth is θ = 5.63 mas and they are on an edge-on orbit.","Step 1: From the definition of parallax, the distance d to the system (in parsecs) is:
d = 1 / p(arcsec)

Convert p from mas to arcsec:
p = 6.27 mas = 0.00627 arcsec

Thus,
d = 1 / 0.00627 = 159.5665 pc

Step 2: The projected physical separation at maximum angular separation is:
a = d·θ

Convert θ from mas to arcsec:
θ = 5.63 mas = 0.00563 arcsec

Since 1 arcsec at d(pc) corresponds to d AU:
a = (159.5665)·(0.00563) AU
  = 0.89830 AU

Step 3: Because the orbit is edge-on, the projected separation equals the true separation:
a = 0.89830 AU

At the tube intersection, y = 0.0 m, so:
0.0 = x^2 / 25 + (-2.3)

Solve for x^2:
x^2 / 25 = 0.0 - (-2.3) = 2.3
x^2 = 25 · (2.3) = 57.262

Thus, the mirror edge is at:
x = ±sqrt(57.262) = ±7.567 m

So the mirror diameter is:

Step 2: Identify the focal length from the parabola coefficient.
A standard axial parabola with focal length f has the form:
y = x^2 / (4f) + c

Comparing with y = x^2 / 25 + c, we match:

What is the minimal possible ratio of the semi-major axis of planet A to that of planet B?","Step 1: To minimize the ratio of semi-major axes, the orbits must be at the limit of touching each other. If they were separated by a larger gap, the larger orbit could be shrunk further, reducing the ratio.

Because the major axes are aligned, there are two limiting configurations to consider.

Step 2: First configuration — the apoapsis of the smaller orbit touches the periapsis of the larger orbit.

Using the expressions for periapsis and apoapsis:
    r_peri = a(1 - e),   r_apo = a(1 + e)

This gives:
    a_A(1 - e_A) = a_B(1 + e_B)

Therefore:
    a_A / a_B = (1 + e_B) / (1 - e_A)
    = 2.164

Step 3: Second configuration — the apoapsis of the smaller orbit touches the apoapsis of the larger orbit.

Therefore:

The center of mass divides the separation inversely in the ratio of the masses.

Distance of Ek from the center of mass:
r_Ek = (m_Do / (m_Ek + m_Do)) × separation
     = (1.3 / (5.8 + 1.3)) × 7.9

Step 2: Relate the orbital velocities.
Both asteroids have the same angular velocity about the center of mass.
Thus, orbital speed is proportional to distance from the center of mass.

Let the orbital speed of Ek be v.

If the cluster has physical radius R_C and is at distance d, its angular diameter is approximately

For a circular aperture, the Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolution:

where λ is the observing wavelength and D is the aperture diameter.

Step 3: Relate the aperture diameter to the focal ratio.
The aperture diameter is given by

D = f / (f-ratio)

Assume an average human produces 113 W of power and has a volume of 61266 cm$^3$.","Step 1: Compute the power per unit volume produced by a human.

The volume of the human must first be converted to cubic meters:

$$V = 61266 \times 10^{-6} = 6.1266e-02\,\mathrm{m^3}.$$

The power per unit volume is then

$$u = \frac{113}{6.1266e-02} = 1839\,\mathrm{W/m^3}.$$

Step 2: Compute the total power output of the Sun at this power density.

The volume of the Sun is $\frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3$, so the total power is

$$P = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3 u.$$

a_t = (a_E + a_M)/2
a_t = ( 1.469e+08 + 2.297e+08 )/2 = 1.883e+08 km

Step 2: The heliocentric speed on the transfer orbit at Earth's distance (vis-viva equation) is

Determine the distance to Star A.","Step 1: A parsec is defined as the distance at which an object produces a parallax of 1 arcsecond when observed from a baseline of 1 AU.
The parallax angle is half of the total angular variation over one year:

p = 623.5 / 2 = 311.75 mas

Converting milliarcseconds to arcseconds:

0.525,"Using Kepler’s laws of planetary motion to calculate the orbital period of a comet: the comet’s perihelion distance is 1.0 AU and its aphelion distance is 50,000 AU. After passing near the Sun, non-gravitational forces changed its orbital period from 6,000 years to 3,000 years. By how much did the comet’s semi-major axis change?","Step 1: The semi-major axis of the original orbit is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances:

    a₁ = (q + Q) / 2 = (1.0 + 50,000) / 2

    a₁ = 25,000.50 AU

Step 2: According to Kepler’s third law, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

    a₁³ / T₁² = a₂³ / T₂²

Step 3: Solving for the new semi-major axis a₂:

    a₂ = a₁ · (T₂ / T₁)^(2/3)

Step 4: Substituting the given values:

    a₂ = 25,000.50 · (3,000 / 6,000)^(2/3)

    a₂ ≈ 15,749 AU

0.525,A spaceship lands on an asteroid with a diameter of 8.32 km and an average density of 2.82 g/cm^3. The asteroid is slowly rotating. The astronauts decide to walk along the asteroid’s equator and complete one full circle in 1.21 hours. Is this feasible?,"Step 1: Compute the asteroid’s mass.
Approximate the asteroid as a uniform sphere:
M = (4/3)πr^3 ρ
Diameter = 8.32 km = 8.323e+03 m, so r = 4.162e+03 m
ρ = 2.82 g/cm^3 = 2.819e+03 kg/m^3
M = (4/3)π(4.162e+03)^3(2.819e+03) = 8.511e+14 kg

Step 2: Find the speed needed to stay gravitationally bound near the surface.
Using the vis-viva equation for a circular orbit (a = r):
v^2 = μ(2/r − 1/a) with μ = GM  ⇒  for a = r:  v = sqrt(GM/r)
v = sqrt((6.67430e-11)(8.511e+14)/(4.162e+03)) = 3.695 m/s

Step 3: Compute the walking speed required to go once around the equator in time T.
Circumference = 2πr, and T = (hours)×3600 s:
T = 1.21×3600 = 4.372e+03 s
v' = 2πr/T = 2π(4.162e+03)/(4.372e+03) = 5.982 m/s

Step 4: Compare speeds.
If the required walking speed exceeds the near-surface orbital speed, the astronaut
cannot remain in contact with the surface while moving that fast.
Here, v' = 5.982 m/s and v = 3.695 m/s, so v' > v.

Find the comet's velocity at perihelion (Earth orbital speed v_e = 37 km/s).","Step 1: Because e is very close to 1, treat the orbit as near-parabolic.
For a parabolic orbit, perihelion speed is sqrt(2) times the circular speed at the same radius.

Circular speed scaling: v ∝ a^(-1/2).
v_circ = v_e * (a_c/a_e)^(-1/2) = 37 * (1.976)^(-1/2) km/s

Step 2: Parabolic perihelion speed:
v_p = sqrt(2) * v_circ ≈ 1.4142 * 26.31 km/s

Therefore, the comet's velocity at perihelion is approximately 37 km/s.",37 km/s,No,
0.455,A comet with an orbital period shorter than 250 years is defined as a short-period comet. Its perihelion distance is 0.874 AU. Find the possible maximum distance of its aphelion.,"Step 1: To get the maximum possible aphelion distance, take the largest allowed period.
So set the comet period T = 250 years, and perihelion distance q = 0.874 AU.

Using Kepler’s third law relative to Earth:
  (a / a_Earth)^3 = (T / T_Earth)^2.
With a_Earth = 1 AU and T_Earth = 1 year, this becomes:
  a^3 = T^2  =>  a = T^(2/3).

Thus the semi-major axis is:
  a = (250)^(2/3) AU ≈ 39.685 AU.

Step 2: For an elliptical orbit, perihelion q and aphelion Q satisfy:
  q + Q = 2a.
So the aphelion distance is:
  Q = 2a − q = 2×39.685 − 0.874 AU ≈ 78.496 AU.

Therefore, the maximum possible aphelion distance is about 78.5 AU.",[Answer] 78.5 AU,No,
0.455,The thermonuclear reactions of the Sun cause a decrease in the Sun’s mass. Please calculate the increase in the Earth's orbital radius over 227 years resulting from this mass loss. Assume that the Earth maintains a perfectly circular orbit during this process.,"Step 1: Use Einstein’s mass–energy relation to relate luminosity and mass loss.
L_sun = -dE/dt = -(dM/dt)c^2  =>  dM/dt = -L_sun / c^2.

Substitute the constants:
dM/dt = -(3.83e+26) / (3.00e+08)^2 kg/s
     ≈ -4.26e+09 kg/s.

Step 2: For a circular orbit, v^2 = GM/r. If the orbit remains circular and angular momentum
is conserved (l = mrv = constant), then r ∝ 1/M.
Therefore:
dr/dt = - r (dM/dt) / M.

dr/dt = -(1.496e+11) * (-4.26e+09) / (1.99e+30) m/s
     ≈ 3.20e-10 m/s.

Step 3: Over the time interval Δt, the increase in orbital radius is
Δr ≈ (dr/dt)Δt.
Here Δt = 227 years = 7.159e+09 s.

Δr ≈ (3.20e-10) * (7.159e+09) m
   ≈ 2.29 m.

Therefore, the Earth's orbital radius increases by about 2.29 m in 227 years.",2.29m,No,

  F = σ T^4.
Therefore, the ratio of fluxes from two regions depends only on the fourth power of their temperatures:
  F1/F2 = (T1^4) / (T2^4) = (T1/T2)^4.

Substitute T1 = 5222 K and T2 = 6000 K:
  F1/F2 = (5222/6000)^4

0.455,"The visual binary star consists of two components, one with a magnitude of 0.35^m and the other with a magnitude of 1.67^m. What is the magnitude of this binary system?","Step 1: Magnitudes cannot be added directly; add fluxes first.
Let the fluxes be F1 and F2. The magnitude–flux relation gives:
m1 − m2 = −2.5 log10(F1/F2)
(0.35 − 1.67) = −2.5 log10(F1/F2)

Solve for the flux ratio:
F1/F2 = 10^{(m2−m1)/2.5}
F1/F2 = 10^((1.67−0.35)/2.5) = 3.38

Step 2: Add the fluxes to get the total flux F0:
F0 = F1 + F2
Write F2 in terms of F1:
F2 = F1 · 10^{-(m2−m1)/2.5}
F0 = F1[1 + 10^(-(1.67−0.35)/2.5)] = F1(1.2958)

Step 3:
Substituting $r_1 / r_2 = 434$,

Today, the CMB has a temperature of approximately T_today = 2.94 K.
At what redshift z would the CMB spectrum have a peak at an infrared wavelength of λ = 0.175 mm?

Assume the CMB follows Wien's displacement law and that cosmological redshift stretches wavelengths linearly.","Step 1: Determine the present-day peak wavelength of the CMB.
Using Wien's displacement law:

    λ_today · T_today = b

where b ≈ 2.90 mm·K.

Thus,
    λ_today = b / T_today = 2.90 / 2.94 ≈ 0.987 mm

Estimate the diameter of a telescope needed to obtain a spectrum of the same quality with the same instrument and exposure time for this star at its normal apparent brightness.","Step 1: Determine the microlensing magnification.
Let F be the unmagnified flux of the star. During microlensing, the flux is increased by a factor A. The relation between magnitude and flux is:

    m1 − m2 = −2.5 log10(F1 / F2)

Applying this to the unlensed and lensed magnitudes:

    I − I' = −2.5 log10(F / (A F)) = 2.5 log10 A

Thus:

    A = 10^((19.8 − 16.4) / 2.5) ≈ 23

Step 2: Relate flux collection to telescope diameter.
The number of photons collected per unit time is proportional to the collecting area, and hence to the square of the mirror diameter. Let D be the required telescope diameter.

To collect the same number of photons from the unlensed star as the reference telescope does from the lensed star:

    F D^2 = A F D_ref^2

The masses of the moon and the primary asteroid are m = 7.69e+09 kg and M = 7.29e+11 kg, respectively. The spacecraft’s impact speed relative to the moon was 6.32 km/s.

Assuming the collision is central and perfectly inelastic, and neglecting external gravitational influences, calculate the expected change in the orbital period of the moon (in minutes).","Step 1: Determine the initial orbital radius and velocity.
Because the primary asteroid is much more massive than the moon, we treat the moon as orbiting a fixed central mass. From Kepler’s third law:

    a^3 / P^2 = GM / (4π^2)

Solving for a gives a = 1.431e+03 m. The corresponding orbital speed is:

    v0 = 2πa / P

which yields v0 = 1.844e-01 m/s.

Step 2: Apply conservation of linear momentum during the collision.
For a perfectly inelastic, head-on collision:

    m v0 − m_s v_s = (m + m_s) v'

Since m_s << m, this can be approximated as:

    v' ≈ v0 − (m_s / m) v_s

Numerically, Δa / a = -4.604e-03.

Step 3: Relate the change in semi-major axis to the change in orbital period.
For Keplerian motion:

    ΔP / P = (3/2) (Δa / a)

In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability. In astronomy, the degradation of stellar image quality and resolution caused by atmospheric turbulence and scattering is called *seeing*, and the size of the seeing disk is used to evaluate the atmospheric optical quality at a telescope site.

Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

$\frac{a^3}{T^2} = M$

$a = \sqrt[3]{MT^2} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 5^2} \approx 3.684 \text{ AU}$

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

Get: 

$r=\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos f}$

$\cos f=\frac{1}{e}\left(\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{r}-1\right)$

$f_{3}\text{ AU }=99^{\circ}5^{\prime}27^{\prime\prime}$

$f_{4}\text{ AU }=231^{\circ}47^{\prime}36^{\prime\prime}$

Step3: From the true anomaly, we must convert it to eccentric anomaly. Similar to before, the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ and the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between 180° and 360°.

Get:

$\cos E = \frac{e + \cos f}{1 + e \cos f}$

$E_{3 \text{ AU}} = 68^\circ 12^{\prime} 7.2^{\prime\prime}$

$E_{4 \text{ AU}} = 260^\circ 7^{\prime} 18.9^{\prime\prime}$

Step4: From the eccentric anomaly, we must convert it to mean anomaly. Similar to before, the mean anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between 0 and $\pi$ and the mean anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between π and 2π. (The calculation below is in radians)

Get:

$M = E - e \sin E$

$M_{3 \text{ AU}} = 0.7261 \text{ rad}$

$M_{4 \text{ AU}} = 5.0326 \text{ rad}$

Step5: From the mean anomaly, we can find the elapsed time since March 14, 2025.

Get:

$M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \times (t - t_0)$

$\Delta M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$

$\Delta t = \Delta M \times \frac{T}{2\pi} = (M_{4 \text{ AU}} - M_{3 \text{ AU}}) \times \frac{5 \text{ yrs}}{2\pi}$

$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$

0.735,"Consider a hypothetical solar sail that starts its trajectory just outside the surface of the Sun and aims to reach Jupiter's orbit. This is a square sail with a size length of $l=50$ m, a mass of $m=2.0$ kg, and a reflectivity of $\eta=85\%.$ The remaining $15\%$ of the photons are absorbed by the sail. In order to simplify the calculations, only take into account the gravity and radiation pressure from the Sun, and assume that the sail is initially stationary with respect to the Sun. Estimate how long it would take for this sail to reach Jupiter's orbit. Feel free to make reasonable approximations if needed, but be sure to state and justify any approximations you make.","Step1: The radiation pressure is a result of the momentum of the photons, which is given by the following expression:

$p=\frac{E}{c}$

Where $p$ corresponds to the momentum, $E$ is the energy of the photon, and $c$ is the speed of light.

Since the momentum is conserved after the collision of the photons with the sail, it is possible to write the following expression for the radiation pressure on the sail.

Get:

$P_r=(1+\eta)\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}$

Where $P_r$ is the radiation pressure and $F_{\odot}$ is the Solar flux. Note that the $1+\eta$ term comes from the fact that a fraction $\eta$ of the photons being reflected causes a momentum in the opposite direction to their motion before the collision with the sail.

Step2: In order to preserve the momentum, the sail needs to end up with $1+\eta$ times the initial momentum to account for the reflected photons.

Taking into account both the radiation pressure and the gravity, it is possible to find an expression for the acceleration $a$ as a function of the distance $r$ to the Sun.

Get:

$ma=(1+\eta)A\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$ma=(1+\eta)l^{2}\frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^{2}c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$a=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{(1+\eta)l^{2}L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm}-GM_{\odot}\right)$

$k=\frac{(1+\eta)l^2L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm} - GM_{\odot}=\frac{(1+0.85)\cdot 50^2\cdot 3.827\cdot 10^{26}}{4\pi \cdot 2.998\cdot 10^8 \cdot 2.0}-6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\cdot 1.989\cdot 10^{30}=1.0\cdot 10^{20} m^3 s^{-2}$

Step3: Using the definition of acceleration and the chain rule

Get:

$a=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}t}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}\mathrm{d}r=v\mathrm{d}v$

Step4: Integrating to find the velocity of the sail.

Get:

$\int_{R_{\odot}}^{r}\frac{k}{u^2}\mathrm{d}u=\int_{0}^{v}v\mathrm{d}v$

$\frac{v^2}{2}=k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)$

$v=\sqrt{2k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)}$

Step5: Since the radius of Jupiter’s orbit is much larger than the the radius of the Sun, for most of the trajectory, the velocity of the sail is approximately the following:

$v\approx \sqrt{\frac{2k}{R_{\odot}}}=5.4\cdot 10^5\ \mathrm{m/s}$

This is because the term $\frac{1}{r}$ is negligible compared to $\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}$ for most of the trajectory. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the time to travel to Jupiter as follows.

Get: 

$\Delta t\approx\frac{a_{4}}{v}=\frac{5.2\cdot 1.496\cdot 10^{11}}{5.4\cdot 10^5}=1.4\cdot 10^6\ \mathrm{s}=16\ \mathrm{days}$

$R_i = 8.3 \times 10^{17} \text{ m} = 26.9 \text{ pc}$

Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$.

1.092,"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star. This wind-fed accretion is especially significant in systems that include an early-type star (such as an O or B star, indicated henceforth as an OB star), alongside a compact object like a neutron star (NS) in a close orbit. Consider such a NS-OB star binary system where a neutron star of mass $M_{\mathrm{NS}}=2.0\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and radius $R_\mathrm{NS}=11$ km is orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $a$ around the centre of the OB star with velocity $v_\mathrm{orb}=1.5\times10^{5}ms^{-1}$ (<image>JSTL-Fig-11</image>as shown in the figure). Throughout this problem the mass loss from the OB star is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its rate is $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{OB}}=1.0\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.

The accretion radius, $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the maximum distance from the NS at which the stellar wind can be captured by the NS. If the stellar wind speed at the orbital distance of the NS is $v_\mathrm{w}=3.0\times10^6m s^{-1}$, find $R_\mathrm{acc}$ for the above system in km using standard escape velocity calculations.","Step1: The accretion radius can be estimated by equating the gravitational potential energy of the stellar wind to its kinetic energy

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{w}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = \frac{G M_{\mathrm{NS}} \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\mathrm{acc}}}\Longrightarrow \quad R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}}$

where, $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the wind density and $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity of the wind.

Get:

For the case considered above $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} + v_{\mathrm{orb}}^{2}$

To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

where $r\in(R_{\mathrm{SC}},\infty)$ is the radial coordinate, $\phi\in[0,2\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle, and $E$ and $L$ are constants related to the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum, respectively. Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem. Another useful equation is obtained by differentiating the first equation: $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

Circular light trajectories can exist around the black hole. Find the radius, $r_{\rm ph}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\rm ph}$, for such photon trajectories in terms of $M$ and relevant constants.","Step1: Circular trajectories have $r = \mathrm{constant}$. Hence, the radial velocity $v_r = 0$ and rate of change of radial component of velocity $\frac{dv_r}{dt} = 0$. From the third equation, $\frac{dv_r}{dt} - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0,$

1.092,"An astrophysical survey mapped all the galaxies in a small region of the sky, of angular diameter $\Delta\theta=0.01$ rad, where many galaxies seemed to be concentrated around the central area of the image. When the positions and redshifts of all the galaxies in this cluster were measured, an interesting distribution emerged. As shown in the figure. <image>JSTL-Fig-13</image>

Using these observations, estimate the total mass of the galaxy cluster and express your answer in solar masses. Assume that this galaxy cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, with a root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_{z}=\sqrt{\langle(z-0.7)^{2}\rangle}=0.0005$. Feel free to make reasonable approximations when considering the average velocities, masses, and spatial distribution of the galaxies. Consider that the distance to $\bar{z}=0.7$ in the standard cosmological model is $D_{A}=1500$ Mpc. Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion. Notice, however, that only the dispersion in redshift is given, which translates into a radial velocity dispersion: $\sigma_{v_{r}}=c\cdot\sigma_{z}=2.998\times10^{8}\:\mathrm{m/s}\times0.0005=1.499\times10^{5}\:\mathrm{m/s}$

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

Get:

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

And, assuming the cluster is spherical, its radius is: $R=\frac{D_A\cdot\Delta\theta}{2}=\frac{1500\times10^6\times206265\times1.496\times10^{11}\times10^{-2}}{2}=2.3143\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{m}$

Due to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, Jupiter is slightly flattened at its poles. The equation of a spheroid approximating for the shape of Jupiter can be stated as:$\begin{aligned}\frac{x^2+y^2}{R_e^2}+\frac{z^2}{R_p^2}=1,\end{aligned}$

where $R_{e}=7.15\times10^{7}$ m is the equatorial radius of Jupiter, and $R_{p}=6.69\times10^{7}$ m the polar radius. The radii of curvature of this spheroid in any direction can be calculated by the following equations $(\epsilon={\frac{R_{e}}{R_{p}}})$: 

$r(\phi)=R_{e}\left(1+\epsilon^{-2}\tan^{2}\phi\right)^{-1/2}$

$R(\phi)=R_{e}\epsilon^{-2}\left(\frac{r(\phi)}{R_{e}\cos\phi}\right)^{3}$

What is the bias of the sampled halo field? Derive an equation to evaluate the bias which depends on the bare bias and the variance in each pixel.","Step1:
**Detailed Steps**.

The solution to this question involves some domain knowledge, parts of which were given in the problem's statement, some approximations sourced by the domain knowledge, and some mathematical calculations. The domain knowledge is very basic and should be known to anyone in the field. Approximations are intuitive and also, mostly, inspired by the domain knowledge. Following Polya, we can organize it as follows:

Step2:
**Understand the problem.**

The number density of halos $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:

$\begin{equation}N_h = \int_{V} n_h(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}.\end{equation}$


The overdensity is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{n_h(\mathbf{x})-\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}{\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}.\end{equation}$

Linear bias is defined in terms of Fourier-transformed quantities:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{k}) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k}).\end{equation}$

This is an approximation that holds on sufficiently large scales (small $k$). $\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$ and $\delta_h(\mathbf{k})$ are Gaussian random fields with zero mean and their variance depends only on the magnitude of the wave-vector $k=|\mathbf{k}|$:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{mm}(k)),\ \delta_h \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{hh}(k)).\end{equation}$

The quantity $P(k)$ is called the power spectrum and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{k})\delta(\mathbf{k'})\rangle = (2\pi)^3\delta^D(\mathbf{k+k'})P(k).\end{equation}$

It immediately follows that:

$\begin{equation}P_{hh}(k) = b^2P_{mm}(k).\end{equation}$

We are given the expression in real space. In real space, the quantity $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$ is also a Gaussian random field:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_m),\ \delta_h(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_h).\end{equation}$

Quantity $\xi$ is called a two-point (real-space) correlation function and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x'})\rangle = \xi(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|).\end{equation}$

This quantity is sufficiently small when $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|\gg1$. We are asked to find what is the expression for $b$ in the equation $\delta_h(k) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$, given the real-space expression for the number density $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of real-space sample of $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$.

Step3:
**Devise a plan.**

The key point to solve this problem should be that real-space correlation function for halos $\xi_h$ should also be equal to $b^2\xi_m$. We want to calculate that correlation function. It should be expressed in terms of $\langle n(\mathbf{x})\rangle$ and $\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})n_h(\mathbf{x'})\rangle$. We expect to be able to calculate these expectations since they are the expectations of functions of the Gaussian random variables. We are given the pixel variance $\sigma$. How does it connect to the other quantities we know? In principle, that's also the part of domain knowledge but it also can be deducted from the definitions already given. A discretized version of the correlation function is:

$\begin{equation}\xi_{ij} = \langle\delta_{\mathbf{x_i}}\delta_{\mathbf{x_j}}\rangle.\end{equation}$

When $i=j$, it becomes the pixel variance $\sigma$. \textit{Aside, we could have given instead of $\sigma$, the quantity $P_{mm}(k)$, that is a common description of a cosmological dark-matter field. In that case, from the definitions of $\xi(r)$ and $P_{mm}(k)$, we could have deduced that $\sigma = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{k}P_{mm}(k)$}. Then we pick the ensemble of all the pixels at given fixed large distance $r=|\mathbf{x_i}-\mathbf{x_j}|$. The key is to recognize that it is fully described by a correlated bivariate Gaussian distribution.

$\begin{equation}(\delta^m_{i},\delta^m_{j}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma) \end{equation}$

with a covariance

$\begin{equation}\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2 & \xi^m_r  \\ \xi^m_r & \sigma^2 \end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}$

In general, the integrals from the expectation values are cumbersome, but we should expect some simplifications from the fact that $\xi$ is small and we can Taylor-expand the pdf.

Step4:
**Carry out the plan.**

It's more convenient to define $\hat{\delta}_{i} = \delta^m_i/\sigma$ and $\hat{\xi} = \xi^m_r/\sigma^2$, and $\phi_2$ - a correlated bivariate Gaussian pdf - then

$\begin{equation}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2(1-\hat{\xi}^2)}[\hat{\delta}^2_{i}+\hat{\delta}^2_{j}-2\hat{\xi}\hat{\delta}_{i}\hat{\delta}_{j}]}}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\hat{\xi}^2}} \equiv \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}).\end{equation}$

We note that

$\begin{equation}\xi^{n}_r = \frac{\langle n_in_j\rangle}{\langle n \rangle^2}-1.\end{equation}$

The quantity $\langle n\rangle$ is the actual mean number density:

$\begin{equation}\bar{n}^{'} = \langle n \rangle = \langle n_i \rangle = \int n^{loc}(\delta_i,b,\bar{n}) \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}) d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j} = \int n^{loc}_i \phi_1(\hat{\delta_i})d\hat{\delta_i}.\end{equation}$

Here, $\phi_1$ - is a standard normal pdf. It is expected that it's not dependent on the correlation $\hat{\xi}$, but only on $b$ and $\sigma$, just as the marginal of 2D correlated Gaussian distribution is 1D Gaussian that's not dependent on the cross-correlation. To the linear order in $\hat{\xi}$,

$\begin{equation}\phi_2(x,y|\hat{\xi}) \approx \phi_1(x)\phi_1(y)(1+\hat{\xi}xy).\end{equation}$

So that the two-point function neatly factorizes:

$$\begin{aligned}&\langle n_{i}n_{j}\rangle=\int n^{loc}(\delta_{i},b,\bar{n})n^{loc}(\delta_{j},b,\bar{n})\phi_{2}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi})d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\approx\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})d\hat{\delta}_{j}+\hat{\xi}\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})\hat{\delta}_{j}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\equiv\langle n\rangle^{2}+\hat{\xi}\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^{2}.\end{aligned}$$


Substituting the results for $\langle n\rangle$ and $\langle n_in_j\rangle$ in  the equation for $\xi^n_r$, we can read off the bias:

$\begin{equation}b^{'2} = \frac{\xi^n_r}{\sigma^2\hat{\xi}} = \frac{\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^2}{\sigma^2\langle n\rangle^2}.\end{equation}$


All that is left is to calculate the expectations. One can evaluate for $b\geq0$


$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta_{i}})d\hat{\delta_{i}}=\int\bar{n}\max(0,1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\int_{-\frac{1}{b\sigma}}^{+\infty}(1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)+b\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

For $b<0$ it's, however, 

$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\bar{n}\int_{-\infty}^{+\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}}(1-|b|\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

So we conclude that the latter expression is valid for all $b$. Similarly, one can show that

$\begin{equation}\langle n\hat{\delta }\rangle = \bar{n}\int\max(0,1+b\sigma x)x\phi_1(x)dx = \bar{n}b\sigma \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\end{equation}$

where $\Phi_1(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x\phi_1(x)dx$ - normal cdf. Finally, one can get

$\begin{equation}\boxed{b^{'} = \frac{b \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}{\Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}}.\end{equation}$

Note: We also accept solutions as correct if they omit the $|~|$ around the bias, since halo bias is usually positive.

 & =\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step9: where we used the completeness of the basis, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:x1}) and (\ref{eq:x2}), and the usual delta function normalization of the position basis. This and a similar relation for $\hat{y}_{2}$ imply

$\begin{equation}
\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}=\left|\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}$

Step10: This means

$\begin{equation}
\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\right)=\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\rangle=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].
\end{equation}$

Step11: The partial trace is defined through the following contraction of $(2,2)$ tensor to a $(1,1)$ tensor: 

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw\left(|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}''|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle w|\right)\left(|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\right)\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\right)\\
 & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step12: Integrate over $w$, we find

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\exp\left[-\frac{m}{4}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[\frac{(\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}-\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}})^{2}(x_{1}'+x_{1}'')^{2}}{8\frac{1}{m}(\frac{1}{\omega_{1}}+\frac{1}{\omega_{2}})}\right]\\

\end{align*}

Step13: Next, to identify the matrix, use

$\begin{equation}
\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}2x_{1}'x_{1}''-m\left[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}\right]\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}=-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left[\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)-2\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right]
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\gamma\equiv8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\equiv\frac{m\gamma}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
b=2\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}
\end{equation}$

Step14: to write

\begin{align}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}} \times \nonumber\\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\exp\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right).
\end{align}

Step15: Change basis to energy with a new effective frequency

$\begin{equation}
b_{3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{3}}}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}=\sum_{nv}|v\rangle\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle\langle n|
\end{equation}$

\begin{align}
\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\langle v|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\

\end{align}

Step16: where

$\begin{equation}
\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!b_{3}\sqrt{\pi}2^{n}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{3}^{2}}}H_{n}\left(\frac{x_{1}'}{b_{3}}\right)
\end{equation}$

are the well known oscillator wave functions and $b_{3}$ still has to be chosen. One can show by carrying out the integrals that the
matrix is diagonalized if 

\begin{align*}
b_{3} & =\frac{b}{\left(1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}\omega_{1}^{1/4}\omega_{2}^{1/4}}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step17: This gives $\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle=\lambda_{n}\delta_{vn}$ where

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}m_{11}\left(\frac{b^{2}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}}{1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}}}\right)^{n-1}\\

\end{align*}

Step18: where we used

\begin{align*}
m_{11} & =\frac{b^{3}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\sqrt{2\pi}}{\left(1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right)^{2}}\right)^{3/2}}\\
 & =\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}\sqrt{2\pi}}{4(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})\left(\frac{1}{b^{2}}+\frac{1}{b_{3}^{2}}\right)^{3/2}}\numberthis
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{b_{3}}{b}\right)^{2} & =\frac{1}{m\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{1}{4\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step19: Simplify:

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+4\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}\right)^{n}\\
 & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{n}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step20: Since we want to evaluate

$\begin{equation}
-\mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}\right]=-\partial_{n}\ln\mathrm{tr}\hat{\rho}^{n}|_{n=1}
\end{equation}$

Step21: we compute

\begin{align*}
\ln\mathrm{tr}\rho^{n} & =\ln\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}^{n}\right)\\
 & =\ln\left(\sum_{j}\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{j}\right]^{n}\right)\\

\end{align*}

Step22: Hence, we arrive at

\begin{align*}
S & =-\left\{ \ln\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right]-\frac{\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]\ln\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]}{\left(1-\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]\right)}\right\} \\

0.952,"For the action

$\begin{equation}
S = \int dt a^3(t) \left\{ \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 - V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] \right\}
\end{equation}$

where \( q \) and \(V_0\) are constants, derive and solve (integrate) the equation of motion for the field $\phi$ assuming slow-roll inflation and initial condition $\phi(t=0) = \phi_0$.","Step1: The equation of motion is

$\begin{equation}
\ddot{\phi} + 3 H \dot{\phi} - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{1}{M_P} \right) V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] = 0.
\end{equation}$

Step2: For the slow-roll inflation, the following must hold: 

$\begin{equation}
    \ddot{\phi}\ll 3H\dot{\phi} \,.
\end{equation}$

Step3: Hence, we have

$\begin{equation}
3 H \dot{\phi} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{1}{M_P} \right) V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right].
\end{equation}$

Step4: Slow-roll approximation also implies 

$\begin{equation}
H^2\approx\frac{V(\phi)}{3M^2_P}
\end{equation}$

Step5: so we need to solve the following ODE:

$\begin{equation}
3 \sqrt{\frac{V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right]}{3 M_P^2}} \frac{d\phi}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{1}{M_P} \right) V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right]

$\begin{equation}
\int \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{V_0}} \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3q}} t \,.

Step6: Performing the integration and solving for $\phi(t)$ we get

$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{V_0}} M_P \sqrt{2q} \left( \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] - \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi_0}{M_P} \right) \right] \right) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3q}} t

along with $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ where $\eta$ is a spacetime-independent infinitesimal fermionic parameter inducing the transformation. Find the transformation rule $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ for the action associated with $\mathcal{L}$ to remain invariant.","Denoting the variation $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ as $\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}$, we write

 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi

again denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms, and we are using the standard notation $\eta\xi\equiv\eta^{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\equiv\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}$.
