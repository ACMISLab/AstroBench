"The angular resolution of the human eye is 14/0.6 = 23”, while that of a 2.16-meter telescope is 14/216 = 0.06”. Based on these data, the human eye can distinguish details separated by 10 cm at a distance of 0.9 km, whereas the 2.16-meter telescope can extend this capability to more than 300 km. However, this is an ideal situation considering only the diffraction limit. In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability. In astronomy, the degradation of stellar image quality and resolution caused by atmospheric turbulence and scattering is called *seeing*, and the size of the seeing disk is used to evaluate the atmospheric optical quality at a telescope site. Even at observatory sites with excellent seeing, the seeing disk can still reach about 1”. In modern cities, sky light pollution is severe: not only is the resolution extremely poor, but even the basic “ability to see” is greatly diminished. People who have never left large cities have never seen the magnificent sight of a star-studded sky, nor have they appreciated the beauty of the bright Milky Way. Lacking direct experience inevitably weakens one’s affection for nature and spirit of exploration. <image>JSTL-Fig-1</image> As shown in the figure, some computed data under the assumption of exceptionally good atmospheric conditions are listed. Now, based on the limiting magnitude *m*, where a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, calculate the distance *r* at which a “single candle flame” can be seen. ","Step 1: The limiting magnitude is the magnitude of the faintest celestial object that can be seen. Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

Get: 

$r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}}}$ meters  
$= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54}} \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers  
$= 0.6275 \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers.

Here *m* is the limiting magnitude. For the human eye, *m = 6.5*, so $r = 0.6275 \times 10^{1.3}$ kilometers $= 12.5$ kilometers.

Final_answer: $\boxed{r = 12.5 km}$  ",r = 12.5 km,Yes,JSTL-Fig-1,0.63
"<image>JSTL-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, David is researching an Earth-like exoplanet near the constellation of Bootes, orbiting a star twice the mass of our Sun. On March 14, 2025, the planet was observed at 3 AU from its parent star. After some time, David observes it again and finds that it has already passed its farthest point from the star and is now at 4 AU. If the planet is known to have a period of 5 years and an eccentricity of 0.5, what is the shortest amount of time that could have passed since the first observation on March 14, 2025? Assume that David views the orbit face-on and that the exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points.","Step1: First, we need to find the planet’s semi-major axis through the Kepler’s third law.

Get:

$\frac{a^3}{T^2} = M$

$a = \sqrt[3]{MT^2} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 5^2} \approx 3.684 \text{ AU}$

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

Get: 

$r=\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos f}$

$\cos f=\frac{1}{e}\left(\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{r}-1\right)$

$f_{3}\text{ AU }=99^{\circ}5^{\prime}27^{\prime\prime}$

$f_{4}\text{ AU }=231^{\circ}47^{\prime}36^{\prime\prime}$

Step3: From the true anomaly, we must convert it to eccentric anomaly. Similar to before, the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ and the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between 180° and 360°.

Get:

$\cos E = \frac{e + \cos f}{1 + e \cos f}$

$E_{3 \text{ AU}} = 68^\circ 12^{\prime} 7.2^{\prime\prime}$

$E_{4 \text{ AU}} = 260^\circ 7^{\prime} 18.9^{\prime\prime}$

Step4: From the eccentric anomaly, we must convert it to mean anomaly. Similar to before, the mean anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between 0 and $\pi$ and the mean anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between π and 2π. (The calculation below is in radians)

Get:

$M = E - e \sin E$

$M_{3 \text{ AU}} = 0.7261 \text{ rad}$

$M_{4 \text{ AU}} = 5.0326 \text{ rad}$

Step5: From the mean anomaly, we can find the elapsed time since March 14, 2025.

Get:

$M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \times (t - t_0)$

$\Delta M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$

$\Delta t = \Delta M \times \frac{T}{2\pi} = (M_{4 \text{ AU}} - M_{3 \text{ AU}}) \times \frac{5 \text{ yrs}}{2\pi}$

$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$

"<image>JSTL-Fig-3</image>It may be useful to know the semi-latus rectum of an ellipse is the distance between one of its foci and the point on the ellipse immediately above or below it, as shown in the diagram below. Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$. We now rearrange for $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\ell}{a}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\ell}{a}$. Plugging in $\frac{\ell}{a} = 0.01$

Assume that the Earth is perfectly spherical.","Step1: If we project it to Earth, point A would be the North Pole, point B would be Boston, and point C would be Mumbai. From this, we can infer that side a is the geodesic distance. With the cosine formula:

$\cos a = \cos b \cos c + \sin b \sin c \cos A = \cos(90 - \phi_{Boston}) \cos(90 - \phi_{Mumbai}) + \sin(90 - \phi_{Boston}) \sin(90 - \phi_{Mumbai}) \cos(\lambda_{Boston} - \lambda_{Mumbai})$

Get:

$a \approx 110°8'20'' \approx 1.9223 \text{ rad}$

Step2: Now, convert the geodesic distance from angle to length unit

Get:

"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

$V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})}+V_{\mathrm{s}}$

where, $\gamma=2\times10^{-8}\text{ km}^{-1}$, $V_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the constant speed of the solar wind, $R_{0}$ and $V_{0}$ are the distance and velocity, respectively, at time $t_{0}$, and $S$ is the sign factor. $S=1$ if $V_{0}>V_{\mathrm{s}}$; $S=-1$ if $V_{0}\leq V_{\mathrm{s}}$.

<image>JSTL-Fig-9</image>As shown in the figure show the observed radial distance from the surface of the Sun, $R_\mathrm{obs}(t)$ (measured in R$_\odot)$, as a function of time, $t$ (in hours), for two CMEs: CME-3 and CME-4. The last data point in each table (D5 and P8, respectively) corresponds to the arrival time of the respective CME at Earth. For this part, assume $V_{\mathrm{s} }= 330$ km $s^{- 1}$.

We shall evaluate if the “drag-only” model satisfactorily predicts the arrival times of these CMEs. To use this model an appropriate choice of $t_0$, and corresponding $R_0$ and $V_{0}$ needs to be made.

For CME-3, take the following two cases:

(C1) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D1-D2 .

(C2) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D3-D4.

Assume the velocity remains constant in each specific interval D1-D2 and D3-D4, but may differ between the two intervals. Using $t_{0},R_{0}$, and $V_{0}$, calculate the difference between the observed and the predicted radial distance, $\delta R_{\mathrm{D}}\equiv R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)-R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$ in units of R$_\odot$ at $t=58.05h$,  for each of the two cases.","Step1: Inserting, $R_{0}$, $t_{0}$, $V_{0}$, and $V_{s}$ in the given expression

"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star. This wind-fed accretion is especially significant in systems that include an early-type star (such as an O or B star, indicated henceforth as an OB star), alongside a compact object like a neutron star (NS) in a close orbit. Consider such a NS-OB star binary system where a neutron star of mass $M_{\mathrm{NS}}=2.0\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and radius $R_\mathrm{NS}=11$ km is orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $a$ around the centre of the OB star with velocity $v_\mathrm{orb}=1.5\times10^{5}ms^{-1}$ (<image>JSTL-Fig-11</image>as shown in the figure). Throughout this problem the mass loss from the OB star is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its rate is $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{OB}}=1.0\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.

The accretion radius, $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the maximum distance from the NS at which the stellar wind can be captured by the NS. If the stellar wind speed at the orbital distance of the NS is $v_\mathrm{w}=3.0\times10^6m s^{-1}$, find $R_\mathrm{acc}$ for the above system in km using standard escape velocity calculations.","Step1: The accretion radius can be estimated by equating the gravitational potential energy of the stellar wind to its kinetic energy

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{w}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = \frac{G M_{\mathrm{NS}} \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\mathrm{acc}}}\Longrightarrow \quad R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}}$

where, $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the wind density and $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity of the wind.

Get:

For the case considered above $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} + v_{\mathrm{orb}}^{2}$

"<image>JSTL-Fig-12</image>As shown in the figure, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has released an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87 galaxy. To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

where $r\in(R_{\mathrm{SC}},\infty)$ is the radial coordinate, $\phi\in[0,2\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle, and $E$ and $L$ are constants related to the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum, respectively. Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem. Another useful equation is obtained by differentiating the first equation: $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

Circular light trajectories can exist around the black hole. Find the radius, $r_{\rm ph}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\rm ph}$, for such photon trajectories in terms of $M$ and relevant constants.","Step1: Circular trajectories have $r = \mathrm{constant}$. Hence, the radial velocity $v_r = 0$ and rate of change of radial component of velocity $\frac{dv_r}{dt} = 0$. From the third equation, $\frac{dv_r}{dt} - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0,$

Get:

we get radius $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$ of circular orbits to be $r_{\mathrm{ph}} = 3GM/c^2$

"An astrophysical survey mapped all the galaxies in a small region of the sky, of angular diameter $\Delta\theta=0.01$ rad, where many galaxies seemed to be concentrated around the central area of the image. When the positions and redshifts of all the galaxies in this cluster were measured, an interesting distribution emerged. As shown in the figure. <image>JSTL-Fig-13</image>

Using these observations, estimate the total mass of the galaxy cluster and express your answer in solar masses. Assume that this galaxy cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, with a root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_{z}=\sqrt{\langle(z-0.7)^{2}\rangle}=0.0005$. Feel free to make reasonable approximations when considering the average velocities, masses, and spatial distribution of the galaxies. Consider that the distance to $\bar{z}=0.7$ in the standard cosmological model is $D_{A}=1500$ Mpc. Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion. Notice, however, that only the dispersion in redshift is given, which translates into a radial velocity dispersion: $\sigma_{v_{r}}=c\cdot\sigma_{z}=2.998\times10^{8}\:\mathrm{m/s}\times0.0005=1.499\times10^{5}\:\mathrm{m/s}$

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

Get:

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

And, assuming the cluster is spherical, its radius is: $R=\frac{D_A\cdot\Delta\theta}{2}=\frac{1500\times10^6\times206265\times1.496\times10^{11}\times10^{-2}}{2}=2.3143\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{m}$

Now, using the virial theorem, it is possible to calculate the total mass:

Get:

$- \frac { 3 } { 5 } G M _ { T } ^ { 2 } \frac { 1 } { R } + 2 \cdot \frac { 3 } { 2 } M _ { T } \sigma _ { v _ { r } } ^ { 2 } = 0$

$\Rightarrow M _ { T } = \frac { 5 R \sigma _ { v _ { r } } ^ { 2 } } { G }= \frac { 5 \times 2 . 3 1 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 3 } \times ( 1 . 4 9 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } ) ^ { 2 } } { 6 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 } } \mathrm { k g }\approx 3 . 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 4 } \mathrm { k g } = 2 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 4 } \mathrm { M } _ { \odot }$

"Observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background favour a flat (Euclidean) geometry, in which the total mass density (i.e.  density of matter and equivalent mass density of all forms of energy) should be equal to the so-called critical density: $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}\:=\:\frac{3\:H_{0}^{2}}{8\:\pi\:G}$,

where $H_{0}$ is the present value of the Hubble constant. However, the total density of matter (luminous and dark) is estimated at $\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}\:\approx\:2.8\cdot10^{-27}\:\mathrm{kg}\:\mathrm{m}^{-3}\:.$

To resolve this discrepancy, the standard cosmological model assumes that the Universe is filled with a mysterious ‘dark energy’ of constant energy density $E_\Lambda.$ Determine the value of $E_\Lambda$ and calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy. Neglect the contribution of electromagnetic radiation. Constant table as shown in the figure.<image>JSTL-Fig-14</image>","Step1: Substituting the values of $H_{0}$ and $G$ from the table of constants,  

Get:

$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}=9.202 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

Step2: In flat geometry we have: $\rho_{m, 0}+\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{c^{2}}=\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$

Hence $E_{\Lambda}$ is given by: $E_{\Lambda}=\left[\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}-\rho_{m, 0}\right] c^{2} \approx 5.756 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

The linear scale of the Universe, $a$, is related to the cosmological redshift: $a(z)=a_{0} /(1+z)$

Get:

Thus, the matter density, $\rho_{m}$, increases with redshift: $\rho_{m}(z)=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3}$

Step3: We substitute the matter density, $\rho_{m}$ by the energy density, $E_{m}$, using the relationship $E=m c^{2}$

$E_{m}(z)=\rho_{m}(z) c^{2}=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3} c^{2}$

Get:

We finally get $z_{\mathrm{eq}}=\left[\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{\rho_{m, 0} c^{2}}\right]^{1 / 3}-1 \approx 0.32$

"Almost half of the stars that we see are either binary or multiple star systems. A well-known example of this is Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), which was initially thought to be a single star, but today recognised as a binary system comprising two stars that we will refer to as Menkalinan A and B.

"In the following problem the fluid mechanics of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS) is studied based on the velocity field data.<image>JSTL-Fig-18</image>As shown in the figure shows a map of relative velocity for GRS and the surrounding region. The arrows are oriented and scaled as per the directions and magnitudes of winds at different points.

Due to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, Jupiter is slightly flattened at its poles. The equation of a spheroid approximating for the shape of Jupiter can be stated as:$\begin{aligned}\frac{x^2+y^2}{R_e^2}+\frac{z^2}{R_p^2}=1,\end{aligned}$

where $R_{e}=7.15\times10^{7}$ m is the equatorial radius of Jupiter, and $R_{p}=6.69\times10^{7}$ m the polar radius. The radii of curvature of this spheroid in any direction can be calculated by the following equations $(\epsilon={\frac{R_{e}}{R_{p}}})$: 

$r(\phi)=R_{e}\left(1+\epsilon^{-2}\tan^{2}\phi\right)^{-1/2}$
