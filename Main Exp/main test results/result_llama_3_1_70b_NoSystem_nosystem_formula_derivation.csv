2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"## Step 1: Understand the virial theorem's objective and its components.
The virial theorem aims to relate the average kinetic energy of a system to its average potential energy, based on the sum of the inner products of position vectors and forces acting on the system's constituents. The theorem initially applies to thermodynamic systems but can be extended to gravitational systems like galaxies. We need to derive the formula using Newton's second law, which relates the force acting on a mass to its resulting acceleration.

## Step 2: Recall Newton's second law of motion.
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is represented as $F = ma$, where $F$ is the net force applied to the object, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $a$ is the acceleration produced.

## Step 3: Express the force in terms of the second derivative of the position vector.
Since acceleration $a$ is the second derivative of the position vector $r$ with respect to time ($a = \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$), we can substitute this into Newton's second law to express the force in terms of the position vector: $F = m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$.

## Step 4: Formulate the inner product $r \cdot F$ using the expression for $F$ from step 3.
The inner product $r \cdot F$ can now be written as $r \cdot m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$. This simplifies to $m(r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2})$.

## Step 5: Sum the inner products over all molecules in the system to get the virial.
Summing $m(r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2})$ over all molecules gives us $\sum m(r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2})$. This represents the total virial of the system.

## Step 6: Derive the formula of the virial theorem by considering the time average of the total virial.
To derive the virial theorem, we take the time average of the total virial. This involves integrating $\sum m(r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2})$ over time and then dividing by the time interval. After performing this operation and simplifying, we get the formula for the virial theorem: $\langle \sum m(r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}) \rangle = \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\langle \sum \frac{1}{2}mr^2 \rangle = 2\langle T \rangle - \langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle$, where $\langle T \rangle$ is the average kinetic energy of the system, and $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle$ relates to the average potential energy.

## Step 7: Relate the derived formula to the potential energy for gravitational systems.
For gravitational systems, the force $F$ is derived from the gravitational potential energy. By relating $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle$ to the potential energy, we can express the virial theorem in terms of average kinetic and potential energies. For a stable, gravitationally bound system, the theorem simplifies to $2\langle T \rangle = -\langle U \rangle$, where $\langle U \rangle$ is the average potential energy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2\langle T \rangle = -\langle U \rangle}$",0.546

The problem asks us to derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the given dynamical equation for each body. The dynamical equation describes the motion of each body in the system, taking into account the gravitational interactions with all other bodies. Our goal is to identify the quantities that remain constant over time, which are the first integrals of motion.

## Step 2: Recognize the type of system and relevant conserved quantities
The given equation is a second-order differential equation describing the motion of N bodies under mutual gravitational attraction. For such a system, we expect to find conserved quantities related to energy, momentum, and angular momentum. These are typical first integrals of motion for systems with translational and rotational symmetries.

## Step 3: Derive the conserved quantities
To derive the conserved quantities, we will use the given dynamical equation and apply mathematical operations to identify the quantities that remain constant over time.

### Step 3.1: Total Linear Momentum
Sum the dynamical equations over all bodies to obtain the equation for the total linear momentum:
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$.
Notice that the double sum is antisymmetric in $i$ and $j$, so it vanishes. This implies that the total linear momentum $\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ is conserved.

### Step 3.2: Total Angular Momentum
To derive the conserved quantity related to angular momentum, we take the cross product of each dynamical equation with the position vector $\mathbf{r}_i$ and sum over all bodies. This will yield an equation for the total angular momentum $\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$, which is also conserved due to the antisymmetric nature of the gravitational interactions.

### Step 3.3: Total Energy
Finally, to derive the conserved quantity related to energy, we take the dot product of each dynamical equation with the velocity vector $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$ and sum over all bodies. After some algebraic manipulations, we obtain an equation that represents the conservation of total energy $E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.

To prove the given velocities at aphelion (vA) and perihelion (vP) for a celestial body in elliptical motion, we should recall the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, particularly Kepler's laws and Newton's law of universal gravitation. The goal is to derive expressions for vA and vP in terms of the standard gravitational parameter (μ), the semi-major axis (a), and the eccentricity (e) of the orbit.

## Step 2: Recall relevant orbital mechanics formulas
First, recall that the standard gravitational parameter μ is given by μ = G \* M, where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the central body. For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis a is a key parameter that determines the size of the orbit.

## Step 3: Apply the Vis-Viva equation
The Vis-Viva equation relates the velocity (v) of an object in an elliptical orbit to its distance (r) from the central body, the semi-major axis (a), and the eccentricity (e). The Vis-Viva equation is:
v^2 = μ * (2/r - 1/a)

## Step 4: Determine radius at aphelion and perihelion
At aphelion (the farthest point), the radius r = a * (1 + e), and at perihelion (the closest point), the radius r = a * (1 - e).

## Step 5: Substitute radii into the Vis-Viva equation for aphelion and perihelion
Substituting the radius at aphelion into the Vis-Viva equation:
vA^2 = μ * (2/(a * (1 + e)) - 1/a)

Substituting the radius at perihelion into the Vis-Viva equation:
vP^2 = μ * (2/(a * (1 - e)) - 1/a)

## Step 6: Simplify the expressions for vA^2 and vP^2
For vA^2:
vA^2 = μ/a * (2/(1 + e) - 1)
vA^2 = μ/a * (2 - 1 - e)/(1 + e)
vA^2 = μ/a * (1 - e)/(1 + e)
vA^2 = μ/a * ((1 - e)/(1 + e))
vA = sqrt(μ/a) * sqrt((1 - e)/(1 + e))

For vP^2:
vP^2 = μ/a * (2/(1 - e) - 1)
vP^2 = μ/a * (2 - 1 + e)/(1 - e)
vP^2 = μ/a * (1 + e)/(1 - e)
vP^2 = μ/a * ((1 + e)/(1 - e))
vP = sqrt(μ/a) * sqrt((1 + e)/(1 - e))

## Step 7: Write the final expressions for vA and vP
Thus, the final expressions for the velocities at aphelion (vA) and perihelion (vP) are:
vA = sqrt(μ/a) * sqrt((1 - e)/(1 + e))
vP = sqrt(μ/a) * sqrt((1 + e)/(1 - e))

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify key parameters.
We are given a cylindrical planet with average density $\rho$ and radius $R$. A satellite orbits around this planet at a distance $d$ from its center. We need to find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$.

## Step 2: Recall the formula for gravitational force.
The gravitational force between two objects is given by $F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.

## Step 3: Determine the mass of the cylindrical planet.
The mass of the cylindrical planet can be calculated as the product of its density and volume. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi R^2 h$, where $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Assuming the height is very large compared to the radius (a very long cylinder), we can approximate the mass as $M = \rho V = \rho \pi R^2 h$.

## Step 4: Apply the formula for centripetal force to the satellite's orbit.
The centripetal force required for the satellite's orbit is provided by the gravitational force between the satellite and the planet. So, we can write $F_c = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{d} = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{d^2}$, where $m$ is the mass of the satellite and $v$ is its velocity.

## Step 5: Express the velocity of the satellite in terms of its period.
The velocity of the satellite can be expressed as $v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}$.

## Step 6: Substitute the expression for velocity into the centripetal force equation.
Substituting the expression for velocity into the centripetal force equation, we get $\frac{m \cdot (2\pi d/P)^2}{d} = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{d^2}$.

## Step 7: Simplify the equation and solve for period.
Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{4\pi^2 m d}{P^2} = \frac{G \cdot \rho \pi R^2 h \cdot m}{d^2}$. Canceling out the mass of the satellite and rearranging, we get $P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{G \cdot \rho \pi R^2 h}$.

## Step 8: Take the square root of both sides to solve for period.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $P = \frac{2\pi d^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G \cdot \rho \pi R^2 h}}$.

## Step 9: Simplify the expression by combining constants.
Combining the constants, we get $P = \frac{2\pi d^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G \rho \pi} R \sqrt{h}}$. Let's define a constant $k = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{G \rho \pi} \sqrt{h}}$. Then, $P = k \cdot \frac{d^{3/2}}{R}$.

However, I will ignore the last term with the square root of $h$ here since we must not include any factor which was not defined in the initial data, so we do need to leave it as it was before combining constants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2\pi d^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G \cdot \rho \pi R^2 h}}}$",0.637

We have two galaxies, A and B, both with radius R. Galaxy A is a spiral galaxy with a rotational velocity of v at a distance R from its center. Galaxy B is a spherical elliptical galaxy with a radial velocity dispersion of v. The radial velocity dispersion is a measure of the spread of velocities in the galaxy.

## Step 2: Calculate the mass of Galaxy A using the rotational velocity
The rotational velocity of a galaxy is related to its mass by the formula: v^2 = G \* M / R, where v is the rotational velocity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius of the galaxy. Rearranging this formula to solve for M, we get: M = v^2 \* R / G.

## Step 3: Calculate the mass of Galaxy B using the radial velocity dispersion
The radial velocity dispersion of a galaxy is related to its mass by the formula: v^2 = G \* M / (2 \* R), where v is the radial velocity dispersion, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius of the galaxy. Rearranging this formula to solve for M, we get: M = 2 \* v^2 \* R / G.

## Step 4: Calculate the mass of Galaxy A
Using the formula derived in Step 2, we can calculate the mass of Galaxy A: M_A = v^2 \* R / G.

## Step 5: Calculate the mass of Galaxy B
Using the formula derived in Step 3, we can calculate the mass of Galaxy B: M_B = 2 \* v^2 \* R / G.

## Step 6: Compare the masses of the two galaxies
Since both galaxies have the same radius and velocity, we can directly compare the masses of the two galaxies.

## Step 7: Simplify the comparison
Divide the mass of Galaxy B by the mass of Galaxy A: M_B / M_A = (2 \* v^2 \* R / G) / (v^2 \* R / G) = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",0.637

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the given problem and identify the required variables.
We are asked to find the density value of a white dwarf star in terms of its total mass M, atomic number Z, mass number A, and other fundamental constants. The electron degeneracy pressure is given by a formula involving the number density of electrons n, and we need to relate this to the gravitational pressure and the density of the star.

## Step 2: Express the number density of electrons n in terms of the density of the star.
The mass density of the star is given by $\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{Am_pn}{V}$, where $m_p$ is the mass of a proton and n is the number density of electrons. Rearranging this to solve for n, we get $n = \frac{\rho}{Am_p}$.

## Step 3: Substitute the expression for n into the formula for electron degeneracy pressure.
Substituting $n = \frac{\rho}{Am_p}$ into the formula for electron degeneracy pressure $p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$, we get $p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}(\frac{\rho}{Am_p})^{5/3}$.

## Step 4: Equate the electron degeneracy pressure to the gravitational pressure.
Equating the electron degeneracy pressure to the gravitational pressure $p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}$, we get $\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}(\frac{\rho}{Am_p})^{5/3} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}$.

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for Ω into the equation and rearrange to solve for ρ.
Substituting $\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$ into the equation and rearranging, we get $\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}(\frac{\rho}{Am_p})^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5R}$, and solving for ρ, we have $\rho = (\frac{5Am_p}{\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}})^{3/5} (\frac{3GM^2}{5R})^{3/5}$.

## Step 6: Express the density ρ in terms of the mass M and radius R.
Since the mass M is related to the radius R by $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho$, we can substitute this expression into the equation for ρ to get $\rho = (\frac{5Am_p}{\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}})^{3/5} (\frac{3G(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho)^2}{5R})^{3/5}$, and simplify to find $\rho = (\frac{9\pi}{4})^{2/5} (\frac{5Am_p}{\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}})^{3/5} (\frac{GM^2}{R^3})^{1/5}$.

## Step 7: Express the density ρ in terms of the total mass M, atomic number Z, mass number A, and other fundamental constants.
Since the mass of the star is $M = ZAm_p$, we can express the radius R in terms of M and other constants, and substitute into the equation for ρ to get $\rho = (\frac{9\pi}{4})^{2/5} (\frac{5Am_p}{\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}})^{3/5} G^{3/5} (ZAm_p)^{6/5}$.

## Step 8: Simplify the expression for ρ to get a final answer.
Combining all the terms and simplifying, we get $\rho = (\frac{5}{2\pi})^{3/5}(\frac{3}{\pi})^{2/5} \frac{3^{3/5}}{4^{6/5}} \frac{(Am_p)^{3}}{\hbar^2} \frac{(Z)^{6/5}}{G^{3/5}}$.

The problem involves an electron orbiting a proton due to Coulombic attraction. We need to find expressions for the total energy and orbital momentum of the electron under the assumption that the proton's mass is much greater than the electron's mass.

## Step 2: Recall the Coulomb's law
The Coulombic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $r$ is the distance between the charges.

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps. We'll use the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum, as well as the properties of elliptical orbits.

## Step 1: Determine the Speed of the Meteorite Just Before Collision
The meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, so its velocity is directed towards the center of the Earth. We can use the conservation of energy to find the speed of the meteorite. The total energy of the meteorite just before collision is equal to its kinetic energy plus its potential energy.

Let's denote the speed of the meteorite as $v_1$. The kinetic energy of the meteorite is $\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2$, and its potential energy is $-\frac{GMm_1}{R}$. The total energy of the meteorite is:

$$E_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 - \frac{GMm_1}{R}$$

Since the meteorite is approaching the Earth, its total energy is negative. At the point of closest approach, the meteorite's velocity is zero, and its potential energy is $-\frac{GMm_1}{R}$. We can equate these two expressions to find the speed of the meteorite:

$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 - \frac{GMm_1}{R} = -\frac{GMm_1}{R}$$

Solving for $v_1$, we get:

$$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

## Step 2: Determine the Minimum and Maximum Speeds of the Conglomerate
After the collision, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit. Since the minimum distance of the conglomerate's orbit is $R/2$, we can assume that the orbit is elliptical.

The minimum speed of the conglomerate occurs at the point of closest approach (perigee), where the distance from the Earth's center is $R/2$. We can use the conservation of angular momentum to find the minimum speed of the conglomerate.

Let's denote the minimum speed of the conglomerate as $v_2$. The angular momentum of the conglomerate is conserved, so we can equate the angular momentum of the meteorite just before collision with the angular momentum of the conglomerate at the point of closest approach:

$$m_1v_1R = (m_1+m_2)v_2(R/2)$$

Substituting the expression for $v_1$ from Step 1, we get:

$$(m_1+m_2)v_2 = 2m_1\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

Solving for $v_2$, we get:

$$v_2 = \frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

The maximum speed of the conglomerate occurs at the point of farthest distance (apogee). Since the orbit is elliptical, we can use the properties of elliptical orbits to find the maximum speed of the conglomerate.

The semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit is $a = \frac{R}{2} + \frac{R}{2} = R$. The eccentricity of the orbit is $e = \frac{R/2 - R}{R} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Using the formula for the velocity at apogee, we get:

$$v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{a}(1-e)} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}(1-\frac{1}{2})} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{2R}}$$

## Step 3: Determine the Maximum Distance of the Conglomerate from the Center of the Earth
The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth occurs at the point of farthest distance (apogee). Using the properties of elliptical orbits, we can find the maximum distance:

$$r_{max} = a(1+e) = R(1+\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{3}{2}R$$

## Step 4: Determine the Condition for m1 and m2
The condition for m1 and m2 can be determined by ensuring that the conglomerate's orbit is closed and elliptical. This means that the total energy of the conglomerate must be negative.

Using the conservation of energy, we can equate the total energy of the conglomerate with the total energy of the meteorite just before collision:

$$\frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_2^2 - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R/2} = -\frac{GMm_1}{R}$$

Substituting the expression for $v_2$ from Step 2, we get:

$$(m_1+m_2)\left(\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}\right)^2\frac{2GM}{R} - 2GM(m_1+m_2) = -2GMm_1$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$m_2(m_1+m_2) > 0$$

This means that both $m_1$ and $m_2$ must be non-zero and have the same sign.

The final answer is: $\boxed{m_2(m_1+m_2) > 0}$",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"## Step 1: Understand the concept of surface magnitude
Surface magnitude is a measure of the magnitude of an object, such as a galaxy, per unit solid angle. This means it takes into account how spread out the object's light is across the sky.

## Step 2: Recall the definition of magnitude
The apparent magnitude of an object is defined as \( m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right) \), where \( F \) is the object's flux (energy received per unit area per unit time) and \( F_0 \) is a reference flux.

## Step 3: Understand how flux relates to distance and solid angle
The flux \( F \) from an object is inversely proportional to the square of the distance \( d \) to the object, \( F \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \). Additionally, the solid angle \( \Omega \) subtended by the object at the observer's location determines how spread out the object's light appears. For small angles, the solid angle is proportional to the square of the angle's radius (or linear size for objects far away).

## Step 4: Relate solid angle to distance through the definition of surface magnitude
The surface magnitude is defined as the magnitude per unit solid angle, implying it's a measure of how bright an object appears per unit area of the sky it covers.

## Step 5: Formulate the relationship between surface magnitude, flux, and solid angle
Given that \( F \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \) and \( \Omega \propto d^2 \) for objects at different distances but appearing the same size in the sky, the surface magnitude, which depends on the flux per unit solid angle (\( \frac{F}{\Omega} \)), should not depend on distance because the \( d^2 \) terms in the flux and the solid angle will cancel out.

## Step 6: Conclude that surface magnitude is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe
From the relationship formulated in Step 5, we can deduce that in a non-expanding universe, where \( F \) and \( \Omega \) are inversely and directly proportional to \( d^2 \) respectively, the surface magnitude remains constant for a given solid angle of the galaxy, irrespective of the distance to the galaxy.

The final answer is: There is no specific number to solve this problem, as the question asks to demonstrate a concept rather than solve for a numerical value.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"**Derivation of Kepler's Laws from the Law of Universal Gravitation**

Kepler's laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun, while the law of universal gravitation describes the gravitational force between two objects. To derive Kepler's laws from the law of universal gravitation, we need to make a few assumptions:

1. The Sun is much more massive than the planets, so we can treat it as a fixed point.
2. The planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun.
3. The gravitational force between the Sun and a planet is the only force acting on the planet.

**Law of Universal Gravitation**

The law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

F = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r^2

where:

* F is the gravitational force between two objects
* G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
* m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects
* r is the distance between the centers of the two objects

**Deriving Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)**

Consider a planet of mass m moving around the Sun of mass M. The gravitational force between the Sun and the planet is given by:

F = G \* (M \* m) / r^2

Since the planet is moving in an elliptical orbit, its distance from the Sun varies. Let's denote the closest distance as r_min and the farthest distance as r_max. The planet's velocity at these points is perpendicular to the radius vector.

Using the concept of conservation of angular momentum, we can write:

L = m \* v \* r = constant

where v is the velocity of the planet.

Since the planet's velocity is tangent to the orbit, we can write:

v = sqrt(G \* M / r)

Substituting this expression for v into the conservation of angular momentum equation, we get:

r^2 = h^2 / (G \* M \* m)

where h is a constant.

This equation represents an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the foci. Therefore, we have derived Kepler's first law: **the orbits of the planets are elliptical in shape, with the Sun at one of the two foci**.

**Deriving Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)**

Consider a small time interval Δt, during which the planet moves from point P1 to point P2 on its orbit.

The area swept out by the planet's radius vector during this time interval is:

ΔA = (1/2) \* r1 \* r2 \* sin(θ)

where θ is the angle between the two radius vectors.

Using the concept of conservation of angular momentum, we can write:

L = m \* v \* r = constant

Differentiating this equation with respect to time, we get:

dL/dt = m \* a \* r + m \* v \* (dr/dt) = 0

where a is the acceleration of the planet.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

v \* (dr/dt) = -a \* r

Substituting this expression into the equation for ΔA, we get:

ΔA = (1/2) \* r1 \* r2 \* sin(θ) = (1/2) \* r^2 \* (v \* dt) / r

Cancelling out the r terms, we get:

ΔA = (1/2) \* v \* dt

Since the planet's velocity is constant at a given distance from the Sun, the area swept out by the planet's radius vector in a given time interval is constant. Therefore, we have derived Kepler's second law: **the line connecting the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times**.

**Deriving Kepler's Third Law (Law of Harmonies)**

Consider a planet of mass m moving around the Sun of mass M. The gravitational force between the Sun and the planet is given by:

F = G \* (M \* m) / r^2

Since the planet is moving in an elliptical orbit, its velocity is given by:

v = sqrt(G \* M / r)

The planet's orbital period T is given by:

T = 2 \* π \* sqrt(r^3 / (G \* M))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

T^2 = (4 \* π^2 / G) \* (r^3 / M)

This equation represents Kepler's third law: **the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis**.

In conclusion, we have derived Kepler's three laws from the law of universal gravitation, which describes the gravitational force between two objects.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude:

We are tasked with deriving expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for two cases: the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy and a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

## Step 2: Recall the relationship between rotational velocity and angular velocity
The rotational velocity $V$ is related to the angular velocity $\Omega$ by $V = \Omega R$, where $R$ is the distance from the Galactic Centre.

## Step 3: Derive the expression for the radial gradient of rotational velocity in terms of angular velocity
Using the chain rule, we can write $\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d(\Omega R)}{dR} = \Omega + R\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$.

## Step 4: Evaluate the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the actual observed rotation curve
For the actual observed rotation curve, the expression for $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$ is $\Omega_{0} + R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$. We do not have enough information to evaluate $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$ for this case.

## Step 5: Evaluate the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the hypothetical scenario
For the hypothetical scenario, the Galaxy is assumed to be a point mass, so the rotational velocity is given by $V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the total mass of the Galaxy. We can write $\Omega = \frac{V}{R} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^{3}}}$. Evaluating the radial gradient at the location of the Sun, we have $\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^{5}}}$. Substituting this expression into the equation for $\frac{dV}{dR}$, we get $\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^{3}}}$.

## Step 6: Derive expressions for the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for the two cases
Case I (actual observed rotation curve): $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \Omega_{0} + R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$.
Case II (hypothetical scenario): $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_{0}^{3}}}$.

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"## Step 1: Recall the given equations for the line-of-sight velocity (Vr) and transverse velocity (Vt) components.
The line-of-sight velocity (Vr) and transverse velocity (Vt) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$.

## Step 2: Recall Jan Oort's first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components.
Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components: $V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$.

## Step 3: Express the first order approximation of (Ω−Ω0)R0 in terms of A, B, and ω.
Considering that $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$ and $V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$, with D≈R0sinl (since D≪R0), we can equate the two expressions for Vr to get  $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = 2AD\cos l$. Also, we can rewrite the equation $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$ as $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l  = V_{\mathrm{t}} + \Omega D$. Then by equating this equation with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$, we have $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l = AD\cos2l + BD + \Omega D$. Finally, using  $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = 2AD\cos l$ gives us $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = A\frac{D}{\cos l}\cos2l + B\frac{D}{\cos l} + \frac{V\sin l}{R_{0}}\cdot \frac{R_{0}}{\cos l} = A\frac{D}{\cos l}\cos2l + B\frac{D}{\cos l} + V\tan l$.

## Step 4: Perform the Taylor series expansion of (Ω−Ω0)R0.
$(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = \frac{d\Omega}{dR}(R-R_{0})R_{0} = -\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}^{2}}\frac{dV}{dR}(R-R_{0})R_{0}$. Also, note that $V = V_{0}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})$.

## Step 5:  Calculate A and B in terms of the given parameters.
We now expand $(R-R_{0})$ as  $R-R_{0} = R_{0}+D\sin l-R_{0} = D\sin l$. Next, we rewrite $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = 2AD\cos l$ as  $-\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\frac{dV}{dR}D\sin l\cos l = 2AD\cos l$ and $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = A\frac{D}{\cos l}\cos2l + B\frac{D}{\cos l} + V\tan l$ as  $-\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\frac{dV}{dR}D\sin l\cos l = A D \cos2l + B D+ V\tan l$. Comparing these two equations, we can get that $\frac{A}{2}=-\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\frac{dV}{dR}$ and $B + A\tan^{2}l\tan l = -V\tan l$.

## Step 6: Derive the final expressions of A and B in terms of V0, R0, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity.
Therefore, combining the terms with $A$ we can now write $A = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R=R_{0}}$. Next, we note that B+2A\tan^{2}l\tan l =- V\tan l. Considering the Taylor series expansion for $V$ and $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})R_{0}$ from previous steps, rewrite the first term of the equation $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} =  A\frac{D}{\cos l}\cos2l + B\frac{D}{\cos l} + V\tan l$. To do so we use  $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})R_{0} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} \frac{dV}{dR}(R-R_{0})R_{0}$ and  $V = V_{0}+\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})$, and expand $(R-R_{0}) = R_{0}+D\sin l-R_{0} = D\sin l$, in order to find a Taylor series expansion of B. Now equating this expansion with the above equation B+2A\tan^{2}l\tan l =- V\tan l and compare the expansions of $V\tan l$ and $-B$, we can get that $B= A$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A=B=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R=R_{0}}}$",0.728

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the problem and the scenario
The problem describes the accretion of matter onto a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole. We are given a gas element of mass $\Delta m$ in a thin disc with a maximum radius $R_{max}$ and a minimum stable orbital radius $R_{min}$, rotating around a compact object of mass M and radius R. We need to find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by this gas as it orbits from $R_{max}$ to a radius r ≪ $R_{max}$.

## Step 2: Identify the key components of the system
- The gas element of mass $\Delta m$.
- The compact object of mass M and radius R.
- The disc with maximum radius $R_{max}$ and minimum stable orbital radius $R_{min}$.
- The gas element follows a Keplerian circular orbit.

## Step 3: Recall the relevant equations
The total mechanical energy of an object in orbit around a compact object is the sum of its kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (U). In a Keplerian orbit, these are given by:
\[T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\]
\[U = -\frac{GMm}{r}\]
where $v$ is the orbital velocity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the compact object, $m$ is the mass of the orbiting object, and $r$ is the orbital radius.

For a Keplerian orbit, the orbital velocity is given by:
\[v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}\]

## Step 4: Calculate the total mechanical energy per unit mass
Substituting $v$ into the expression for kinetic energy and simplifying:
\[T = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}\right)^2 = \frac{GMm}{2r}\]
The potential energy per unit mass is:
\[U/m = -\frac{GM}{r}\]
So, the total mechanical energy per unit mass is:
\[\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = T/m + U/m = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}\]

## Step 5: Consider the energy released as the gas orbits from $R_{max}$ to r ≪ $R_{max}$
Since the process occurs slowly and the energy is dissipated as heat, the difference in mechanical energy per unit mass is:
\[\Delta\left(\frac{E}{m}\right) = \left(-\frac{GM}{2r}\right) - \left(-\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}\right)\]

## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the energy released
\[\Delta\left(\frac{E}{m}\right) = -\frac{GM}{2r} + \frac{GM}{2R_{max}} = GM\left(\frac{1}{2R_{max}} - \frac{1}{2r}\right) = \frac{GM}{2}\left(\frac{1}{R_{max}} - \frac{1}{r}\right)\]
However, we should express our answer directly in terms of G, M, and r, as instructed in the problem. Since r ≪ $R_{max}$, the term $\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$ is negligible compared to $\frac{GM}{2r}$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[\Delta\left(\frac{E}{m}\right) \approx -\frac{GM}{2r}\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{GM}{2r}}$",0.728

The cosmologist is proposing a thought experiment to measure the Hubble constant \(H_0\) in a Steady-State Universe model. This involves sending a laser beam towards a mirror placed at a distance \(D\) from the Solar System and measuring the time \(T\) it takes for the radiation to return.

## Step 2: Identify the key components and relationships.
The key components are the distance to the mirror \(D\), the speed of light \(c\), and the time for the radiation to return \(T\). The relationship between the distance and time is influenced by the expansion of the universe, characterized by the Hubble constant \(H_0\).

## Step 3: Formulate the relationship between distance and expansion of the universe.
Given the law \(S = se^{H_0t}\), where \(S\) is the separation at time \(t\), \(s\) is the initial separation, and \(H_0\) is the Hubble constant.

## Step 4: Apply the given law to the thought experiment.
Since the mirror is at distance \(D\) initially, we are interested in how the distance \(D\) changes due to the expansion of the universe over time \(t = \frac{T}{2}\) (since the radiation has to travel to the mirror and back).

## Step 5: Calculate the expression for \(H_0\) based on the thought experiment.
When the radiation is sent towards the mirror, the universe expands, increasing the distance the radiation needs to travel. By the time the radiation returns, the total distance traveled by the radiation is twice the initial distance \(D\) plus the additional distance due to the expansion. However, because the mirror also moves away, we need to consider the expansion affecting the distance.

Using \(S = se^{H_0t}\), the change in distance \(\delta D\) due to the expansion is \(D(e^{H_0\frac{T}{2}} - 1)\).

## Step 6: Approximate \(e^{H_0t}\) using the given approximation for small \(x\).
Since the Hubble constant times the time might be small, \(e^{H_0t} \approx 1 + H_0t\). Therefore, the change in distance due to the expansion is approximately \(D(H_0\frac{T}{2})\).

## Step 7: Calculate the total distance the radiation traveled including expansion.
The total distance the radiation traveled is the initial distance to the mirror, the additional distance due to expansion, and the same path back: \(2D + 2D(H_0\frac{T}{2})\).

## Step 8: Use the speed of light to relate distance and time.
The total distance traveled by the radiation equals the speed of light times the total time \(T\): \(cT = 2D + 2D(H_0\frac{T}{2})\).

## Step 9: Solve for \(H_0\).
Rearranging the equation to solve for \(H_0\), we get \(H_0 = \frac{2c - 2D/T}{D}\).

## Step 10: Simplify the expression.
Given \(cT = 2D + DH_0T\), rearranging, we find \(H_0 = \frac{2(c - D/T)}{D}\).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2(c - D/T)}{D}}$",0.728

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"## Step 1: Identify the given information and constraints.
The problem states that we are dealing with a binary neutron star system where two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. We are also told that the system's total gravitational wave luminosity, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated using a single term that includes a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and the variables $M$ and $R$. Additionally, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power.

## Step 2: Determine the dimensionality of the variables involved.
The variables involved are:
- $L_{GW}$ (luminosity), which has dimensions of energy per unit time (erg/s or J/s).
- $G$ (gravitational constant), which has dimensions of length^3 per unit mass per unit time^2 (m^3/kg/s^2).
- $c$ (speed of light), which has dimensions of length per unit time (m/s).
- $M$ (mass), which has dimensions of mass (kg).
- $R$ (radius), which has dimensions of length (m).

## Step 3: Apply dimensional analysis to the variables.
Since $L_{GW}$ is the only variable that includes energy, the approximation must include a term that combines $G$ and $M$ in a way that results in energy, potentially per unit time. We know that the energy involved in gravitational interactions can be represented by $G \cdot M^2/R$, which, when combined with $c$ and the proper dimensionless constant, would give us energy per unit time.

## Step 4: Determine the correct combination of variables to match the dimensions of $L_{GW}$.
Since we know that $L_{GW}$ involves the release of energy over time and is likewise dependent on $M$, $R$, $c$, and $G$, we can hypothesize that the formula will involve terms that give us an energy output per unit time, likely incorporating $G \cdot M^2/R$ and adjusting it with powers of $c$ to fit the dimensionality of luminosity, which is energy per unit time.

## Step 5: Incorporate the given dimensionless constant and solve for the correct expression.
The problem provides us with a dimensionless constant of $\frac{2}{5}$ and states that both $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power in the equation. Given this, we can infer that $L_{GW}$ must involve $c^4/R^2$ to match dimensions (since $L_{GW} \sim G \cdot M^2/R$ needs to be adjusted by $c$ to the fourth power to fit the luminosity dimensionality of erg/s or J/s, and both $c$ and $R$ must have the same exponent). Therefore, combining this with the given dimensionless constant, we get:
\[L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{G \cdot M^2}{R} \cdot \frac{c^4}{R^2}\]
Simplifying this expression gives us:
\[L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{G \cdot M^2 \cdot c^4}{R^3}\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{G \cdot M^2 \cdot c^4}{R^3}}$",0.637
27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given expression
We are given a binary neutron star system where two neutron stars of mass $M$ each are in a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. The expression for the luminosity of gravitational waves $L_{GW}$ is provided as $\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$. We need to find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, which represents the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time.

## Step 2: Recall the relation between energy loss and radius change
In a Newtonian circular orbit, the total energy $E$ can be expressed in terms of the mass $M$ and the radius $R$ as $E = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}$. We also know that the luminosity of gravitational waves $L_{GW}$ is related to the energy loss of the system, which in turn affects the change in radius over time.

## Step 3: Derive the expression for the energy loss rate
Using the given expression for $L_{GW}$, we can equate it to the energy loss rate $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$. This gives us $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.

## Step 4: Express the energy loss rate in terms of radius change
From step 2, we have $E = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to time, we get $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$.

## Step 5: Equate the expressions for energy loss rate and solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$
Equating the expressions from steps 3 and 4, we have $\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$. Solving for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, we get $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{4G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}}$",0.49
