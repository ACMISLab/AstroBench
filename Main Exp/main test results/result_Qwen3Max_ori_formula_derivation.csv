2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"To derive the **virial theorem** based on **Newton’s second law**, we begin by considering a system of many particles (e.g., stars in a galaxy or molecules in a gas), each of mass \( m_i \), position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \), and subject to forces \( \mathbf{F}_i \). The goal is to relate the time-averaged kinetic energy of the system to the virial, defined as \( \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \).

---

### Step 1: Define a key quantity — the scalar moment of inertia

We start by defining the **scalar moment of inertia** of the system about the origin:

\[
I = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_i m_i r_i^2
\]

This is not the tensor moment of inertia, but a scalar useful for this derivation.

---

### Step 2: Take the second time derivative of \( I \)

We compute \( \ddot{I} = \frac{d^2 I}{dt^2} \).

First derivative:

\[
\dot{I} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right) = \sum_i m_i (2 \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i ) = 2 \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i
\]

Second derivative:

\[
\ddot{I} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 2 \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = 2 \sum_i m_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i \right)
\]

But \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{v}_i \), so \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i = v_i^2 \), and \( \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = \mathbf{a}_i \). Thus:

\[
\ddot{I} = 2 \sum_i m_i (v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i )
\]

Now recall **Newton’s second law**: \( m_i \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{F}_i \), so:

\[
\ddot{I} = 2 \sum_i m_i v_i^2 + 2 \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

Note that the total kinetic energy \( T \) of the system is:

\[
T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2T
\]

Therefore:

\[
\ddot{I} = 4T + 2 \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

---

### Step 3: Time-average over a long period

For a **bound, stable system** (like a galaxy or star cluster in steady state), the moment of inertia \( I \) does not grow indefinitely. Over a long time interval \( \tau \), the time average of \( \ddot{I} \) tends to zero:

\[
\left\langle \ddot{I} \right\rangle = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \ddot{I}(t)\, dt = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{\dot{I}(\tau) - \dot{I}(0)}{\tau} \to 0
\]

(because \( \dot{I} \) remains bounded for a bound system).

Thus, taking the time average of both sides:

\[
0 = 4 \langle T \rangle + 2 \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

---

### Step 4: Identify the virial

By definition, the **virial** is \( \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \). So the **virial theorem** states:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \langle \text{Virial} \rangle = 0
\]

Or equivalently:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle = - \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle
\]

---

### Step 5: Special case — conservative forces from a potential

If the forces are derived from a **potential energy** \( U \), such that \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), and if the potential is a homogeneous function of degree \( n \) in the coordinates (e.g., gravitational potential \( \propto 1/r \), which is degree \( -1 \)), then by Euler’s theorem:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = n U
\]

So:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = - \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -n U
\]

Thus, the virial theorem becomes:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle = n \langle U \rangle
\]

For **gravity**, the pairwise potential is \( U \propto -G m_i m_j / r_{ij} \), which is homogeneous of degree \( n = -1 \), so:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\]

or

\[
\langle T \rangle + \frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle = 0
\]

This is the familiar form used in astrophysics to estimate masses of galaxies and clusters.

---

### Final Answer: Virial Theorem Formula

Starting from Newton’s second law, the virial theorem is derived as:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

where:
- \( T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 \) is the total kinetic energy,
- \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the net force on particle \( i \),
- angle brackets denote a long-term time average.

This is the general form of the **virial theorem**.",0.546

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$.

\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Take the time derivative:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
$$

Swap the order of summation:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that the double sum includes each pair $(i,j)$ with $i \ne j$ **twice**: once as $(i,j)$ and once as $(j,i)$. Consider the pair contribution:

- From $(i,j)$: term is $ \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $
- From $(j,i)$: term is $ \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $

So they cancel pairwise. Hence:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}.
$$

### 2. **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**

Define total angular momentum:
$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

Take time derivative:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

The first term vanishes because $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0$, so:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Simplify the cross product:
$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

So:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = G \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Now consider swapping $i \leftrightarrow j$. The term becomes:
$$
\frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i) = \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Thus, the pair $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ again cancel:
$$
\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) = 0.
$$

Therefore:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **Second integral**: **Total angular momentum is conserved.**

### 3. **Conservation of Total Energy**

The total mechanical energy is kinetic plus potential:
$$
E = T + U,
$$
where
$$
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2,
$$
and the gravitational potential energy (note: factor of 1/2 avoids double-counting):
$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

Take time derivative of total energy:
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt}.
$$

Compute $ \frac{dT}{dt} $:
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

So:
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = -G \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Now compute $ \frac{dU}{dt} $. Since $ r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| $, we have:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \frac{dr_{ij}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \cdot \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{r_{ij}} = -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{r_{ij}^3}.
$$

Thus:
$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} G m_i m_j \cdot \left( -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{r_{ij}^3} \right)
= \frac{G}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Expand the dot product:
$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j.
$$

So:
$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{G}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right].
$$

Now relabel indices in the second term: swap $i \leftrightarrow j$. Note that $r_{ij} = r_{ji}$, and the sum over $i \ne j$ is symmetric. The second term becomes:
$$
- \frac{G}{2} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{G}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

So both terms are equal! Therefore:
$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = G \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

But recall:
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = -G \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Hence:
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0.
$$

✅ **Third integral**: **Total energy is conserved.**

### Summary: First Integrals of Motion

For the Newtonian N-body problem, the following **ten** scalar first integrals exist (due to Galilean invariance):

1. **3 components of total linear momentum** $ \mathbf{P} $ → 3 integrals  
2. **3 components of total angular momentum** $ \mathbf{L} $ → 3 integrals  
3. **1 total energy** $ E $ → 1 integral  
4. **3 components of center-of-mass position** (or motion): since $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum m_i \mathbf{r}_i $, and $ \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0 $, then $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t $. So the initial center-of-mass position and velocity give 6 constants, but only **3 additional independent integrals** beyond linear momentum: usually taken as the **center-of-mass coordinates at $ t=0 $** or the fact that the center of mass moves uniformly.

However, strictly speaking, the **first integrals directly derived from the equations of motion** (without integrating further) are:

- Conservation of **linear momentum** $ \mathbf{P} $
- Conservation of **angular momentum** $ \mathbf{L} $
- Conservation of **energy** $ E $

The uniform motion of the center of mass follows from $ \dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 $, so $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t $, which implies that **the center-of-mass velocity is constant**, giving no new independent conserved *scalar* beyond $ \mathbf{P} $. However, one can define integrals like $ \mathbf{K} = \sum m_i (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{v}_i t) $, the **center-of-mass position at $ t=0 $**, which is also conserved. This is sometimes called the **conservation of the center-of-mass motion** and gives 3 more integrals.

Thus, total number of **independent first integrals** for the N-body problem is **10** (for $ N \ge 2 $):

- 3 (linear momentum)
- 3 (angular momentum)
- 1 (energy)
- 3 (center-of-mass initial position or boost integrals)

But in many contexts, especially when asking to ""derive the first integrals from the dynamical equation"", the expected answer includes:

> **Total linear momentum, total angular momentum, and total energy are conserved.**

These are the fundamental first integrals arising from the symmetries of the Newtonian gravitational N-body system.

✅ **Final Answer**:

The first integrals of motion for the N-body system are:

1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
   $$

2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{constant}
   $$

3. **Conservation of total mechanical energy**:  
   $$
   E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}
   $$

These follow from the translational, rotational, and time-translation symmetries of the system, respectively.",0.714

1. **Conservation of angular momentum**
2. **Vis-viva equation** (which comes from conservation of energy)

We are given:
- $ a $: semi-major axis of the ellipse
- $ e $: eccentricity of the orbit ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $)
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $: standard gravitational parameter (for $ M \gg m $, as in Sun–planet systems)

We aim to show:
$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Recall key distances in an elliptical orbit

For an ellipse with semi-major axis $ a $ and eccentricity $ e $, the distances from the focus (where the central mass is located) to:

- **Perihelion** (closest point):  
  $$
  r_P = a(1 - e)
  $$

- **Aphelion** (farthest point):  
  $$
  r_A = a(1 + e)
  $$

---

### Step 2: Use the vis-viva equation

The **vis-viva equation** relates the speed $ v $ of an object in an orbit to its distance $ r $ from the central body:

$$
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

This is derived from conservation of mechanical energy in a gravitational field.

#### Apply to perihelion:

At perihelion, $ r = r_P = a(1 - e) $. So,

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Thus,
$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $ v_P $.

#### Apply to aphelion:

At aphelion, $ r = r_A = a(1 + e) $. So,

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Thus,
$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $ v_A $.

---

### Alternative approach: Conservation of angular momentum

At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity vector is **perpendicular** to the radius vector (since these are turning points in radial distance), so angular momentum magnitude is:

$$
h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$

So:
$$
a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow \frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

This ratio is consistent with the expressions above:
$$
\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{ \sqrt{(1 + e)/(1 - e)} }{ \sqrt{(1 - e)/(1 + e)} } = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

So both conservation laws agree.

---

### Final Answer

Using the **vis-viva equation**, we have proven that for a celestial body in an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $ a $, eccentricity $ e $, and gravitational parameter $ \mu $, the velocities at **aphelion** and **perihelion** are:

$$
\boxed{
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}

- We are to find the orbital **period** $P$ as a function of $d$

This is **not** the usual spherical planet problem! The gravitational field of an **infinitely long uniform cylinder** is different from that of a sphere.

---

### Step 1: Gravitational field of an infinite cylinder

For an **infinitely long straight cylinder** with uniform mass density, we can use **Gauss’s law for gravity**, analogous to Gauss’s law in electrostatics.

Gauss’s law for gravity:
$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Because of symmetry, the gravitational field $\vec{g}$ points radially inward toward the axis of the cylinder and has constant magnitude at a fixed radial distance $d$.

Choose a **cylindrical Gaussian surface** of radius $d$ and length $L$, coaxial with the planet.

- The flux through the end caps is zero (field is radial).
- The flux through the curved surface: $g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L)$

Enclosed mass: only the mass of the planet inside radius $R$ (since the satellite is at $d > R$, and the planet has radius $R$). So for length $L$, the enclosed mass is:

$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \text{density} \times \text{volume} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)
$$

Apply Gauss’s law:

$$
g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

Wait! Hold on. Let's double-check the right-hand side.

Actually, Gauss’s law for gravity is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

So:

$$
g(d) (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \cdot \pi R^2 L)
$$

But this seems to have an extra $\pi$. Wait—mass is $\rho \cdot (\text{volume}) = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)$. That’s correct.

So:

$$
g(d) = -\frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Wait—that gives units? Let's check dimensions:

- $[\rho] = M/L^3$
- $[R^2] = L^2$
- So $\rho R^2 = M / L$
- Multiply by $G$: $[G] = L^3/(M T^2)$ → $G \rho R^2 = L^2 / T^2$
- Divide by $d$ (L): gives $L / T^2$ → acceleration. OK.

But actually, I think there's a standard result: For an infinite line mass with linear mass density $\lambda$, the gravitational field at distance $d$ is:

$$
g = \frac{2G\lambda}{d}
$$

(Attractive, so direction is inward.)

Now, for our cylinder, the **linear mass density** (mass per unit length) is:

$$
\lambda = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
$$

So gravitational acceleration at distance $d > R$ is:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2G\lambda}{d} = \frac{2G \rho \pi R^2}{d}
$$

Note: This matches the magnitude we got above **if** we fix the earlier algebra:

From Gauss’s law:

$$
g(d) (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} = 4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
\Rightarrow g(d) = \frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Wait—now I see the confusion: The standard Gauss’s law in **SI units** is:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -4\pi G \rho
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

So magnitude:

$$
|g| (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
\Rightarrow |g| = \frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

But the standard result using Newtonian gravity for line mass is $g = 2G\lambda/d = 2G(\rho \pi R^2)/d$

So which is correct?

Compare:

- From line mass: $g = \frac{2G \rho \pi R^2}{d}$
- From Gauss: $g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}$

These differ by a factor of $\pi$!

Ah! The error is in Gauss’s law constant. In **Gaussian (cgs) units**, Gauss’s law for gravity is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

That is correct.

But let’s derive the field directly from known results.

### Step 2: Use known gravitational field of infinite cylinder

It is a standard result in classical mechanics that the gravitational field **outside** a uniform infinite cylinder of radius $R$ and volume density $\rho$ is:

$$
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho \frac{R^2}{d}, \quad \text{for } d \ge R
$$

Yes! This is the correct expression. Let’s verify via dimensional analysis and limiting behavior.

Alternatively, compute linear mass density:

$$
\lambda = \text{mass per unit length} = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
$$

Gravitational field due to infinite line mass: $g = 2G\lambda / d = 2G (\rho \pi R^2)/d = 2\pi G \rho R^2 / d$

✅ So both agree! Because $2G \cdot \pi = 2\pi G$. So no discrepancy.

Thus,

$$
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

This is the **magnitude** of the gravitational acceleration at distance $d$ from the axis.

---

### Step 3: Satellite in circular orbit

Assume the satellite moves in a **circular orbit** around the cylinder, in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder's axis (the only stable possibility due to symmetry).

For circular motion, centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $d$:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital speed **does not depend on** $d$ (as long as $d > R$). This is analogous to the flat rotation curves in galaxies — a hallmark of cylindrical (or line) mass distributions.

Now, period $P$ is related to speed by:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}
\Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2}
$$

Set equal to above:

$$
\frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2} = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Solve for $P$:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
P = \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} } \cdot d
$$

So the period is **proportional to** $d$, the orbital radius.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = d \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} }}
$$

Or equivalently,

$$
P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho} }
$$

This expresses the orbital period $P$ of a satellite around an infinitely long cylindrical planet of radius $R$ and uniform density $\rho$, in terms of its distance $d$ from the cylinder’s axis.",0.637

---

### **Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy (Rotationally Supported)**

Spiral galaxies are **rotationally supported**, meaning that the orbital motion of stars and gas around the center provides the necessary centripetal force to balance gravitational attraction.

We are told:
- At radius \( r = R \), the **rotational velocity** is \( v \).
- The galaxy has radius \( R \).

Assuming that most of the mass is **within radius \( R \)** (a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise), we can model the mass distribution as spherically symmetric for the purpose of gravitational force (even though the galaxy is disk-like, this is a common approximation in introductory dynamics).

Using **Newtonian circular orbit dynamics**:

\[
\frac{G M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

This comes from equating gravitational acceleration to centripetal acceleration:

\[
\frac{G M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ **Mass of Galaxy A**:  
\[
\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
\]

### **Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy (Pressure-Supported)**

Elliptical galaxies are **pressure-supported**, meaning that random stellar motions (characterized by velocity dispersion \( \sigma \)) provide the support against gravity, rather than ordered rotation.

We are told:
- Galaxy B is **spherical**, **uniform**, and composed of evenly spaced stars (i.e., constant density \( \rho \) within radius \( R \)).
- The **radial velocity dispersion** is \( \sigma = v \).
- Radius is \( R \).

To relate mass and velocity dispersion in a self-gravitating system, we use the **virial theorem** or solve the **Jeans equation** for a spherical, isotropic system.

Because the problem states the galaxy is **uniform** (constant density), we can use a simplified form of the **virial theorem** or a more precise result from the **spherical Jeans equation** under the assumption of isotropy and constant density.

---

#### **Approach 1: Virial Theorem Estimate**

The scalar virial theorem states:

\[
2K + U = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2K = -U
\]

For a system with mass \( M_B \) and size \( R \):

- Kinetic energy: \( K \approx \frac{1}{2} M_B \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{2} M_B v^2 \)
- Gravitational potential energy for a uniform sphere: \( U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} \)

Apply virial theorem:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]
\[
M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]

Cancel \( M_B \) (assuming \( M_B \ne 0 \)):

\[
v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_B = \frac{5}{3} \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ **Mass of Galaxy B (Virial Estimate)**:  
\[
\boxed{M_B = \frac{5}{3} \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
\]

---

#### **Approach 2: Spherical Jeans Equation (More Accurate for Given Assumptions)**

For a spherical, isotropic, steady-state system, the Jeans equation is:

\[
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho(r) \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
\]

Given:
- Constant density \( \rho = \text{const} \) for \( r \leq R \), and zero beyond.
- Isotropic velocity dispersion: \( \sigma_r = \sigma = v \) (given as constant? The problem says ""radial velocity dispersion is equal to v""—but does not specify if it's constant with radius.)

However, **in a real uniform sphere, \( \sigma \) cannot be constant**—it must decrease outward to satisfy boundary conditions (e.g., \( \sigma \to 0 \) at surface). But since the problem states ""radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v"", it likely means **the characteristic or central value is v**, and we're to estimate mass using standard approximations.

Given the problem’s phrasing and the uniformity assumption, the **virial theorem approach is appropriate and expected** at this level.

Moreover, for a uniform density sphere, solving the Jeans equation with the boundary condition that the distribution function vanishes at the edge yields (see Binney & Tremaine, *Galactic Dynamics*):

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{G M}{5 R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad M = \frac{5 \sigma^2 R}{G}
\]

Wait! This differs from the virial result above. Let's double-check.

Actually, **for an isotropic, uniform sphere**, the exact solution of the Jeans equation gives:

- Total mass: \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \)
- From Jeans equation integration, one finds (see standard derivations):

\[
\sigma^2(0) = \frac{G M}{10 R} \cdot 6 = \frac{3 G M}{5 R} \quad \text{?}
\]

Let me derive it carefully.

---

### **Exact Jeans Solution for Uniform Sphere**

Assume:
- \( \rho(r) = \rho_0 \) for \( r \leq R \), 0 otherwise.
- Isotropic: \( \sigma_r = \sigma \), and we assume \( \sigma \) may vary with \( r \), but we are given a **characteristic** dispersion \( v \). However, the problem says ""radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v""—likely implying that **at radius R**, or **as a representative value**, \( \sigma = v \).

But in pressure-supported systems, we usually relate **central** or **average** dispersion to mass.

However, many textbooks use the following rule-of-thumb for ellipticals:

\[
M \approx \frac{k \sigma^2 R}{G}
\]

where \( k \sim 5 \) for uniform spheres.

But let’s use the **virial theorem with correct potential energy**.

Potential energy of uniform sphere:  
\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M^2}{R}
\]

Kinetic energy: For isotropic 3D dispersion, total kinetic energy is:

\[
K = \frac{3}{2} M \sigma^2
\]

Wait! Important point: **velocity dispersion \( \sigma \) is per component**. So if \( \sigma_r = v \), and isotropic, then total mean-square velocity is \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma^2 \), so kinetic energy is:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} M (3 \sigma^2) = \frac{3}{2} M \sigma^2
\]

But the problem says ""**radial velocity dispersion is equal to v**"", so \( \sigma_r = v \). Assuming isotropy, \( \sigma_r = \sigma_\theta = \sigma_\phi = v \), so yes, \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2 \).

Thus, \( K = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \)

Now apply virial theorem: \( 2K + U = 0 \)

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]
\[
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]

Cancel 3 and \( M_B \):

\[
v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
\]

Ah! So earlier I mistakenly used \( K = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 \), but that’s only if \( v \) is the total speed. Since \( v \) is the **radial dispersion** (one component), total kinetic energy is larger.

✅ Therefore, correct virial mass for Galaxy B:

\[
\boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
\]

---

### **Final Comparison**

- Galaxy A (spiral, rotation-supported):  
  \[
  M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
  \]

- Galaxy B (elliptical, dispersion-supported, uniform sphere):  
  \[
  M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
  \]

Thus, **Galaxy B is 5 times more massive** than Galaxy A, even though both have the same size and the same characteristic velocity scale \( v \).

This highlights a key point in galactic dynamics: **dispersion-supported systems require more mass to sustain the same velocity scale** because random motions are less efficient at providing support than ordered rotation.

---

### ✅ Final Answers:

- **Mass of Galaxy A**: \( \displaystyle M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \)
- **Mass of Galaxy B**: \( \displaystyle M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G} \)",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"We are asked to find the **density** of a white dwarf as a function of its total mass $ M $, the atomic number $ Z $, mass number $ A $, and fundamental constants. This involves balancing **electron degeneracy pressure** against **gravitational pressure**, using the given expressions.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

- The white dwarf is supported by **electron degeneracy pressure**.
- Electrons come from ionized atoms: each nucleus has charge $ +Ze $, so contributes $ Z $ electrons.
- Nuclei have mass number $ A $, so mass per nucleus ≈ $ A m_p $ (where $ m_p $ is proton mass; we neglect neutron-proton mass difference and binding energy).
- Total mass of star: $ M $
- Radius of star: $ R $
- Volume: $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $
- Density: $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} $

We aim to find $ \rho = \rho(M, A, Z, \text{constants}) $

---

### Step 2: Express electron number density $ n $

Let’s find number of electrons per unit volume:

- Number of nuclei in star: $ N_{\text{nuc}} = \frac{M}{A m_p} $
- Number of electrons: $ N_e = Z N_{\text{nuc}} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p} $
- Volume: $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $
- So electron number density:
  $$
  n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p R^3}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Write expressions for pressures

#### Electron degeneracy pressure:

Given:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
$$

#### Gravitational pressure:

Given:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3 G M^2}{5 R}
$$
So:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V}
$$
But $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $, so:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

---

### Step 4: Set pressures equal (hydrostatic equilibrium)

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

Substitute both sides:

Left-hand side (LHS):
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
$$

Right-hand side (RHS):
$$
\frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

Now substitute $ n = \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p R^3} $ into LHS.

First compute $ n^{5/3} $:

$$
n^{5/3} = \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \cdot R^{-5}
$$

Because $ (R^{-3})^{5/3} = R^{-5} $

So LHS becomes:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5}
$$

Set equal to RHS:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5}
= \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ R^5 $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
= \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi} R
$$

Now solve for $ R $:

$$
R = \frac{20 \pi \hbar^2}{5 m_e \cdot 3 G M^2} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Simplify constants:

- $ \frac{20 \pi}{5 \cdot 3} = \frac{4 \pi}{3} $

So:

$$
R = \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G M^2} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Now simplify the $ M $ dependence:

- $ M^{-2} \cdot M^{5/3} = M^{-1/3} $

So:

$$
R = \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

This shows the well-known result: **white dwarf radius decreases with increasing mass** ($ R \propto M^{-1/3} $).

---

### Step 5: Compute density $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} $

We now plug the expression for $ R $ into this.

First compute $ R^3 $:

$$
R^3 = \left[ \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3 M^{-1}
$$

So:

$$
R^3 = K \cdot M^{-1}, \quad \text{where } K = \left[ \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3
$$

Then:

$$
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{K} \cdot M = \frac{3}{4\pi K} M^2
$$

So **density scales as $ M^2 $** — another classic white dwarf result.

Now write full expression for $ \rho $:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{ \left[ \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3 } \cdot M^2
$$

We can simplify this expression.

Let’s denote:

- Constant part: collect all terms.

Start by inverting the cube:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4 \pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{-5} \cdot M^2
$$

Wait: careful with exponents.

We have:

- $ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} $ cubed → $ (3\pi^2)^2 $
- $ \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} $ cubed → $ \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^5 $

So denominator has those; when inverted, they go to numerator with negative exponent.

Thus:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4 \pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{-5} \cdot M^2
$$

Now simplify the last factor:

$$
\left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{-5} = \left( \frac{4 \pi A m_p}{3 Z} \right)^5
$$

So:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4 \pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2} \cdot \left( \frac{4 \pi A m_p}{3 Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
$$

Now combine constants.

Let’s group powers of 3, 4, π, etc.

First, write all together:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{(3 m_e G)^3}{(4 \pi \hbar^2)^3} \cdot \frac{1}{9 \pi^4} \cdot \frac{(4 \pi A m_p)^5}{(3 Z)^5} \cdot M^2
$$

Because $ (3\pi^2)^2 = 9 \pi^4 $

Now combine:

- Numerator constants: $ 3 \cdot (3^3) \cdot (4 \pi)^5 \cdot A^5 \cdot m_p^5 \cdot m_e^3 \cdot G^3 $
- Denominator constants: $ 4\pi \cdot (4 \pi)^3 \cdot \hbar^6 \cdot 9 \pi^4 \cdot 3^5 \cdot Z^5 $

Wait: let's do step by step.

Numerator:

- From first fraction: 3
- From second: $ (3 m_e G)^3 = 27 m_e^3 G^3 $
- From fourth: $ (4 \pi A m_p)^5 = 4^5 \pi^5 A^5 m_p^5 $

Total numerator: $ 3 \cdot 27 \cdot 4^5 \cdot \pi^5 \cdot A^5 \cdot m_p^5 \cdot m_e^3 \cdot G^3 $

Denominator:

- From first: $ 4 \pi $
- From second: $ (4 \pi \hbar^2)^3 = 4^3 \pi^3 \hbar^6 $
- From third: $ 9 \pi^4 = 3^2 \pi^4 $
- From fourth: $ (3 Z)^5 = 3^5 Z^5 $

Total denominator: $ 4 \pi \cdot 4^3 \pi^3 \hbar^6 \cdot 3^2 \pi^4 \cdot 3^5 Z^5 = 4^4 \cdot 3^7 \cdot \pi^{1+3+4} \cdot \hbar^6 \cdot Z^5 = 4^4 \cdot 3^7 \cdot \pi^8 \cdot \hbar^6 \cdot Z^5 $

Now numerator constants:

- $ 3 \cdot 27 = 3 \cdot 3^3 = 3^4 $
- $ 4^5 $
- $ \pi^5 $

So numerator: $ 3^4 \cdot 4^5 \cdot \pi^5 \cdot A^5 m_p^5 m_e^3 G^3 $

Now divide:

- $ 3^4 / 3^7 = 1 / 3^3 = 1/27 $
- $ 4^5 / 4^4 = 4 $
- $ \pi^5 / \pi^8 = 1 / \pi^3 $

So overall:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27} \cdot \frac{A^5 m_p^5 m_e^3 G^3}{\pi^3 \hbar^6 Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

Thus, final expression:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \cdot \frac{A^5}{Z^5} \cdot \frac{m_p^5 m_e^3 G^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot M^2
}
$$

This gives the **density of a white dwarf** in terms of its mass $ M $, composition via $ A $ and $ Z $, and fundamental constants.

---

### Optional: Express in terms of mean molecular weight

Often in astrophysics, one defines $ \mu_e = A/Z $, the number of nucleons per electron. Then $ A/Z = \mu_e $, so $ A^5/Z^5 = \mu_e^5 $. So:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \cdot \mu_e^5 \cdot \frac{m_p^5 m_e^3 G^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot M^2
$$

But since the problem asks in terms of $ A $ and $ Z $, we keep $ A^5/Z^5 $.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \cdot \frac{A^5}{Z^5} \cdot \frac{m_p^5 m_e^3 G^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot M^2
}
$$

This is the density of a white dwarf supported by non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure, as a function of its total mass $ M $, nuclear mass number $ A $, atomic number $ Z $, and fundamental constants.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

- The magnetic field produced by dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at the location of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ is:
  $$
  \vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
  $$

- The potential energy of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ in an external magnetic field $ \vec{B}_1 $ is:
  $$
  U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1
  $$

So, substituting the expression for $ \vec{B}_1 $ into the energy formula:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

We can factor out the constants:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Now distribute the dot product:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Rewriting more neatly:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]
$$

This is the standard classical expression for the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles.

✅ **Final Answer**:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
$$

This formula gives the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction energy as a function of the relative orientation of the dipoles and their separation vector.

### Step 1: Forces in Circular Motion

For a circular orbit, the **centripetal force** required to keep the electron in orbit is provided by the **Coulomb attraction** between the electron and proton.

- Coulomb force magnitude:
  \[
  F_{\text{Coulomb}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
  \]
- Centripetal force required for circular motion of electron (mass \( m_e \), speed \( v \), radius \( r \)):
  \[
  F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
  \]

Equating these:
\[
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( r \):
\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\tag{1}
\]

---

### Step 2: Total Energy

The **total mechanical energy** \( E \) is the sum of kinetic energy \( K \) and potential energy \( U \):

- Kinetic energy:
  \[
  K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2
  \]
- Electrostatic potential energy (negative because it's an attractive force):
  \[
  U = -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
  \]

So total energy:
\[
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

Now use Equation (1) to eliminate \( v^2 \):

From (1): \( m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} \)

Thus:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
= -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

So the **total energy** is:
\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}}
\]

---

### Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum

Orbital angular momentum \( L \) of a point mass in circular motion is:

\[
L = m_e v r
\]

We need to express this in terms of known quantities (i.e., eliminate \( v \)).

From Equation (1):
\[
v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r}
\Rightarrow v = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
\]

Then:
\[
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
= m_e r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 m_e r} }
\]

Simplify:
\[
L = m_e r \cdot \frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0 m_e r}} 
= e \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{m_e r}{4\pi\epsilon_0} }
\]

So the **orbital angular momentum** is:
\[
\boxed{L = e \sqrt{ \frac{m_e r}{4\pi\epsilon_0} }}
\]

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy**:  
  \[
  E = -\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
  \]

- **Orbital angular momentum**:  
  \[
  L = e \sqrt{ \frac{m_e r}{4\pi\epsilon_0} }
  \]

These expressions assume a classical circular orbit under Coulomb attraction with a fixed proton (valid due to \( m_p \gg m_e \)).",0.637
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"We are given a scenario involving a meteorite colliding with a space station in circular orbit around Earth, and after the collision, they form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit with perigee (closest approach) at \( R/2 \). We're to find:

- The shape of the orbit,
- The speed of the meteorite just before impact,
- The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
- The maximum distance from Earth (apogee),
- A condition on masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) for this to be possible.

We assume:
- Earth mass = \( M \), gravitational constant = \( G \),
- Space station mass = \( m_2 \), meteorite mass = \( m_1 \),
- Initial orbit of space station: circular, radius = \( R \),
- Meteorite is **radially approaching** Earth → its velocity is purely radial (no angular momentum about Earth’s center),
- Collision is **inelastic** (they stick together),
- After collision, conglomerate (mass \( m_1 + m_2 \)) is in a **closed orbit** with perigee = \( R/2 \).

We neglect any external forces during collision (impulse approximation), so **linear momentum is conserved during the collision**, but **mechanical energy is not conserved during collision** (it's inelastic). However, **angular momentum about Earth’s center is conserved during the collision**, because the meteorite has zero angular momentum (radial motion), and the only external force (Earth's gravity) acts through the center → torque = 0.

Also, **after the collision**, the motion is governed by Earth's gravity alone → **total mechanical energy and angular momentum are conserved** for the post-collision orbit.

---

### Step 1: Understand initial conditions

**Space station:**
- Circular orbit radius = \( R \)
- Orbital speed: from centripetal force = gravity:
  \[
  \frac{m_2 v_s^2}{R} = \frac{G M m_2}{R^2} \Rightarrow v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  \]
- Direction: tangential (perpendicular to radial direction)

**Meteorite:**
- Radially falling → velocity vector points directly toward Earth center.
- Let its speed just before collision be \( v_1 \) (to be found).
- Since motion is radial, its **angular momentum about Earth’s center is zero**.

---

### Step 2: Conservation of linear momentum? Angular momentum?

Because the external gravitational force acts during the short collision time, strictly speaking, **linear momentum is NOT conserved**. However, in impulsive collision problems in orbital mechanics, we usually **neglect the impulse due to gravity during the very short collision time**, so **linear momentum is approximately conserved**.

But more robustly: **angular momentum about Earth’s center IS conserved**, because gravity exerts no torque about that point, and internal forces between meteorite and station also produce no net torque.

So better to use **conservation of angular momentum** and **conservation of linear momentum in vector form**, assuming gravity’s effect during collision is negligible.

Let’s define coordinate system:
- At collision point: position vector = \( \vec{r} = R \hat{r} \)
- Space station velocity: \( \vec{v}_s = v_s \hat{\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{\theta} \)
- Meteorite velocity: \( \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{r} \) (radially inward)

Total momentum before collision:
\[
\vec{p}_{\text{before}} = m_1 (-v_1 \hat{r}) + m_2 (v_s \hat{\theta})
\]

After collision, conglomerate (mass \( m = m_1 + m_2 \)) has velocity \( \vec{V} = V_r \hat{r} + V_\theta \hat{\theta} \)

Conservation of linear momentum (assuming instantaneous collision):
\[
(m_1 + m_2) \vec{V} = -m_1 v_1 \hat{r} + m_2 v_s \hat{\theta}
\]
So:
\[
V_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1, \quad V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_s
\]

Thus, just after collision, the conglomerate has both radial and tangential velocity components.

---

### Step 3: Post-collision orbit properties

After collision, the conglomerate moves under Earth's gravity → Keplerian orbit.

Given:
- The orbit is **closed** → it must be an **ellipse** (since energy < 0).
- Minimum distance (perigee) = \( r_{\min} = R/2 \)
- Collision occurs at \( r = R \). So the point of collision is **not** necessarily perigee or apogee — unless radial velocity is zero there, which it isn't (since \( V_r \neq 0 \) generally).

But we are told: ""the conglomerate moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2"".

So perigee = \( r_p = R/2 \)

We are to find:
- Shape: **elliptical orbit** (since closed and bound, and perigee ≠ apogee generally)
- Use conservation of **angular momentum** and **mechanical energy** for the post-collision orbit.

Let’s denote:
- \( m = m_1 + m_2 \) (mass of conglomerate; cancels out in orbital dynamics since gravity is central and mass-independent in two-body reduced problem with \( M \gg m \))
- Specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass): \( h = |\vec{r} \times \vec{V}| = R V_\theta \) (since at collision, \( \vec{r} \perp \vec{V}_\theta \), and radial component doesn’t contribute)
  \[
  h = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_s = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
  \]

- Specific mechanical energy (energy per unit mass): 
  \[
  \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}, \quad \text{where } V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2
  \]
  Compute:
  \[
  V_r^2 = \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 v_1^2, \quad V_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
  \]
  So:
  \[
  \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 v_1^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM}{R}
  \]

For an elliptical orbit, we know:
- Perigee distance: \( r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e} \)
- Apogee distance: \( r_a = \frac{h^2}{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e} \)
- Semi-major axis: \( a = -\frac{GM}{2\varepsilon} \)
- Also: \( r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e) \)
- And: \( h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2) \)

We are given \( r_p = R/2 \). Also, at the moment of collision (at \( r = R \)), the object is at some true anomaly \( \theta \), but perhaps we don’t need that.

Alternative approach: Use **conservation of angular momentum and energy between perigee and collision point**.

At perigee:
- Radial velocity = 0
- Speed = \( v_p \) (maximum speed, since closest point)
- Angular momentum: \( h = r_p v_p = (R/2) v_p \)

But we already have expression for \( h \) from collision point:
\[
h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
\]
So equate:
\[
\frac{R}{2} v_p = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} \Rightarrow v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}
\]

Similarly, at apogee (max distance \( r_a \)), speed = \( v_a \) (minimum speed), and \( h = r_a v_a \)

Also, energy is conserved:
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{v_p^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_p} = \frac{v_a^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_a}
\]

But maybe better to use known relations.

From orbital mechanics, for any Keplerian orbit:
\[
r_{\min} = \frac{h^2 / (GM)}{1 + e}, \quad r_{\max} = \frac{h^2 / (GM)}{1 - e}
\]
So:
\[
r_{\min} r_{\max} = \left( \frac{h^2}{GM} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e^2}
\]
But also, \( h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2) \), and \( a = (r_{\min} + r_{\max})/2 \)

Let’s use the formula:
\[
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)} \Rightarrow 1 + e = \frac{h^2}{GM r_p}
\]
We know \( r_p = R/2 \), and \( h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R \)

So:
\[
1 + e = \frac{ \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R }{ G M \cdot (R/2) } = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \cdot 2
\]
Thus:
\[
1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \tag{1}
\]

Since \( 0 \leq e < 1 \) for ellipse, this gives constraint:
\[
1 + e < 2 \Rightarrow \text{always true}, but also \( e \geq 0 \Rightarrow 1 + e \geq 1 \Rightarrow 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \geq 1
\Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Rightarrow m_2 \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (m_1 + m_2)
\Rightarrow m_2 (1 - 1/\sqrt{2}) \geq m_1 / \sqrt{2}
\Rightarrow m_1 \leq m_2 (\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]

We’ll come back to this as the **condition on masses**.

Now, once we have \( e \), we can find \( r_a = r_{\max} = a(1 + e) \), and since \( r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 \), then:
\[
a = \frac{R}{2(1 - e)} \Rightarrow r_a = a(1 + e) = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\]

From equation (1): \( 1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \)

Then \( 1 - e = 2 - (1 + e) = 2 - 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = 2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right] = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \)? Wait, let's compute carefully:

\[
1 - e = 2 - (1 + e) = 2 - 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = 2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right] = 2 \cdot \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}
\]

But maybe keep symbolic.

So:
\[
\frac{1 + e}{1 - e} = \frac{2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2}{2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right]} = \frac{ \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 }{ 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 } = \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2} = \frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}
\]

Therefore:
\[
r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2} \tag{2}
\]

Wait — that seems possibly less than R? But apogee should be ≥ R if collision happens between perigee and apogee. But actually, not necessarily: if the conglomerate is moving inward at collision (which it is, since meteorite adds inward radial velocity), then **collision point is between apogee and perigee**, so \( r = R > r_p = R/2 \), and could be less than or greater than \( r_a \). But since it's going inward, it must be past apogee → so \( R < r_a \) is false; actually, if it's moving inward, it must have passed apogee already, so \( R \leq r_a \). But our expression may violate that unless masses satisfy condition.

Hold on — maybe we made a mistake in direction.

Actually, after collision, radial velocity is **inward** (negative), so the object is moving **toward perigee**, meaning the current radius \( R \) is **greater than perigee**, and **less than or equal to apogee** only if it hasn't passed apogee yet. But if it's moving inward, it could be coming from apogee → so \( R \leq r_a \). So \( r_a \geq R \).

But our expression (2) gives \( r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)} \). For this to be ≥ R:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)} \geq 1 \Rightarrow m_2^2 \geq 2 m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)
\]

That seems restrictive. Maybe our assumption about where collision occurs is off.

Alternative approach: Use **energy and angular momentum** to find perigee directly, and set it equal to R/2 to solve for \( v_1 \).

Yes! That’s better.

We know after collision:
- Position: \( r = R \)
- Velocity components: \( V_r, V_\theta \) as above
- So specific angular momentum: \( h = R V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} \)
- Specific energy: \( \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}(V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{GM}{R} \)

For any Kepler orbit, the **periapsis distance** is given by:
\[
r_p = \frac{ - (GM) }{ 2 \varepsilon } \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \right)
\]
But more standard formula:
\[
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}}}
\]
Actually, eccentricity is:
\[
e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}}
\]
Then:
\[
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)}
\]

We already used that.

So let's compute \( e \) using \( \varepsilon \) and \( h \), then set \( r_p = R/2 \), and solve for \( v_1 \).

First, compute \( h^2 \):
\[
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R
\]

Compute \( \varepsilon \):
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
= \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 }{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 } + \frac{ m_2^2 GM }{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 R } - \frac{GM}{R}
\]
\[
= \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 }{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 } - \frac{GM}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2} \right)
\]

Now compute \( \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} \):

First, note:
\[
\frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} = \frac{2 h^2}{(GM)^2} \cdot \varepsilon
\]

But maybe plug into expression for \( r_p \):

\[
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)} = \frac{h^2}{GM \left(1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \right)} = \frac{R}{2}
\]

Multiply both sides by denominator:
\[
\frac{h^2}{GM} = \frac{R}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \right)
\]

But \( \frac{h^2}{GM} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R \)

So:
\[
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R = \frac{R}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \right)
\]

Cancel R:
\[
2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = 1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \tag{3}
\]

Now compute \( \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} \):

We have:
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}, \quad h = R V_\theta
\Rightarrow \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} = \frac{ (V^2 - 2GM/R) R^2 V_\theta^2 }{(GM)^2 }
\]

But maybe substitute expressions:

Recall:
\[
V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \Rightarrow V_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
\]
\[
V_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 \Rightarrow V_r^2 = \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 v_1^2
\]
So:
\[
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right)
\]

Then:
\[
2 \varepsilon = V^2 - \frac{2GM}{R} = \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 }
= \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 - [2(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2] \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 }
\]

Compute coefficient:
\[
2(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 = 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) - m_2^2 = 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + 2 m_2^2 - m_2^2 = 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2
\]

So:
\[
2 \varepsilon = \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 }
\]

Now multiply by \( h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R \):

\[
2 \varepsilon h^2 = \frac{ m_1^2 v_1^2 - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 } \cdot \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R
\]
\[
= \frac{ m_2^2 G M R }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 } \left[ m_1^2 v_1^2 - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \frac{GM}{R} \right]
\]

Divide by \( (GM)^2 \):
\[
\frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 GM } \left[ m_1^2 v_1^2 - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \frac{GM}{R} \right]
\]
\[
= \frac{ m_1^2 m_2^2 R v_1^2 }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 GM } - \frac{ m_2^2 (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 }
\]

Now go back to equation (3):
\[
2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}}
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\left[ 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1 \right]^2 = 1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}
\]

So:
\[
\frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} = \left[ 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1 \right]^2 - 1
\]

Compute RHS:
Let \( x = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \), so \( 0 < x < 1 \)

Then RHS = \( (2x^2 - 1)^2 - 1 = 4x^4 - 4x^2 + 1 - 1 = 4x^4 - 4x^2 = 4x^2(x^2 - 1) = -4x^2(1 - x^2) \)

So:
\[
\frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2} = -4 x^2 (1 - x^2) = -4 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right)
\]

But earlier, we had a long expression for the same quantity. Equate them:

\[
\frac{ m_1^2 m_2^2 R v_1^2 }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 GM } - \frac{ m_2^2 (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) }{(m_1 + m_2)^4 } = -4 \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right)
\]

Multiply both sides by \( (m_1 + m_2)^4 / m_2^2 \) (assuming \( m_2 \ne 0 \)):

\[
\frac{ m_1^2 R v_1^2 }{ GM } - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = -4 (m_1 + m_2)^2 \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right)
= -4 [ (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 ] = -4 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)
\]

So:
\[
\frac{ m_1^2 R v_1^2 }{ GM } = (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) - 4 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)
= 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 - 4 m_1^2 - 8 m_1 m_2
= -2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2
\]

Thus:
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ -2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 }{ m_1^2 }
\]

For \( v_1^2 > 0 \), numerator must be positive:
\[
m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 > 0 \Rightarrow m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
\]

Solve quadratic in \( m_2 \):
\[
m_2 = \frac{4 m_1 \pm \sqrt{16 m_1^2 + 8 m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4 m_1 \pm \sqrt{24} m_1}{2} = m_1 (2 \pm \sqrt{6})
\]

Take positive root: \( m_2 > m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6}) \approx m_1 (4.45) \)

But this contradicts earlier condition \( m_1 \leq m_2 (\sqrt{2} - 1) \approx 0.414 m_2 \Rightarrow m_2 \geq 2.414 m_1 \)

Now we have stricter: \( m_2 > 4.45 m_1 \)

But wait — sign error?

Let’s double-check algebra.

From:
\[
\frac{ m_1^2 R v_1^2 }{ GM } - (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = -4 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)
\]

Then:
\[
\frac{ m_1^2 R v_1^2 }{ GM } = (2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) - 4 m_1^2 - 8 m_1 m_2 = -2 m_1^2 -4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2
\]

Yes.

But is it possible that \( v_1^2 \) comes out positive only if \( m_2 \) is large enough? That makes sense: if meteorite is too massive, it kills the angular momentum and causes the orbit to plunge deeper than R/2 or become unbound? But here we require perigee = R/2, so maybe only possible if meteorite is not too massive.

But our result says \( v_1^2 \propto (m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2) \), which is positive only if \( m_2/m_1 > 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.45 \)

But let's sanity check with extreme cases.

Case 1: \( m_1 = 0 \) (no meteorite). Then conglomerate = space station, continues in circular orbit radius R. Perigee = R, not R/2. So to get perigee = R/2, we need to add inward radial velocity, which requires non-zero \( m_1 \). But if \( m_1 \) is very small, then post-collision orbit is slightly elliptical with perigee slightly less than R. To get perigee = R/2, need significant inward kick → so \( m_1 \) cannot be too small? Or can it, if \( v_1 \) is large?

Ah! We are to find \( v_1 \), so for any \( m_1, m_2 \), there might be a \( v_1 \) that achieves perigee = R/2. But our calculation suggests that for fixed \( m_1, m_2 \), there is a required \( v_1 \), and it must be real → so condition on masses.

But maybe we made wrong assumption about direction of meteorite velocity.

Wait: meteorite is **radially approaching**, so its velocity is toward Earth, so at collision point (r=R), its velocity is -v1 r-hat. That's correct.

But perhaps we should use **conservation of momentum** correctly.

However, there's a smarter way.

### Smarter approach: Use conservation of angular momentum and energy for the conglomerate, and use the fact that at perigee r = R/2, radial velocity = 0.

Let \( V \) be velocity of conglomerate just after collision (at r = R).

Let \( v_p \) be speed at perigee (r = R/2).

Conservation of angular momentum:
\[
(m_1 + m_2) R V_\theta = (m_1 + m_2) (R/2) v_p \Rightarrow V_\theta = \frac{v_p}{2}
\]

But also, from momentum conservation in tangential direction (meteorite has no tangential momentum):
\[
(m_1 + m_2) V_\theta = m_2 v_s = m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \Rightarrow V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]

So:
\[
v_p = 2 V_\theta = 2 \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \tag{4}
\]

Now, conservation of energy for conglomerate (specific energy conserved):
\[
\frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R}
\]

So:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} V_r^2 + \frac{1}{2} V_\theta^2 = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
\]

Multiply by 2:
\[
V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 = v_p^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R}
\]

But from (4), \( v_p = 2 V_\theta \Rightarrow v_p^2 = 4 V_\theta^2 \)

So:
\[
V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 = 4 V_\theta^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R} \Rightarrow V_r^2 = 3 V_\theta^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R}
\]

Now substitute \( V_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \)

Then:
\[
V_r^2 = 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2 GM}{R} = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 \right]
\]

But also, from linear momentum conservation in radial direction:
\[
(m_1 + m_2) V_r = - m_1 v_1 \Rightarrow V_r = - \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 \Rightarrow V_r^2 = \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 v_1^2
\]

So:
\[
\left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 \right]
\]

Multiply both sides by \( (m_1 + m_2)^2 \):
\[
m_1^2 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 \right]
= \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \right]
= \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2 \right]
= \frac{GM}{R} \left[ m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 \right]
\]

Same as before! Good.

So:
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 }{ m_1^2 } } \tag{5}
\]

For this to be real, need:
\[
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
\Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right)^2 - 4 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right) - 2 > 0
\]

Let \( x = m_2/m_1 > 0 \), then:
\[
x^2 - 4x - 2 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.449
\]

So **condition**: \( m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \)

This ensures \( v_1 \) is real and positive.

Now answer parts:

### Shape of orbit
Closed orbit with perigee ≠ apogee → **ellipse**

### (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision
From (5):
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2}{m_1^2} \right) }
= \frac{1}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2) }
\]

### (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of conglomerate

In elliptical orbit:
- Maximum speed at perigee: \( v_{\max} = v_p = 2 \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \)
- Minimum speed at apogee: use angular momentum conservation: \( v_a = \frac{h}{r_a} \), or use \( v_a = v_p \cdot \frac{r_p}{r_a} \)

But we can find \( v_a \) from energy or from relation:

From earlier, \( r_p = R/2 \), and we can find \( r_a \) from angular momentum and energy, or use:

We know specific angular momentum \( h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} \)

At apogee: \( v_a = h / r_a \)

But also, for ellipse: \( r_p + r_a = 2a \), and \( \varepsilon = -GM/(2a) \)

Compute \( \varepsilon \) from perigee:
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{v_p^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_p} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2 GM}{R} = \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 1 \right)
= - \frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 }
\]

Then semi-major axis:
\[
a = - \frac{GM}{2 \varepsilon} = \frac{GM}{2 \cdot \frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 }} = \frac{R}{4} \cdot \frac{ (m_1 + m_2)^2 }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) }
\]

Then \( r_a = 2a - r_p = 2a - R/2 = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{ (m_1 + m_2)^2 }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) } - \frac{R}{2} = \frac{R}{2} \left( \frac{ (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) } \right) \)

Compute numerator:
\[
(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 - m_1^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 = m_2^2
\]

So:
\[
r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) } \tag{6}
\]

Good, matches earlier (I had a mistake before; now it's clear).

Now, minimum speed:
\[
v_{\min} = v_a = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} }{ \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) } } = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} \cdot \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{ R m_2^2 }
= \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{ (m_1 + m_2) m_2 } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
\]

So:
- \( v_{\max} = v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \)
- \( v_{\min} = v_a = \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{ m_2 (m_1 + m_2) } \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \)

### (iii) Maximum distance from Earth

From (6):
\[
r_{\max} = r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 }{ m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) }
\]

### Condition on masses

From requirement that \( v_1^2 > 0 \), we have:
\[
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0 \Rightarrow m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1
\]

Additionally, for the orbit to be **closed** (bound), we need \( \varepsilon < 0 \), which from earlier:
\[
\varepsilon = - \frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 }{(m_1 + m_2)^2 } < 0
\]
which is always true for \( m_1, m_2 > 0 \). So only condition is from reality of \( v_1 \).

Also, note that \( r_a > r_p = R/2 \) requires \( m_2^2 > m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) \Rightarrow m_2^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 - m_1^2 > 0 \Rightarrow m_2 > m_1 (1 + \sqrt{2}) \approx 2.414 m_1 \), which is weaker than previous condition.

So final condition: \( m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \)

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that **surface brightness (or surface magnitude)** is **independent of distance** in a **non-expanding universe**, we need to understand how **flux**, **solid angle**, and **magnitude** scale with distance.

---

### Step 1: Definitions

- **Apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to its observed flux $ F $ by:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
  $$
  where $ F_0 $ is a reference flux.

- **Surface brightness** (in magnitudes per unit solid angle, e.g., $ \mathrm{mag/arcsec^2} $) is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle. Equivalently, we can define **surface brightness in linear units** as **flux per unit solid angle**, denoted $ \Sigma = \frac{dF}{d\Omega} $. Then, converting this to magnitudes gives the surface magnitude.

- **Solid angle** $ \Omega $ subtended by an object of physical area $ A $ at distance $ D $ is:
  $$
  \Omega \approx \frac{A}{D^2} \quad \text{(for small angles)}
  $$

- In a **non-expanding (Euclidean) universe**, the **inverse square law** holds: the total flux $ F $ from a source of luminosity $ L $ is:
  $$
  F = \frac{L}{4\pi D^2}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Flux per Unit Solid Angle

Suppose the galaxy has a uniform surface brightness for simplicity (the argument holds locally even if it's not uniform). Let’s consider a small patch of the galaxy with **intrinsic luminosity** $ dL $, which corresponds to a physical area $ dA $ on the galaxy.

The flux received from this patch is:
$$
dF = \frac{dL}{4\pi D^2}
$$

The solid angle this patch subtends on the sky is:
$$
d\Omega = \frac{dA}{D^2}
$$

Now compute the **surface brightness** in linear units:
$$
\Sigma = \frac{dF}{d\Omega} = \frac{dL / (4\pi D^2)}{dA / D^2} = \frac{dL}{4\pi dA}
$$

**Crucially, the $ D^2 $ cancels out!** So:
$$
\Sigma = \frac{dL}{4\pi dA} = \text{constant independent of } D
$$

This quantity depends only on the intrinsic properties of the galaxy (luminosity per unit area), **not** on how far away it is.

---

### Step 3: Convert to Magnitudes per Unit Solid Angle

Since surface brightness in linear units ($ \Sigma $) is independent of distance, then when we convert it to **magnitudes per square arcminute** (or per square arcsecond), it will also be **independent of distance**, because the magnitude is just a logarithmic transformation of flux:

$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\Sigma}{\Sigma_0} \right)
$$

where $ \Sigma_0 $ is a reference surface brightness (e.g., corresponding to zero magnitude per arcsec²).

Since $ \Sigma $ doesn’t depend on $ D $, **neither does $ \mu $**.

---

### Step 4: Intuitive Explanation

- As a galaxy moves farther away:
  - Its **total flux** decreases as $ 1/D^2 $,
  - But it also **appears smaller**: its solid angle decreases as $ 1/D^2 $,
  - So **flux per unit solid angle** stays the same.
- Therefore, **how ""bright"" each patch of the galaxy appears on the sky (per unit area)** does **not** change with distance.

This is why nearby galaxies like Andromeda can have a relatively bright total magnitude (e.g., $ m = 3.44 $) but appear faint — their light is spread over a large area, so the **surface brightness** is low (e.g., ~22 mag/arcsec²), and this surface brightness would be the same even if Andromeda were twice as far away (in a non-expanding universe).

> ⚠️ Note: In an **expanding universe** (cosmological context), surface brightness **does** decrease with redshift as $ (1+z)^{-4} $ due to cosmological effects (redshift, time dilation, angular diameter distance), but the problem specifies a **non-expanding universe**, so those effects are absent.

---

### ✅ Final Conclusion

In a non-expanding universe, **surface magnitude** (or surface brightness in mag/arcmin²) is **independent of distance**, because both flux and solid angle scale as $ 1/D^2 $, and their ratio — which determines surface brightness — remains constant.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"To derive **Kepler’s laws** from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, we begin with Newtonian mechanics and the inverse-square gravitational force. Kepler’s three empirical laws describe planetary motion, and Newton showed they follow from his laws of motion and gravitation.

We will derive each of Kepler’s laws in turn, starting from:

- **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**:  
  \[
  \vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
  \]
  where \(M\) is the mass of the Sun (assumed stationary), \(m\) is the mass of the planet, \(r\) is the distance between them, and \(\hat{r}\) is the unit vector pointing from the Sun to the planet.

- **Newton’s second law**:  
  \[
  \vec{F} = m \vec{a} = m \frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2}
  \]

We assume \(M \gg m\), so the Sun is fixed at the origin (reduced mass effects are negligible).

---

### **Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.**

**Goal**: Show that the trajectory under an inverse-square central force is a conic section (specifically, an ellipse for bound orbits).

#### Step 1: Use conservation of angular momentum
The gravitational force is **central** (\(\vec{F} \parallel \vec{r}\)), so torque \(\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0\). Therefore, **angular momentum** \(\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m \vec{v}\) is conserved.

This implies:
- Motion is confined to a plane (the orbital plane).
- Define polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) in this plane.

The magnitude of angular momentum per unit mass is:
\[
h = \frac{L}{m} = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

#### Step 2: Write radial equation of motion
From Newton’s second law in polar coordinates, the radial acceleration is:
\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

Use \(h = r^2 \dot{\theta} \Rightarrow \dot{\theta} = h / r^2\), so:
\[
\ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

This is a second-order ODE in \(r(t)\), but it's easier to change variable to \(u = 1/r\) and use \(\theta\) as independent variable.

#### Step 3: Change variable to \(u(\theta) = 1/r\)
Using the chain rule:
\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{h}{r^2} = -h \frac{du}{d\theta}
\]
\[
\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = -h \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right ) = -h \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} \cdot \dot{\theta} = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2}
\]

Substitute into radial equation:
\[
-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(-h^2 u^2\):
\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]

This is a linear second-order ODE. Its general solution is:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Choose \(\theta_0 = 0\) by rotating coordinates, so:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\]
where \(e = \frac{A h^2}{GM}\) is the **eccentricity**.

Thus,
\[
r(\theta) = \frac{1}{u(\theta)} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

This is the equation of a **conic section** with focus at the origin. For bound orbits (\(E < 0\)), \(0 \le e < 1\), so the orbit is an **ellipse**, with the Sun at one focus.

✅ **Kepler’s First Law is derived.**

---

### **Kepler’s Second Law: A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.**

This is a direct consequence of **conservation of angular momentum**.

In polar coordinates, the area swept out in time \(dt\) is:
\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\]
So the areal velocity is:
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2} h = \text{constant}
\]

Since \(h\) is constant (from conservation of angular momentum), **equal areas are swept in equal times**.

✅ **Kepler’s Second Law is derived.**

---

### **Kepler’s Third Law: The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.**

We now consider a **closed elliptical orbit** (bound case, \(e < 1\)).

From the orbit equation:
\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h^2}{GM}
\]

For an ellipse:
- Semi-latus rectum: \(p = a(1 - e^2)\)
- So: \(h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2)\)

Now compute the **orbital period** \(T\).

Total area of ellipse: \(A = \pi a b = \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}\)

But also, total area = areal velocity × period:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} h T
\]

So:
\[
\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2} = \frac{1}{2} h T
\Rightarrow T = \frac{2 \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{h}
\]

Now substitute \(h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}\):
\[
T = \frac{2 \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
\]

Thus:
\[
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{GM} a^3
\]

This shows \(T^2 \propto a^3\), with proportionality constant depending only on \(G\) and \(M\) (mass of the Sun).

✅ **Kepler’s Third Law is derived.**

---

### Summary

Starting from Newton’s law of universal gravitation and laws of motion:

1. **First Law**: Solved the orbit equation under inverse-square force → conic section; bound orbits are ellipses with Sun at focus.
2. **Second Law**: Follows directly from conservation of angular momentum → constant areal velocity.
3. **Third Law**: Used geometry of ellipse and angular momentum to relate period \(T\) and semi-major axis \(a\) → \(T^2 \propto a^3\).

Thus, **all three of Kepler’s laws are derived from Newtonian gravitation**.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise.

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=0$

According to: 

(II) If the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at the centre, then we consider Keplerian motion. $V=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\to\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}.$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"We are asked to **derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location**, i.e., $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$, in two different scenarios:

- **Case I**: Realistic rotation curve (flat or observed).
- **Case II**: Keplerian rotation (mass concentrated at center, no dark matter).

But before that, we need to **connect this gradient to Oort’s constants $A$ and $B$**.

---

### Step 1: Recall definitions of Oort constants

Oort constants $A$ and $B$ describe the local shear and vorticity of Galactic rotation. They are defined in terms of the rotational velocity $V(R)$ and its derivative at the solar radius $R_0$:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

These can be derived from the general expression for line-of-sight velocity in the solar neighborhood using a Taylor expansion of $V(R)$ around $R_0$, but here we take them as known.

Our goal is to **solve for $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$** in terms of $A$ and $B$, and then apply physical assumptions for each case to find its value.

From the above definitions, we can eliminate $V_0/R_0$:

Add the two equations:
$$
A + B = -\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)}
$$

So **in both cases**, the gradient is $-(A + B)$. But the question wants us to **derive expressions for the gradient under the two physical models**, so we must compute $A + B$ (or directly the derivative) based on the assumed form of $V(R)$.

---

### Step 2: General relation between angular velocity and rotational velocity

We have:
$$
V(R) = \Omega(R) R \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

Then:
$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

But perhaps more useful is to recall how Oort constants relate to $\Omega$:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}, \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0
$$

But we’ll stick with the $A, B$ in terms of $V(R)$ since that’s what the question asks for.

We already have:
$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)
$$

Now consider each case.

---

## Case I: Actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy

Observations show that **the rotation curve of the Milky Way is approximately flat** in the solar neighborhood, i.e.,

$$
V(R) \approx \text{constant} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dV}{dR} \approx 0 \quad \text{at } R = R_0
$$

Therefore,

$$
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \approx 0}
$$

This is the standard result: in a flat rotation curve, the rotational velocity doesn’t change with radius locally.

We can also note that if $\frac{dV}{dR} = 0$, then from the definitions:

- $A = \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
- $B = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
- So $A + B = 0$, consistent.

---

## Case II: Mass concentrated at center (Keplerian rotation)

If all mass is at the center (like a point mass), then motion follows **Kepler’s laws**:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

Compute the derivative:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( GM \right)^{1/2} R^{-1/2} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, $V_0 = \sqrt{GM/R_0}$, so:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Thus, for Case II:

$$
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}}
$$

Alternatively, in terms of Oort constants:

From earlier,
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
= \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
= -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Then $A + B = \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$, so $-(A + B) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$, consistent.

---

### Final Answers:

- **Case I (Observed flat rotation curve):**
  $$
  \boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = 0}
  $$

- **Case II (Keplerian, mass at center):**
  $$
  \boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}}
  $$

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"We are asked to **express Oort’s constants $ A $ and $ B $** in terms of:

- $ V_0 $: the rotational velocity of the Sun around the Galactic Center,
- $ R_0 $: the distance from the Sun to the Galactic Center,
- $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $: the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location.

We are given that for nearby objects ($ D \ll R_0 $), the line-of-sight and transverse velocities can be approximated as:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D.
$$

We also have the exact expressions (before approximation):

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l, \quad V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D.
$$

Our goal is to **derive expressions for $ A $ and $ B $** using a Taylor expansion of $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R = R_0 $, assuming the cloud is close to the Sun ($ D \ll R_0 $).

---

### Step 1: Geometry and Kinematics

Let’s recall some basic relations:

- The angular velocity at radius $ R $ is $ \Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R} $.
- The Sun is at $ R = R_0 $, with $ \Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0} $.
- The cloud is at distance $ D $ from the Sun, at Galactic longitude $ l $. In the Galactic plane, its Galactocentric radius $ R $ is related to $ D $ and $ l $ by the law of cosines:

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l.
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can expand $ R $ to first order in $ D $:

$$
R \approx R_0 - D \cos l.
$$

This will be useful when expanding $ \Omega(R) $ about $ R_0 $.

---

### Step 2: Expand $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R_0 $

We write:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0).
$$

Using $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $, we get:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l.
$$

Now plug this into the expression for $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l.
$$

Recall that $ \sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l $, so:

$$
V_r \approx - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l.
$$

But Oort’s formula says:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l.
$$

Therefore, comparing both expressions:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}.
\tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Express $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ V $ and $ \frac{dV}{dR} $

Since $ \Omega = \frac{V}{R} $, differentiate:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}.
$$

Evaluated at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}.
$$

Plug into equation (1):

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right).
$$

So,

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)}.
\tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 4: Derive expression for $ B $

Now consider the transverse velocity. The exact expression is:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D.
$$

Again, use the expansion:

- $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $,
- $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $ to zeroth order in $ D $ (since multiplying by $ D $, higher-order corrections would be $ \mathcal{O}(D^2) $).

So,

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D.
$$

Now, recall the trigonometric identity:

$$
\cos 2l = 2 \cos^2 l - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2}.
$$

Thus,

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right] D.
$$

Compare with Oort’s expression:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D.
$$

So, matching coefficients:

- Coefficient of $ \cos 2l $: $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ — consistent with earlier.
- Constant term: $ B = -\left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right] $.

Now substitute the expression for $ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ again:

$$
B = -\left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right) + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right]
= -\left[ \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{2 R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right]
= -\left[ \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{2 R_0} \right].
$$

Thus,

$$
\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)}.
\tag{3}
$$

### Final Answer

\boxed{

Conclude:

The process is **quasi-static**, and energy is released via **viscous dissipation**, converting orbital mechanical energy into heat/radiation.

We are told to **ignore self-gravity** of the disc (i.e., only consider gravity from central mass $ M $), and that orbits are **circular and Keplerian**.

---

### Step 1: Mechanical energy of a test mass in a circular Keplerian orbit

For a test mass $ \Delta m $ in a **circular orbit** of radius $ r $ around a mass $ M $, the **gravitational potential energy** is:

$$
U = -\frac{G M \Delta m}{r}
$$

The **kinetic energy** for a circular orbit comes from balancing gravitational force with centripetal acceleration:

$$
\frac{G M \Delta m}{r^2} = \frac{\Delta m v^2}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

So kinetic energy is:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r}
$$

Hence, the **total mechanical energy** is:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r} - \frac{G M \Delta m}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{G M \Delta m}{r}
$$

Therefore, **mechanical energy per unit mass** is:

$$
\frac{E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Energy released during inward migration

As the gas moves **inward** from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $, its mechanical energy **decreases** (becomes more negative). However, due to **viscous stresses**, the **lost mechanical energy is radiated away** (or converted to internal energy). So the **energy released** is the **difference** between initial and final mechanical energy:

$$
\Delta E = E(r) - E(R_{\text{max}}) = \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{G M \Delta m}{r} \right) - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{G M \Delta m}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} G M \Delta m \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

But this is **negative**, indicating a loss of mechanical energy. The **energy released** (i.e., **radiated or dissipated**) is the **positive** amount:

$$
|\Delta E| = \frac{1}{2} G M \Delta m \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

Now, we are told that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, so $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{1}{r} $, and we can **neglect** the $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} $ term.

Thus:

$$
|\Delta E| \approx \frac{1}{2} G M \Delta m \cdot \frac{1}{r}
$$

Therefore, the **energy released per unit mass** is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r}
$$

> ⚠️ **Important**: Note that the problem asks for ""the total mechanical energy per unit mass **released**"", which is the **positive** amount of energy radiated away, not the final mechanical energy of the gas. So we report the **magnitude of the change**, not the final energy.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r} }

$$
S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
$$

Here:
- $ s $ is the initial proper distance at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant (assumed constant in the Steady-State model),
- $ c $ is the speed of light,
- A laser is sent from Earth at time $ t = 0 $ toward a mirror initially at distance $ D $. So we identify $ s = D $.
- The light travels to the mirror, reflects, and returns to Earth, arriving at time $ t = T $.
- We are to find an expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In an expanding universe, light does **not** simply travel a fixed distance $ D $, reflect, and come back in time $ 2D/c $. Because space expands while the light is in transit, the mirror recedes during the light’s journey. Thus, the total round-trip time $ T $ will be **greater** than $ 2D/c $.

We are told that the proper distance between Earth and mirror at time $ t $ is:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

This is the **proper distance** at cosmic time $ t $, assuming the mirror and Earth are comoving (which they are, except the mirror is “fully reflecting” and has gyroscopes to keep orientation—but it’s still carried by the Hubble flow, i.e., not propelled, so its motion is purely due to expansion).

However, **light propagation in an expanding universe** must be treated carefully. But note: the problem gives us the law $ S = D e^{H_0 t} $, and asks us to use this directly—likely implying a simplified model where we can treat the recession velocity as $ v = H_0 S $, or use the exponential law to compute light travel time.

But here's a key point: In a **Steady-State Universe**, the metric is the **de Sitter universe** with scale factor:

$$
a(t) = e^{H_0 t}
$$

So proper distance between comoving points is $ S(t) = a(t) \chi = \chi e^{H_0 t} $, where $ \chi $ is the comoving distance (constant). So yes, $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ implies that at $ t=0 $, $ S(0) = D $, so comoving distance is $ \chi = D $.

Now, light follows null geodesics: $ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a^2(t) d\chi^2 = 0 $, so for radial light:

$$
\frac{d\chi}{dt} = \pm \frac{c}{a(t)} = \pm c e^{-H_0 t}
$$

We can use this to compute the light travel time.

---

### Step 2: Compute time for light to reach the mirror

Let the light be emitted at $ t = 0 $ from Earth (at $ \chi = 0 $) toward the mirror at comoving coordinate $ \chi = D $ (since $ S(0) = a(0)\chi = 1 \cdot \chi = D $).

Outbound journey: light moves from $ \chi = 0 $ to $ \chi = D $. So integrate:

$$
\int_0^{\chi=D} d\chi = \int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt
\Rightarrow D = \frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})
$$

Solve for $ t_1 $ (time to reach mirror):

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c} \\
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \\
\Rightarrow t_1 = -\frac{1}{H_0} \ln\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
$$

This assumes $ H_0 D / c < 1 $, which is reasonable for a measurable experiment.

---

### Step 3: Compute return travel time

On the return trip, light starts at $ \chi = D $ at time $ t = t_1 $, and travels back to $ \chi = 0 $, arriving at time $ t = T $. So:

$$
\int_{\chi=D}^{0} d\chi = -D = \int_{t_1}^{T} (-c e^{-H_0 t}) dt \quad \text{(since light moves toward decreasing } \chi)
$$

More cleanly:

$$
D = \int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})
$$

So:

$$
\frac{H_0 D}{c} = e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}
$$

But from earlier, we have:

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Plug into return equation:

$$
\frac{H_0 D}{c} = \left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) - e^{-H_0 T}
\Rightarrow e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Take natural log:

$$
-H_0 T = \ln\left(1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
\Rightarrow H_0 T = -\ln\left(1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
$$

This is an implicit equation for $ H_0 $. But the problem says we may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, which suggests that $ H_0 D / c \ll 1 $, i.e., the distance is small compared to the Hubble distance $ c/H_0 $. This is realistic (e.g., even for D = 1 Mpc, H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc → H₀D/c ≈ 0.00023).

So we can **linearize**.

---

### Step 4: Use approximation for small $ H_0 $

We go back to the exact relation:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now, since $ H_0 T \ll 1 $ (because T ≈ 2D/c, and H₀D/c ≪ 1 ⇒ H₀T ≈ 2H₀D/c ≪ 1), we can expand left-hand side:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T
$$

So:

$$
1 - H_0 T \approx 1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Cancel 1:

$$
- H_0 T \approx - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ -H_0 $:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Wait—that gives no information about $ H_0 $! That’s because to **first order**, the expansion effect cancels out in this approximation? But that can’t be—there must be a **second-order** effect.

Ah! Important realization: If we only keep first-order terms, the correction to the round-trip time due to expansion is **second order** in $ H_0 D / c $. So to extract $ H_0 $, we need to go to **next order** in the expansion.

Let’s do a more careful expansion **without canceling too early**.

---

### Step 5: Alternative approach – track photon path with moving mirror

Maybe the problem expects a **simpler Newtonian-like treatment**, using the given law $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ as the instantaneous distance, and assuming light moves at speed $ c $ relative to local space, but the mirror is receding.

In many introductory treatments, for small distances, one approximates that during the light’s travel, the mirror moves with velocity $ v = H_0 D $, but actually velocity changes as distance increases.

But perhaps the problem wants us to consider:

- At time $ t $, distance is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $
- Light going out: it must cover increasing distance.
- However, the problem may allow us to approximate the **total path length** as integral of $ c dt = d(\text{distance}) + H_0 \cdot \text{distance} \cdot dt $, but that’s vague.

Alternatively, use the fact that in a de Sitter universe, the **round-trip light travel time** for a comoving mirror at initial proper distance $ D $ is given by the relation we derived:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now, instead of expanding both sides to first order, let's solve for $ H_0 $ **approximately** by expanding to **second order**.

Let $ \epsilon = H_0 D / c \ll 1 $. Then the equation becomes:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - 2\epsilon
$$

Also, note that **if there were no expansion**, the round-trip time would be $ T_0 = 2D/c $. So define:

$$
T = \frac{2D}{c} + \Delta T
$$

We expect $ \Delta T \propto H_0 $.

Now expand both sides to second order in $ \epsilon $.

Left side: $ e^{-H_0 T} = e^{-H_0 (2D/c + \Delta T)} = e^{-2\epsilon - H_0 \Delta T} $

Since $ \epsilon \ll 1 $, and we anticipate $ \Delta T \sim H_0 D^2 / c^2 $, so $ H_0 \Delta T \sim \epsilon^2 $, so exponent is $ -2\epsilon + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2) $

Thus:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - 2\epsilon + 2\epsilon^2 - H_0 \Delta T + \cdots
$$

Right side: $ 1 - 2\epsilon $

Equate:

$$
1 - 2\epsilon + 2\epsilon^2 - H_0 \Delta T \approx 1 - 2\epsilon
\Rightarrow 2\epsilon^2 - H_0 \Delta T \approx 0
\Rightarrow \Delta T \approx \frac{2\epsilon^2}{H_0} = \frac{2}{H_0} \left( \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)^2 = \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

So total time:

$$
T = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Now **solve for $ H_0 $**:

$$
T - \frac{2D}{c} = \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
$$

This is a **first-order measurable expression**: the excess time beyond $ 2D/c $ is proportional to $ H_0 $.

But wait—does this match with a direct calculation?

Let’s verify using a **simpler method**: assume that during the light’s travel, the distance changes slowly, so we can use a **first-order perturbation**.

---

### Step 6: First-order perturbative calculation (more intuitive)

Let the mirror be at distance $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \approx D (1 + H_0 t) $ for small $ H_0 t $.

**Outbound trip**: light leaves at $ t=0 $, arrives at mirror at time $ t_1 $. During this time, light travels distance equal to the integral of $ c dt $, but must catch up to a receding mirror.

At any instant, the rate of change of distance between light and mirror is $ c - v(t) $, but better: the position of the light front is $ x_\text{light}(t) = c t $ (if we ignore expansion of space and just treat mirror moving in flat space with velocity due to Hubble law). This is a **Newtonian approximation**, valid for small distances.

Mirror’s position: $ x_m(t) = D + \int_0^t v(t') dt' $, and since $ v(t) = H_0 x_m(t) $, but if $ H_0 t \ll 1 $, then $ x_m(t) \approx D (1 + H_0 t) $, so velocity ≈ $ H_0 D $.

So approximately, mirror moves with constant velocity $ v = H_0 D $.

Then, outbound: light catches mirror when:

$$
c t_1 = D + H_0 D t_1 \Rightarrow t_1 (c - H_0 D) = D \Rightarrow t_1 = \frac{D}{c - H_0 D} \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
$$

Return trip: now mirror reflects light, and Earth is ""receding"" from the light? Wait—in this frame, Earth is at rest, mirror was moving away. After reflection, light travels back toward Earth at speed $ c $, but during return time $ t_2 $, the light must cover the distance the mirror was at at time $ t_1 $, which is $ D + H_0 D t_1 \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $. But Earth is not moving in this frame (we’re in Solar System rest frame), so return distance is just that separation, and light covers it at speed $ c $, so:

$$
t_2 = \frac{D (1 + H_0 t_1)}{c} \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + H_0 t_1)
$$

Now plug $ t_1 \approx D/c (1 + H_0 D / c) $:

$$
t_2 \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + H_0 \cdot \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) \right) \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) \quad \text{(drop } H_0^2 \text{)}
$$

So total time:

$$
T = t_1 + t_2 \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) + \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) = \frac{2D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
$$

Thus:

$$
T = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Same result as before!

Therefore, solving for $ H_0 $:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
$$

This is the desired expression, **to first order in $ H_0 D / c $**.

We can also write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} \left( \frac{c T}{2D} - 1 \right) \cdot 2? Wait, better to leave as above.

Alternatively:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} \left( \frac{c T}{2D} - 1 \right) \cdot \frac{2c}{2D}? No.

Stick with:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}
$$

This is the expression for the Hubble constant in terms of measured round-trip time $ T $, known distance $ D $, and speed of light $ c $, under the assumption that $ H_0 D / c \ll 1 $, so that first-order expansion is valid.

### Final Check: Dimensional analysis

- $ T $: time
- $ D $: length
- $ c $: length/time

So $ T - 2D/c $: time

$ c^2 / D^2 $: (L²/T²) / L² = 1/T²

Multiply: (1/T²) × T = 1/T → correct dimension for $ H_0 $.

26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"We are asked to find the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{GW} $ of a binary neutron star system consisting of two identical masses $ M $, orbiting each other in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ (around their center of mass). The system is approximated as Newtonian but radiates energy via gravitational waves according to general relativity.

We are told:

- The formula involves only a dimensionless constant (given as $ \frac{2}{5} $), and the physical constants $ G $, $ c $, and the parameters $ M $ and $ R $.
- The powers of $ c $ and $ R $ in the expression are the same (i.e., if $ R $ appears as $ R^n $, then $ c $ appears as $ c^n $).
- We are to use dimensional analysis along with the given information to construct $ L_{GW} $.

---

### Step 1: Understand what luminosity means dimensionally

Luminosity $ L_{GW} $ is power, i.e., energy per unit time. So its dimensions are:

$$
[L_{GW}] = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{M L^2}{T^3}
$$

In terms of fundamental dimensions (mass $M$, length $L$, time $T$):

$$
[L_{GW}] = M L^2 T^{-3}
$$

---

### Step 2: List dimensions of relevant quantities

- Gravitational constant: $ [G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} $
- Speed of light: $ [c] = L T^{-1} $
- Mass: $ [M] = M $
- Radius: $ [R] = L $

We are to build an expression of the form:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^d \cdot R^e
$$

with the constraint that **the exponents of $ c $ and $ R $ are equal**, so:

$$
b = e
$$

Our goal is to find integers (or rational numbers) $ a, b, d, e $ such that the dimensions match $ M L^2 T^{-3} $.

---

### Step 3: Write total dimensions of RHS

Compute dimensions of RHS:

- $ [G^a] = M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a} $
- $ [c^b] = L^b T^{-b} $
- $ [M^d] = M^d $
- $ [R^e] = L^e $, and since $ b = e $, we can write $ R^b $

So total dimensions:

$$
[M]: -a + d \\
[L]: 3a + b + b = 3a + 2b \\
[T]: -2a - b
$$

Set equal to dimensions of luminosity $ M^1 L^2 T^{-3} $:

$$
\begin{cases}
-a + d = 1 \quad \text{(mass)} \\
3a + 2b = 2 \quad \text{(length)} \\
-2a - b = -3 \quad \text{(time)}
\end{ cases}
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve the system

From the time equation:

$$
-2a - b = -3 \Rightarrow 2a + b = 3 \quad \text{(1)}
$$

From the length equation:

$$
3a + 2b = 2 \quad \text{(2)}
$$

Solve equations (1) and (2):

From (1): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Plug into (2):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
(-a) + 6 = 2 \\
-a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Then $ b = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 $

So:

- $ a = 4 $
- $ b = -5 $
- $ e = b = -5 $
- From mass equation: $ -a + d = 1 \Rightarrow -4 + d = 1 \Rightarrow d = 5 $

---

### Step 5: Write the expression

So,

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Or more neatly:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But wait! Let’s double-check this against known results.

---

### Step 6: Compare with known quadrupole formula

The standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary with masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $, separation $ a $ (distance between the two bodies), is:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

In our case, $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, so:

- $ m_1^2 m_2^2 = M^4 $
- $ m_1 + m_2 = 2M $
- So numerator: $ M^4 \cdot 2M = 2 M^5 $
- Separation between stars is **not** $ R $, but **$ 2R $**!

Because the problem states: “two identical neutron stars of mass $ M $ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass.” So each star orbits at distance $ R $ from the center of mass, so the separation between them is:

$$
a = 2R
$$

Therefore, the standard formula gives:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \cdot \frac{2 M^5}{(2R)^5} = \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Exactly matches our derived expression!

✅ So the interpretation of $ R $ as the orbital radius of each star (not the separation) is consistent, and the result is correct.

$$

Our goal is to find an expression for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, the rate at which the orbital separation (more precisely, the orbital radius of each star around the center of mass) decreases due to this energy loss.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total mechanical energy of the system

In a Newtonian circular binary system, the total mechanical energy $ E $ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For two masses $ M $ and $ M $, separated by a distance $ a = 2R $ (since each orbits at radius $ R $ from the center of mass), the standard result for total energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a} = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

> **Note**: In general, for two bodies in circular orbit, total energy is $ E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a} $, where $ a $ is the separation between them. Here, since both masses are equal to $ M $, and each orbits at radius $ R $, the separation is $ 2R $. So yes, $ a = 2R $, and hence:
$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

So the total orbital energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate energy loss to change in radius

The system loses energy via gravitational radiation, so the rate of change of orbital energy is:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

(The negative sign indicates that the system is losing energy, so $ dE/dt < 0 $, while $ L_{\text{GW}} > 0 $.)

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using the chain rule:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

But we also have:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

Equating the two expressions:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $

Multiply both sides by $ \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
$$

Simplify:

- $ G^4 / G = G^3 $
- $ M^5 / M^2 = M^3 $
- $ R^2 / R^5 = 1 / R^3 $
- Numerical factor: $ 2 \cdot 4 = 8 $

So:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}
