1,"The angular resolution of the human eye is 14/0.6 = 23”, while that of a 2.16-meter telescope is 14/216 = 0.06”. Based on these data, the human eye can distinguish details separated by 10 cm at a distance of 0.9 km, whereas the 2.16-meter telescope can extend this capability to more than 300 km. However, this is an ideal situation considering only the diffraction limit. In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability. In astronomy, the degradation of stellar image quality and resolution caused by atmospheric turbulence and scattering is called *seeing*, and the size of the seeing disk is used to evaluate the atmospheric optical quality at a telescope site. Even at observatory sites with excellent seeing, the seeing disk can still reach about 1”. In modern cities, sky light pollution is severe: not only is the resolution extremely poor, but even the basic “ability to see” is greatly diminished. People who have never left large cities have never seen the magnificent sight of a star-studded sky, nor have they appreciated the beauty of the bright Milky Way. Lacking direct experience inevitably weakens one’s affection for nature and spirit of exploration. <image>JSTL-Fig-1</image> As shown in the figure, some computed data under the assumption of exceptionally good atmospheric conditions are listed. Now, based on the limiting magnitude *m*, where a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, calculate the distance *r* at which a “single candle flame” can be seen.","Step 1: The limiting magnitude is the magnitude of the faintest celestial object that can be seen. Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

Get: 

$r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}}}$ meters  
$= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54}} \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers  
$= 0.6275 \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers.

Here *m* is the limiting magnitude. For the human eye, *m = 6.5*, so $r = 0.6275 \times 10^{1.3}$ kilometers $= 12.5$ kilometers.

Final_answer: $\boxed{r = 12.5 km}$",r = 12.5 km,Yes,"{
  ""solution"": ""The problem asks us to calculate the distance *r* at which a \""single candle flame\"" can be seen, given the limiting magnitude *m* and the formula for illumination: \n\n$$ E_L = 2.54 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-0.4m} \\text{ lux} $$\n\nWe are told that this formula relates the limiting magnitude *m* to the illumination *E_L* (in lux) produced by a star of that magnitude. The question is asking for the distance *r* at which a single candle flame can be seen — i.e., when its apparent brightness equals the threshold sensitivity of the observer (defined by their limiting magnitude).\n\nIn the table provided, we have data for different observers (human eye, telescopes) including:\n- Their limiting magnitude *m*\n- The distance at which they can see a candle flame (in km)\n\nFor example, for the human eye (6 mm aperture), *m* = 6.5, and the candle flame is visible at 12 km.\n\nSo, we need to relate the illumination from a candle flame at distance *r* to the limiting illumination *E_L* corresponding to the limiting magnitude *m*.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the physical meaning\n\nA candle flame emits light. At distance *r*, the illumination (illuminance) on a surface perpendicular to the light rays is inversely proportional to the square of the distance:\n\n$$ E = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n\nwhere *L* is the luminous flux (in lumens) of the source.\n\nBut in the context of astronomy, the formula given is for stellar illumination based on magnitude. We must assume that the candle flame is being treated as a point source with a known luminous intensity or flux, and we are to find the distance *r* at which its illuminance equals the threshold *E_L* corresponding to the limiting magnitude *m*.\n\nHowever, the problem does not give the luminous flux of the candle directly. Instead, it gives us the distance at which the human eye can see the candle flame (12 km) and the corresponding limiting magnitude (6.5). So we can use this as a reference to calibrate the candle's luminous flux.\n\n### Step 2: Use the human eye data to find the candle’s luminous flux\n\nLet *L* be the luminous flux (in lumens) of the candle flame.\n\nAt distance *r* = 12 km = 12,000 m, the illuminance is:\n\n$$ E = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n\nThis illuminance must equal the threshold illuminance *E_L* corresponding to *m* = 6.5:\n\n$$ E_L = 2.54 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-0.4 \\times 6.5} $$\n\nCalculate *E_L*:\n\nFirst, compute exponent: -0.4 × 6.5 = -2.6\n\nThen, 10^{-2.6} = 10^{-2} × 10^{-0.6} ≈ 0.01 × 0.2512 = 0.002512\n\nSo,\n\n$$ E_L = 2.54 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 0.002512 \\approx 6.38 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ lux} $$\n\nNow set equal to illuminance from candle:\n\n$$ \\frac{L}{4\\pi (12000)^2} = 6.38 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(12000)^2 = 144,000,000 = 1.44 × 10^8\n\n4π × 1.44 × 10^8 ≈ 12.566 × 1.44 × 10^8 ≈ 18.096 × 10^8 = 1.8096 × 10^9\n\nSo,\n\n$$ L = 6.38 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 1.8096 \\times 10^9 \\approx 11.55 \\text{ lumens} $$\n\nThus, we estimate that a candle flame emits approximately **11.55 lumens**.\n\n### Step 3: General formula for distance *r* for any limiting magnitude *m*\n\nNow, for a general limiting magnitude *m*, the threshold illuminance is:\n\n$$ E_L(m) = 2.54 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-0.4m} $$\n\nSet equal to candle illuminance:\n\n$$ \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} = E_L(m) $$\n\nSolve for *r*:\n\n$$ r^2 = \\frac{L}{4\\pi E_L(m)} $$\n\n$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4\\pi E_L(m)}} $$\n\nSubstitute *L* = 11.55 lumens and *E_L(m)*:\n\n$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{11.55}{4\\pi \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-0.4m}}} $$\n\nWe can simplify constants:\n\nDenominator constant: 4π × 2.54 × 10^{-6} ≈ 12.566 × 2.54 × 10^{-6} ≈ 31.90 × 10^{-6} = 3.190 × 10^{-5}\n\nSo,\n\n$$ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{11.55}{3.190 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^{-0.4m}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{11.55}{3.190 \\times 10^{-5}} \\times 10^{0.4m}} $$\n\nCompute constant:\n\n11.55 / 3.190e-5 ≈ 362,070.5 → 3.6207 × 10^5\n\nSo,\n\n$$ r = \\sqrt{3.6207 \\times 10^5 \\times 10^{0.4m}} = \\sqrt{3.6207 \\times 10^5} \\times 10^{0.2m} $$\n\n√(3.6207 × 10^5) = √3.6207 × √10^5 ≈ 1.903 × 316.23 ≈ 601.5\n\nSo,\n\n$$ r \\approx 601.5 \\times 10^{0.2m} \\text{ meters} $$\n\nConvert to kilometers: divide by 1000\n\n$$ r \\approx 0.6015 \\times 10^{0.2m} \\text{ km} $$\n\n### Step 4: Verify with human eye data\n\nFor *m* = 6.5:\n\n10^{0.2×6.5} = 10^{1.3} ≈ 20\n\nr ≈ 0.6015 × 20 = 12.03 km → matches table value (12 km). ✅\n\n### Final Formula\n\nTherefore, the distance *r* (in kilometers) at which a single candle flame can be seen, given limiting magnitude *m*, is:\n\n$$ \\boxed{r = 0.6015 \\times 10^{0.2m}} $$\n\nThis is the derived formula.\n\nNote: The problem says \""calculate the distance *r*\"", but doesn't specify a particular *m*. Since the table gives values for different *m*, and the question is general, we provide the formula as the answer. If a specific *m* were requested, we could plug it in. But since none is specified, we give the general expression.\n\nAlternatively, if the question expects the derivation process and then a final formula, we present that.\n\n"",

2,"<image>JSTL-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, David is researching an Earth-like exoplanet near the constellation of Bootes, orbiting a star twice the mass of our Sun. On March 14, 2025, the planet was observed at 3 AU from its parent star. After some time, David observes it again and finds that it has already passed its farthest point from the star and is now at 4 AU. If the planet is known to have a period of 5 years and an eccentricity of 0.5, what is the shortest amount of time that could have passed since the first observation on March 14, 2025? Assume that David views the orbit face-on and that the exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points.","Step1: First, we need to find the planet’s semi-major axis through the Kepler’s third law.

Get:

$\frac{a^3}{T^2} = M$

$a = \sqrt[3]{MT^2} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 5^2} \approx 3.684 \text{ AU}$

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

Get: 

$r=\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos f}$

$\cos f=\frac{1}{e}\left(\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{r}-1\right)$

$f_{3}\text{ AU }=99^{\circ}5^{\prime}27^{\prime\prime}$

$f_{4}\text{ AU }=231^{\circ}47^{\prime}36^{\prime\prime}$

Step3: From the true anomaly, we must convert it to eccentric anomaly. Similar to before, the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ and the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between 180° and 360°.

Get:

$\cos E = \frac{e + \cos f}{1 + e \cos f}$

$E_{3 \text{ AU}} = 68^\circ 12^{\prime} 7.2^{\prime\prime}$

$E_{4 \text{ AU}} = 260^\circ 7^{\prime} 18.9^{\prime\prime}$

Step4: From the eccentric anomaly, we must convert it to mean anomaly. Similar to before, the mean anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between 0 and $\pi$ and the mean anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between π and 2π. (The calculation below is in radians)

Get:

$M = E - e \sin E$

$M_{3 \text{ AU}} = 0.7261 \text{ rad}$

$M_{4 \text{ AU}} = 5.0326 \text{ rad}$

Step5: From the mean anomaly, we can find the elapsed time since March 14, 2025.

Get:

$M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \times (t - t_0)$

$\Delta M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$

$\Delta t = \Delta M \times \frac{T}{2\pi} = (M_{4 \text{ AU}} - M_{3 \text{ AU}}) \times \frac{5 \text{ yrs}}{2\pi}$

$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$

Final_answer:  $\boxed{\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}}$",$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$,Yes,"{
  ""solution"": ""We are given an exoplanet orbiting a star of mass 2 solar masses (M = 2 M☉), with orbital period P = 5 years, eccentricity e = 0.5, and observed at two points: first at 3 AU, then later at 4 AU, after having passed its farthest point (aphelion). We are to find the shortest possible time that could have elapsed between these observations.\n\nStep 1: Understand the orbit geometry.\n\nThe planet’s orbit is elliptical with eccentricity e = 0.5. The semimajor axis 'a' can be found from Kepler’s Third Law:\n\nP² = (4π² / G(M + m)) * a³\n\nBut since the planet’s mass is negligible compared to the star (Earth-like), we can approximate:\n\nP² = (4π² / GM) * a³\n\nUsing astronomical units (AU), years, and solar masses, the simplified form is:\n\nP² = a³ / M_star_in_solar_masses\n\nWait — actually, in standard astronomical units, Kepler’s Third Law for orbits around the Sun is P² = a³. For a star of mass M (in solar masses), it becomes:\n\nP² = a³ / M\n\nSo:\n\n(5)² = a³ / 2 → 25 = a³ / 2 → a³ = 50 → a = ∛50 ≈ 3.684 AU\n\nSo the semimajor axis is approximately 3.684 AU.\n\nStep 2: Find the distances at perihelion and aphelion.\n\nFor an ellipse:\n\nPerihelion distance r_peri = a(1 - e)\nAphelion distance r_aphe = a(1 + e)\n\nSo:\n\nr_peri = 3.684 * (1 - 0.5) = 3.684 * 0.5 = 1.842 AU\nr_aphe = 3.684 * (1 + 0.5) = 3.684 * 1.5 = 5.526 AU\n\nBut the problem says the planet was observed at 3 AU and then later at 4 AU, both of which lie between perihelion and aphelion. Also, it says that after the first observation, the planet has passed aphelion and is now at 4 AU. That suggests the planet was moving from perihelion toward aphelion during the first part of the orbit, reached aphelion, and then moved back toward perihelion, reaching 4 AU on the return leg.\n\nWait — but 4 AU is less than aphelion (5.526 AU), so yes, it's possible. But note: the first observation was at 3 AU, and then later at 4 AU, after passing aphelion. So the planet went from 3 AU → aphelion → 4 AU.\n\nThat means the first observation was before aphelion (on the way out), and the second was after aphelion (on the way back in).\n\nAlso, the problem states: \""the exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points.\"" This confirms that at the first point (3 AU), the planet is moving away from the star (positive radial velocity), and at the second point (4 AU), it is moving toward the star (negative radial velocity), consistent with having passed aphelion.\n\nStep 3: Use true anomaly to compute time between positions.\n\nIn orbital mechanics, the position of a body in an elliptical orbit is described by the true anomaly ν (angle from perihelion). The radial distance r is related to ν by:\n\nr = a(1 - e²)/(1 + e cosν)\n\nWe can solve for ν at each observation point.\n\nFirst observation: r₁ = 3 AU\n\n3 = 3.684 * (1 - 0.25) / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁) = 3.684 * 0.75 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁) = 2.763 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁)\n\nSo:\n\n1 + 0.5 cosν₁ = 2.763 / 3 = 0.921\n→ 0.5 cosν₁ = 0.921 - 1 = -0.079\n→ cosν₁ = -0.158\n→ ν₁ = arccos(-0.158) ≈ 100.0° or 260.0°\n\nBut since the planet is moving away from the star (radial velocity positive), it must be between perihelion and aphelion, so ν₁ is between 0° and 180°. Thus, ν₁ ≈ 100.0°.\n\nSecond observation: r₂ = 4 AU\n\n4 = 2.763 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₂)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν₂ = 2.763 / 4 = 0.69075\n→ 0.5 cosν₂ = -0.30925\n→ cosν₂ = -0.6185\n→ ν₂ = arccos(-0.6185) ≈ 128.2° or 231.8°\n\nBut since the planet has passed aphelion (which is at ν = 180°), and is moving inward, ν₂ must be between 180° and 360°. So ν₂ ≈ 231.8°.\n\nThus, the planet moves from ν₁ ≈ 100.0° to ν₂ ≈ 231.8°.\n\nThe angular displacement is Δν = 231.8° - 100.0° = 131.8°.\n\nBut wait — this is not the central angle swept; in orbital motion, we need to use the mean anomaly and Kepler’s equation to find the time elapsed.\n\nStep 4: Convert true anomaly to eccentric anomaly and then to mean anomaly.\n\nWe use the relationships:\n\ncos E = (cos ν + e) / (1 + e cos ν)\n\nand\n\nM = E - e sin E\n\nThen time t = (M / 2π) * P\n\nWe’ll compute E₁ and E₂ from ν₁ and ν₂, then M₁ and M₂, then Δt = (ΔM / 2π) * P.\n\nFirst, for ν₁ ≈ 100.0°:\n\ncosν₁ = cos(100°) ≈ -0.1736 (earlier we had -0.158 from calculation — let’s use exact value from r=3)\n\nActually, better to use exact values from the distance formula.\n\nRecall:\n\nr = a(1 - e²)/(1 + e cosν)\n\nWe solved:\n\nFor r = 3:\n\n3 = 3.684 * (1 - 0.25) / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁) = 2.763 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν₁ = 2.763 / 3 = 0.921\n→ cosν₁ = (0.921 - 1)/0.5 = -0.158\n→ ν₁ = arccos(-0.158) = 100.0° (since in [0,180])\n\nSimilarly, for r = 4:\n\n4 = 2.763 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₂)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν₂ = 2.763 / 4 = 0.69075\n→ cosν₂ = (0.69075 - 1)/0.5 = -0.6185\n→ ν₂ = arccos(-0.6185) = 128.2° (but this is before aphelion! Wait — contradiction.)\n\nAh! Here’s the issue. If the planet is at 4 AU and has passed aphelion, then ν should be > 180°. But arccos(-0.6185) gives 128.2°, which is < 180°. So we must take the other solution: ν₂ = 360° - 128.2° = 231.8°, as I said earlier.\n\nSo ν₁ = 100.0°, ν₂ = 231.8°.\n\nNow compute eccentric anomaly E for each.\n\nFormula:\n\ncos E = (cos ν + e) / (1 + e cos ν)\n\nFor ν₁ = 100.0°, cosν₁ = -0.158, e = 0.5\n\ncos E₁ = (-0.158 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.5*(-0.158)) = 0.342 / (1 - 0.079) = 0.342 / 0.921 ≈ 0.3713\n→ E₁ = arccos(0.3713) ≈ 68.2°\n\nFor ν₂ = 231.8°, cosν₂ = cos(231.8°) = cos(180°+51.8°) = -cos(51.8°) ≈ -0.6185 (as before)\n\ncos E₂ = (-0.6185 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.5*(-0.6185)) = (-0.1185) / (1 - 0.30925) = -0.1185 / 0.69075 ≈ -0.1715\n→ E₂ = arccos(-0.1715) ≈ 100.0° (but since ν > 180°, E should also be > 180°? No — eccentric anomaly ranges from 0 to 360°, but arccos gives 0 to 180°. Since cos E₂ is negative, E₂ is in second quadrant, so E₂ ≈ 180° - arccos(0.1715) ≈ 180° - 80.2° = 99.8°? Wait no:\n\narccos(-0.1715) = 180° - arccos(0.1715) ≈ 180° - 80.2° = 99.8° — but that’s still less than 180°. However, for ν > 180°, E should be > 180°? Let me check.\n\nActually, when ν > 180°, E can be in the range (180°, 360°), but arccos only gives [0,180]. So we need to adjust.\n\nBetter to use the identity:\n\ntan(E/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) * tan(ν/2)\n\nLet’s use this formula for more accuracy.\n\nFirst, for ν₁ = 100.0°:\n\ntan(ν₁/2) = tan(50.0°) ≈ 1.1918\n\nsqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) = sqrt(1.5 / 0.5) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\n\ntan(E₁/2) = 1.732 * 1.1918 ≈ 2.064\n→ E₁/2 = arctan(2.064) ≈ 64.2°\n→ E₁ ≈ 128.4°\n\nWait — this contradicts previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me recalculate using cos E formula carefully.\n\nFor ν₁ = 100.0°, cosν₁ = cos(100°) = -cos(80°) ≈ -0.1736\nEarlier we used -0.158 from the r=3 equation, but let's be precise.\n\nFrom r = a(1-e²)/(1+e cosν)\n\nWe have r = 3, a = ∛50 ≈ 3.684, e=0.5, so 1-e² = 0.75\n\nSo 3 = 3.684 * 0.75 / (1 + 0.5 cosν)\n→ 3 = 2.763 / (1 + 0.5 cosν)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν = 2.763 / 3 = 0.921\n→ 0.5 cosν = -0.079\n→ cosν = -0.158\nSo cosν₁ = -0.158\n\nNow cos E₁ = (cosν₁ + e) / (1 + e cosν₁) = (-0.158 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.5*(-0.158)) = 0.342 / (1 - 0.079) = 0.342 / 0.921 = 0.3713\nE₁ = arccos(0.3713) = 68.2°\n\nBut according to tan formula, we got 128.4°. Why discrepancy?\n\nBecause the tan formula requires care with quadrant. When ν = 100°, which is in second quadrant, E should be in second quadrant too? Let's see.\n\nActually, the formula tan(E/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) * tan(ν/2) is valid for ν in (0, π), and gives E in (0, π) for those cases. But for ν > π, we need to handle separately.\n\nFor ν₁ = 100° < 180°, so E₁ should be between 0 and 180°, and arccos gave us 68.2°, which is fine.\n\nNow for ν₂ = 231.8° > 180°, so we need to use the formula for ν > 180°.\n\nSince the orbit is symmetric, we can consider the equivalent point on the other side.\n\nNote that the distance at ν and at 360°-ν are the same, because cos(360°-ν) = cosν. But the velocity direction changes.\n\nHowever, in this case, for ν = 231.8°, which is in third quadrant, we can use:\n\ntan(E/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) * tan(ν/2)\n\nν₂ = 231.8°, so ν₂/2 = 115.9°, tan(115.9°) = tan(180° - 64.1°) = -tan(64.1°) ≈ -2.064\n\nsqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\n\ntan(E₂/2) = 1.732 * (-2.064) = -3.576\n→ E₂/2 = arctan(-3.576) ≈ -74.2°\n→ E₂ = -148.4°, which is equivalent to 360° - 148.4° = 211.6°\n\nAlternatively, since tan is periodic, we can add 180°: E₂/2 = 180° - 74.2° = 105.8°, so E₂ = 211.6°\n\nYes, so E₂ ≈ 211.6°\n\nNow compute mean anomaly M = E - e sin E\n\nFor E₁ = 68.2°\n\nsin E₁ = sin(68.2°) ≈ 0.929\nM₁ = 68.2° - 0.5 * 0.929 = 68.2° - 0.4645 = 67.7355°\n\nFor E₂ = 211.6°\n\nsin E₂ = sin(211.6°) = sin(180°+31.6°) = -sin(31.6°) ≈ -0.524\nM₂ = 211.6° - 0.5 * (-0.524) = 211.6° + 0.262 = 211.862°\n\nNow, the difference in mean anomaly: ΔM = M₂ - M₁ = 211.862° - 67.7355° = 144.1265°\n\nConvert to fraction of orbit: 144.1265° / 360° = 0.40035\n\nTime elapsed: Δt = 0.40035 * P = 0.40035 * 5 = 2.00175 years\n\nBut the problem asks for the shortest amount of time. Is there a shorter path? For example, if the planet goes the other way around the orbit?\n\nThe planet could have gone from ν₁ = 100° to ν₂ = 231.8° clockwise, which is what we did, or counterclockwise — but since it's moving away then coming back, and we're told it passed aphelion, it must go through aphelion, so the short arc would be direct, but in terms of time, the orbit is symmetric, but going the long way around would take longer.\n\nThe total orbit is 360°, so the other way would be 360° - 131.8° = 228.2°, which would take more time.\n\nSo the shortest time is indeed the direct path through aphelion, which we calculated as ~2.00175 years.\n\nBut let's confirm the values.\n\nWe can also compute the time from perihelion.\n\nAt perihelion, ν=0°, E=0°, M=0°.\n\nTime from perihelion to ν₁ = 100° is t₁ = (M₁ / 360) * P = (67.7355 / 360) * 5 ≈ 0.18815 * 5 = 0.94075 years\n\nTime from perihelion to ν₂ = 231.8° is t₂ = (211.862 / 360) * 5 ≈ 0.5885 * 5 = 2.9425 years\n\nBut wait — this is inconsistent because ν₂ = 231.8° is after aphelion, so it should be after half orbit.\n\nAphelion is at ν=180°, M = ? At ν=180°, cosν=-1, so\n\ncos E = (-1 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*(-1)) = (-0.5)/(0.5) = -1 → E=180°\nM = 180° - 0.5*sin(180°) = 180°\nSo at aphelion, M=180°, which is half period, 2.5 years.\n\nOur M₂ = 211.862° > 180°, so t₂ = (211.862/360)*5 ≈ 2.9425 years, which is after aphelion, good.\n\nM₁ = 67.7355°, t₁ = 0.94075 years\n\nSo time between observations: Δt = t₂ - t₁ = 2.9425 - 0.94075 = 2.00175 years\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut is this the shortest? Could the planet have been observed at the same positions but on a different revolution? No, because the second observation is after passing aphelion, and the first was before, so it must be within one orbit.\n\nThe problem says “shortest amount of time”, implying perhaps multiple possibilities, but in this case, since it's specified that it passed aphelion, and velocities have opposite signs, there's only one such arc in one orbit.\n\nBut wait — perhaps the planet could have completed more than one full orbit? But that would take longer, so the shortest is within one orbit.\n\nTherefore, the shortest time is approximately 2.00175 years.\n\nBut let's express it more accurately.\n\nWe can compute exactly without approximating a.\n\nEarlier, we had a³ = 50, so a = 50^{1/3}\n\nBut in the calculation of ν, we used a = 3.684, but let's keep symbolic.\n\nr = a(1-e²)/(1+e cosν)\n\nSo for r=3: 3 = a*0.75 / (1 + 0.5 cosν₁)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν₁ = 0.75a / 3 = 0.25a\n→ cosν₁ = 2*(0.25a - 1) = 0.5a - 2\n\nSimilarly, for r=4: 4 = 0.75a / (1 + 0.5 cosν₂)\n→ 1 + 0.5 cosν₂ = 0.75a / 4 = 0.1875a\n→ cosν₂ = 2*(0.1875a - 1) = 0.375a - 2\n\nWith a = 50^{1/3} ≈ 3.68403\n\nThen cosν₁ = 0.5*3.68403 - 2 = 1.842015 - 2 = -0.157985\nν₁ = arccos(-0.157985) = 100.0° (approx)\n\nSimilarly, cosν₂ = 0.375*3.68403 - 2 = 1.381511 - 2 = -0.618489\nν₂ = arccos(-0.618489)",1.1025

Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$. We now rearrange for $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\ell}{a}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\ell}{a}$. Plugging in $\frac{\ell}{a} = 0.01$

  ""solution"": ""To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angular resolution of a telescope affects the maximum distance at which stellar parallax can be measured, and how that changes when observing from Mars versus Earth.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Parallax Measurement\nThe parallax angle (θ) is defined as the apparent shift in position of a star due to Earth's (or Mars's) orbital motion. The parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance to the star:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{1 \\text{ AU}}{d} \\]\n\nwhere θ is in radians, and d is the distance in AU.\n\nHowever, in practice, we measure parallax using the baseline of the observer’s orbit. For Earth, the baseline is 2 AU (from one side of the orbit to the other). For Mars, the baseline is 2 × 1.524 AU = 3.048 AU.\n\nBut the angular resolution of the telescope limits the smallest parallax angle we can detect. If the telescope has an angular resolution of 0.01 arcseconds, then we can only measure stars whose parallax is ≥ 0.01 arcseconds.\n\n### Step 2: Maximum Distance for Detectable Parallax\nThe maximum distance at which a star can have a measurable parallax is given by:\n\n\\[ d_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\text{baseline}}{\\theta_{\\text{min}}} \\]\n\nwhere θ_min is the angular resolution (in radians), and baseline is the diameter of the orbit (in AU).\n\nWe must convert 0.01 arcseconds to radians:\n\n\\[ 0.01 \\text{ arcsec} = 0.01 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180 \\times 3600}\\right) \\text{ radians} \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.01 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{648000} \\approx 4.848 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ radians} \\]\n\nNow, for Earth:\n\n\\[ d_{\\text{max, Earth}} = \\frac{2 \\text{ AU}}{4.848 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 4.13 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ AU} \\]\n\nFor Mars:\n\n\\[ d_{\\text{max, Mars}} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.524 \\text{ AU}}{4.848 \\times 10^{-11}} = \\frac{3.048}{4.848 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 6.29 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ AU} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Ratio of Number of Measurable Stars\nThe number of stars we can measure parallax for scales with the volume of space we can probe. Since stars are roughly uniformly distributed in space (on large scales), the number of stars within a certain distance is proportional to the cube of that distance:\n\n\\[ N \\propto d^3 \\]\n\nSo the ratio of the number of stars measurable from Mars to Earth is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\text{Mars}}}{N_{\\text{Earth}}} = \\left( \\frac{d_{\\text{max, Mars}}}{d_{\\text{max, Earth}}} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{6.29 \\times 10^{10}}{4.13 \\times 10^{10}} \\right)^3 \\approx \\left(1.524\\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ = 1.524^3 = 1.524 \\times 1.524 \\times 1.524 \\]\n\nCalculate step-by-step:\n\n- 1.524 × 1.524 = 2.322576\n- 2.322576 × 1.524 ≈ 3.537\n\nSo approximately:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_{\\text{Mars}}}{N_{\\text{Earth}}} \\approx 3.537 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the ratio of the number of stars we can measure the parallax distance to using this telescope on Mars compared to Earth is approximately 3.537."",

  ""solution"": ""To determine the time it takes for the comet to travel from point A to point B along its elliptical orbit, we must use Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. Specifically, Kepler’s second law (the law of equal areas) tells us that a line segment joining a planet and the star sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This implies that the comet moves faster when closer to the star and slower when farther away.\n\nIn the diagram:\n- The star is located at one focus of the ellipse (not at the center).\n- Points A and B are located on the minor axis of the ellipse, symmetric with respect to the major axis.\n- Since the orbit is counterclockwise, moving from A to B means traversing half of the ellipse — specifically, the upper half.\n\nHowever, because the star is not at the center but at one focus, the two halves of the orbit (upper and lower) are **not** equal in time. The comet spends more time in the part of the orbit farther from the star (the aphelion side), and less time near the perihelion (closest point).\n\nBut points A and B lie on the minor axis, meaning they are equidistant from the star only if the orbit were circular — which it isn’t. In an elliptical orbit, the distance from the star to point A and point B is **not** the same unless the eccentricity e = 0.\n\nActually, in an elliptical orbit, the points on the minor axis are **not** symmetric in terms of area swept relative to the star. However, there is a well-known result in orbital mechanics: the time taken to go from the perihelion to the aphelion (or vice versa) is exactly half the orbital period T, because the orbit is symmetric with respect to the major axis, and by Kepler’s second law, the areas swept from perihelion to aphelion and back are equal.\n\nBut here, the comet is moving from point A to point B — which are endpoints of the minor axis — not perihelion to aphelion.\n\nLet’s define:\n- Perihelion: closest point to the star (on the major axis).\n- Aphelion: farthest point from the star (on the major axis).\n- The minor axis endpoints A and B are perpendicular to the major axis.\n\nThe key insight: the total area of the ellipse is πab, where a is semi-major axis, b is semi-minor axis. The comet sweeps this area in time T.\n\nBy Kepler’s second law, the time to sweep a certain area is proportional to that area.\n\nSo, the time to go from A to B is the time to sweep the area of the upper half of the ellipse — but again, since the star is at a focus, not the center, the area swept from A to B is **not** simply half the ellipse.\n\nWe need to compute the area swept by the radius vector from the star as the comet moves from A to B.\n\nThis requires integrating the area swept under the ellipse, with the star at one focus.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the concept of **mean anomaly** and **eccentric anomaly**, or refer to known results.\n\nActually, there is a standard result: the time to go from the end of the minor axis to the other end (A to B) is **T/2** only if the orbit is circular. For an elliptical orbit, it is **not** T/2.\n\nLet’s think geometrically.\n\nIn an ellipse, the star is located at a focus, so the distance from the star to point A and point B is different.\n\nSpecifically, let’s denote:\n- Semi-major axis = a\n- Eccentricity = e\n- Distance from center to focus = ae\n\nThen, the coordinates of the foci are (±ae, 0) if the ellipse is aligned with x-axis.\n\nAssume the star is at the left focus: (-ae, 0)\n\nPoints A and B are at (0, ±b), where b = a√(1−e²)\n\nSo, the distance from the star to point A is:\n\nd_A = √[(0 - (-ae))² + (b - 0)²] = √[a²e² + a²(1−e²)] = √[a²e² + a² − a²e²] = √[a²] = a\n\nSimilarly, distance to B is also a.\n\nWait! That’s interesting. So both A and B are at distance a from the star? Let me check:\n\nYes! In an ellipse, the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a.\n\nAt point A (end of minor axis), distance to each focus is:\n\nd₁ = √[(ae)^2 + b^2] = √[a²e² + a²(1−e²)] = √[a²] = a\n\nSimilarly for d₂ = a. So yes, at the ends of the minor axis, the distance to each focus is a.\n\nTherefore, points A and B are **equidistant** from the star — both at distance a.\n\nNow, does that mean the time from A to B is T/2?\n\nNot necessarily, because even though they are at equal distance, the path is curved, and the speed varies due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nBut here’s a crucial fact: the orbit is symmetric with respect to the major axis. And points A and B are symmetric with respect to the major axis.\n\nMoreover, the area swept from A to B (counterclockwise) should be equal to the area swept from B to A clockwise — but since the star is at a focus, and the orbit is symmetric, the area swept from A to B (upper half) equals the area swept from B to A (lower half)?\n\nWait — no, because the star is not at the center. But the ellipse is symmetric about the major axis, and the star lies on the major axis. Therefore, the area swept from A to B (upper half) is equal to the area swept from B to A (lower half). Because reflecting over the major axis maps the upper half to the lower half, and the star is fixed on the axis.\n\nThus, the area swept from A to B is exactly half the total area of the ellipse.\n\nSince Kepler’s second law says that area swept is proportional to time, and the total area is swept in time T, then the time to sweep half the area is T/2.\n\nTherefore, the time from A to B is T/2.\n\nThis is true regardless of eccentricity e, because the symmetry argument holds for any ellipse — the star is on the axis of symmetry, and points A and B are symmetric with respect to that axis.\n\nThus, the time from A to B is always T/2, independent of e.\n\nSo the expression is T/2.\n\nFinal answer: T/2"",

  ""solution"": ""To determine the total mass of the binary star system, we can use Kepler’s Third Law for binary stars.

Since eclipsing binaries typically show a full cycle (primary and secondary eclipse) every orbital period, we assume this 4-year interval corresponds to one full orbital period.\n\nThus, \( P = 4 \\) years.\n\nThe distance between the stars is given as 14.8 AU. In a binary system, this distance is the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars’ orbits around the center of mass.

Typical binary systems have total masses on the order of a few to tens of solar masses.

  ""solution"": ""We are given that an artificial Earth satellite moves in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane. An observer at latitude φ = 35.6° sees the satellite cross the local meridian (i.e., at culmination) with zenith distance z = 46.0°. We are to find the geocentric distance of the satellite, expressed in units of Earth’s radius R.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nThe satellite is in the equatorial plane, so its orbital plane coincides with the Earth’s equator. The observer is at latitude φ = 35.6°, which means their position on Earth is displaced from the equator by this angle.\n\nAt culmination, the satellite crosses the observer’s meridian — i.e., it reaches its highest point in the sky for that observer. At that moment, the satellite lies in the plane defined by the observer’s zenith and the celestial north pole — which is also the observer’s meridian plane.\n\nFrom the diagram provided (and standard astronomical geometry), we can consider a triangle formed by:\n- The center of the Earth (point O)\n- The observer (point on Earth’s surface)\n- The satellite (in orbit)\n\nIn this triangle:\n- One side is the Earth’s radius, R (from center to observer)\n- Another side is the geocentric distance of the satellite, let’s call it S (what we want to find)\n- The included angle between these two sides is the angular separation between the observer’s position and the satellite’s position as seen from Earth’s center.\n\nBut note: since the satellite is in the equatorial plane, and the observer is at latitude φ, the angular separation between the observer and the satellite (as seen from Earth’s center) is simply φ, because the satellite is directly over the equator, and the observer is at latitude φ.\n\nWait — that’s not quite right. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, when the satellite is at culmination, it is located along the observer’s meridian. Since the satellite is in the equatorial plane, its declination is 0°. The observer is at latitude φ = 35.6°, so the altitude of the celestial equator at culmination is 90° - φ = 54.4°.\n\nBut the satellite is crossing the meridian at zenith distance z = 46.0°, meaning its altitude is 90° - z = 44.0°.\n\nSo, the satellite is below the celestial equator (since 44.0° < 54.4°), but still above the horizon.\n\nThis suggests that the satellite is not directly overhead the equator from the observer’s perspective — but rather, its position in the sky corresponds to a certain angular distance from the zenith.\n\nLet’s go back to the diagram. In the diagram, we see a triangle formed by:\n- Earth’s center (O)\n- Observer (on surface, distance R from O)\n- Satellite (distance S from O)\n\nThe angle at the observer between the direction to the zenith and to the satellite is the zenith distance z = 46.0°.\n\nBut the zenith direction is radial from the observer to the center of the Earth? No — the zenith is perpendicular to the local horizontal, which is perpendicular to the local radius vector. So the line from observer to zenith is perpendicular to the radius vector from Earth’s center to observer.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the radius vector (R) and the line to the satellite (S) is equal to the zenith distance z = 46.0°.\n\nWait — let's think carefully.\n\nAt culmination, the satellite lies in the observer’s meridian. The zenith is directly overhead. The angle between the direction to the zenith and the direction to the satellite is the zenith distance z = 46.0°.\n\nThe line from the observer to the Earth’s center is along the local vertical (the radius vector). The zenith is in the opposite direction — so the angle between the radius vector and the direction to the satellite is 180° - z?\n\nNo — actually, if you are standing on Earth, your zenith is straight up, and the direction to the center of the Earth is straight down. So the angle between the direction to the satellite and the direction to the center of the Earth is 90° + z? Let me draw this mentally.\n\nBetter approach: Use spherical trigonometry or vector geometry.\n\n### Step 2: Use Law of Cosines in triangle\n\nConsider triangle formed by:\n- Earth’s center (O)\n- Observer (P)\n- Satellite (S)\n\nWe know:\n- OP = R (Earth’s radius)\n- OS = S (geocentric distance of satellite — unknown)\n- PS = ?\n- Angle at P: angle between OP and PS.\n\nWhat is the angle at P? That is the angle between the direction to the Earth’s center and the direction to the satellite.\n\nSince the zenith is perpendicular to OP, and the zenith distance is z, then the angle between OP and PS is 90° + z? Or 90° - z?\n\nActually, if the satellite is at zenith distance z, then the angle between the zenith and the satellite is z. Since the zenith is perpendicular to OP, the angle between OP and PS is 90° - z.\n\nWait — no. If the satellite is directly overhead (z=0), then PS is parallel to the zenith, so perpendicular to OP. So angle between OP and PS is 90°.\n\nIf the satellite is at zenith distance z, then the angle between the zenith and the satellite is z, so the angle between OP and PS is 90° - z.\n\nYes — because the zenith is perpendicular to OP. So if the satellite is at angle z from zenith, then the angle between OP and PS is 90° - z.\n\nSo in triangle OPS:\n- Side OP = R\n- Side OS = S\n- Angle at P = 90° - z\n\nWe also know that the satellite is in the equatorial plane, and the observer is at latitude φ. Therefore, the angle at O (angle between OP and OS) is φ.\n\nIs that correct? The satellite is directly over the equator, so its position vector lies in the equatorial plane. The observer is at latitude φ, so the angle between the observer’s position vector and the equatorial plane is φ. Therefore, the angle between OP and OS is φ.\n\nYes — because OS is along the equator, and OP is at latitude φ, so the angle between them is φ.\n\nSo now we have triangle OPS with:\n- Side OP = R\n- Side OS = S\n- Angle at O = φ = 35.6°\n- Angle at P = 90° - z = 90° - 46.0° = 44.0°\n\nThen, the angle at S = 180° - φ - (90° - z) = 90° - φ + z\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Sines:\n\nIn triangle OPS:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(\\angle at P)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(\\angle at S)} \\]\n\nThat is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(90^\circ - z)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(90^\circ - \\phi + z)} \\]\n\nNote that sin(90° - x) = cos(x), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\cos z} = \\frac{R}{\\cos(\\phi - z)} \\]\n\nWait — let me check the angle at S again.\n\nAngle at S = 180° - φ - (90° - z) = 90° - φ + z\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(90^\circ - z)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(90^\circ - \\phi + z)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Rightarrow \\frac{S}{\\cos z} = \\frac{R}{\\cos(\\phi - z)} \\]\n\nWait — sin(90° - φ + z) = sin(90° + (z - φ)) = cos(z - φ) = cos(φ - z), since cosine is even.\n\nSo yes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\cos z} = \\frac{R}{\\cos(\\phi - z)} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\cos z}{\\cos(\\phi - z)} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n- z = 46.0°\n- φ = 35.6°\n- φ - z = 35.6° - 46.0° = -10.4°\n- cos(φ - z) = cos(-10.4°) = cos(10.4°)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\cos 46.0^\circ}{\\cos 10.4^\circ} \\]\n\nCompute numerically:\n- cos(46.0°) ≈ 0.6947\n- cos(10.4°) ≈ 0.9836\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S \\approx R \\cdot \\frac{0.6947}{0.9836} \\approx R \\cdot 0.7063 \\]\n\nWait — that gives S < R, which is impossible for a satellite in orbit! Something is wrong.\n\nAh — I think I made a mistake in the angle at S.\n\nLet me recompute angles.\n\nTriangle OPS:\n- Angle at O: φ = 35.6°\n- Angle at P: 90° - z = 44.0°\n- Then angle at S = 180° - 35.6° - 44.0° = 100.4°\n\nI see! I mistakenly computed angle at S as 90° - φ + z, but that was wrong.\n\nCorrectly:\n\nAngle at S = 180° - angle at O - angle at P = 180° - φ - (90° - z) = 90° - φ + z? Wait:\n\n180 - φ - (90 - z) = 180 - φ - 90 + z = 90 - φ + z\n\nWith φ = 35.6°, z = 46.0°, so 90 - 35.6 + 46.0 = 100.4° — yes, that matches.\n\nBut then sin(angle at S) = sin(100.4°) = sin(180° - 100.4°) = sin(79.6°) ≈ 0.9836 — same as cos(10.4°), since sin(79.6°) = cos(10.4°).\n\nSo Law of Sines:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(\\angle at P)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(\\angle at S)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(44.0^\circ)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(100.4^\circ)} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(44.0^\circ)}{\\sin(100.4^\circ)} \\]\n\nCompute:\n- sin(44.0°) ≈ 0.7193\n- sin(100.4°) = sin(180° - 79.6°) = sin(79.6°) ≈ 0.9836\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S \\approx R \\cdot \\frac{0.7193}{0.9836} \\approx R \\cdot 0.7312 \\]\n\nStill less than R — impossible!\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nPerhaps the angle at P is not 90° - z.\n\nLet me rethink the geometry.\n\nThe observer is at latitude φ. The zenith is perpendicular to the local horizontal, which is perpendicular to the radius vector OP. So the zenith direction is antiparallel to OP.\n\nThe satellite is at zenith distance z, meaning the angle between the zenith and the satellite is z.\n\nSo the angle between the direction to the satellite and the direction to the center of the Earth (which is opposite to zenith) is 180° - z.\n\nWait — if the satellite is at zenith distance z, then the angle between the zenith and the satellite is z. Since the zenith is in the direction away from Earth’s center, the angle between the satellite and the Earth’s center is 180° - z.\n\nYes — that makes sense.\n\nFor example, if z = 0°, satellite is at zenith — angle between satellite and Earth’s center is 180°.\n\nIf z = 90°, satellite is on horizon — angle between satellite and Earth’s center is 90°.\n\nSo in triangle OPS, angle at P is 180° - z.\n\nBut in a triangle, angles must be less than 180°, and sum to 180°.\n\nIf angle at P is 180° - z, and z = 46.0°, then angle at P = 134.0°.\n\nThen angle at O is φ = 35.6°\n\nThen angle at S = 180° - 134.0° - 35.6° = 10.4°\n\nNow, Law of Sines:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(\\angle at P)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(\\angle at S)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(134.0^\circ)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(10.4^\circ)} \\]\n\nNote that sin(134.0°) = sin(180° - 46.0°) = sin(46.0°) ≈ 0.7193\n\nsin(10.4°) ≈ 0.1809\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(134.0^\circ)}{\\sin(10.4^\circ)} = R \\cdot \\frac{0.7193}{0.1809} \\approx R \\cdot 3.976 \\]\n\nThis is reasonable — about 4 times Earth’s radius.\n\nLet me confirm the geometry.\n\nIn triangle OPS:\n- OP = R\n- OS = S\n- Angle at O: φ = 35.6° — the angular separation between observer and satellite as seen from Earth’s center. Since satellite is in equatorial plane and observer is at latitude φ, this is correct.\n- Angle at P: the angle between vectors PO and PS. Vector PO is toward Earth’s center. Vector PS is toward satellite. The angle between them is 180° - z, as explained — because z is the zenith distance, and zenith is opposite to PO.\n- Then angle at S: 10.4°, as calculated.\n\nLaw of Sines gives S = R * sin(134°)/sin(10.4°) ≈ R * 0.7193 / 0.1809 ≈ R * 3.976\n\nSo geocentric distance is approximately 3.98 Earth radii.\n\nLet me compute more precisely.\n\nUse exact values:\n\nφ = 35.6°\nz = 46.0°\n\nAngle at P = 180° - z = 134.0°\nAngle at S = 180° - φ - (180° - z) = z - φ = 46.0° - 35.6° = 10.4°\n\nYes, simpler: angle at S = z - φ\n\nBecause angle at O is φ, angle at P is 180° - z, so angle at S = 180° - φ - (180° - z) = z - φ\n\nAnd since z > φ, this is positive, good.\n\nSo Law of Sines:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S}{\\sin(180^\circ - z)} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(z - \\phi)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Rightarrow S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(180^\circ - z)}{\\sin(z - \\phi)} = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin z}{\\sin(z - \\phi)} \\]\n\nSince sin(180° - z) = sin z.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ S = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin 46.0^\circ}{\\sin(46.0^\circ - 35.6^\circ)} = R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin 46.0^\circ}{\\sin 10.4^\circ} \\]\n\nNow compute accurately:\n\nsin(46.0°) = sin(46) ≈ 0.7193398\n\nsin(10.4°) = sin(10.4) ≈ 0.1808855\n\nSo:\n\nS = R * 0.7193398 / 0.1808855 ≈ R * 3.976\n\nSo approximately 3.98 R.\n\nTo be precise, let's use calculator-style precision.\n\nUsing more digits:\n\nsin(46.0°) = sin(46) = 0.719339800338\n\nsin(10.4°) = sin(10.4) = 0.180885477273\n\nRatio = 0.719339800338 / 0.180885477273 ≈ 3.97600000000\n\nExactly 3.976?

9,"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

$V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})}+V_{\mathrm{s}}$

where, $\gamma=2\times10^{-8}\text{ km}^{-1}$, $V_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the constant speed of the solar wind, $R_{0}$ and $V_{0}$ are the distance and velocity, respectively, at time $t_{0}$, and $S$ is the sign factor. $S=1$ if $V_{0}>V_{\mathrm{s}}$; $S=-1$ if $V_{0}\leq V_{\mathrm{s}}$.

<image>JSTL-Fig-9</image>As shown in the figure show the observed radial distance from the surface of the Sun, $R_\mathrm{obs}(t)$ (measured in R$_\odot)$, as a function of time, $t$ (in hours), for two CMEs: CME-3 and CME-4. The last data point in each table (D5 and P8, respectively) corresponds to the arrival time of the respective CME at Earth. For this part, assume $V_{\mathrm{s} }= 330$ km $s^{- 1}$.

We shall evaluate if the “drag-only” model satisfactorily predicts the arrival times of these CMEs. To use this model an appropriate choice of $t_0$, and corresponding $R_0$ and $V_{0}$ needs to be made.

For CME-3, take the following two cases:

(C1) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D1-D2 .

(C2) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D3-D4.

Assume the velocity remains constant in each specific interval D1-D2 and D3-D4, but may differ between the two intervals. Using $t_{0},R_{0}$, and $V_{0}$, calculate the difference between the observed and the predicted radial distance, $\delta R_{\mathrm{D}}\equiv R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)-R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$ in units of R$_\odot$ at $t=58.05h$,  for each of the two cases.","Step1: Inserting, $R_{0}$, $t_{0}$, $V_{0}$, and $V_{s}$ in the given expression

we get: Case C1:  $R_{0}=\frac{7.99+6.36}{2}$,  $R_{0}=7.18 R_{\odot}$,  $t_{0}=\frac{0.20+0.48}{2}=0.340 \mathrm{~h}$, $V_{0}=\frac{(7.99-6.36) \times 695700}{(0.48-0.20) \times 3600}$,  $V_{0}=1.12 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$

10,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$ kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise.

  ""solution"": ""We are given a graph showing the line-of-sight (radial) velocity (solid red curve) and transverse velocity (dashed blue curve) of stars at a distance of 100 pc from the Sun, as a function of Galactic longitude $l$. We are to estimate the Sun’s orbital period $P$ around the Galactic Center (GC), given that the Sun is at a distance $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc from the GC.\n\nThe key is to use the provided expressions for the observed velocities:\n\n- Radial (line-of-sight) velocity: $V_r = (\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\sin l$\n- Transverse velocity: $V_t = (\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\cos l - \\Omega D$\n\nBut note: the problem states that these velocities are measured for HI clouds, but the graph is for stars at 100 pc from the Sun. Since 100 pc is much smaller than 8.5 kpc, we can approximate that these stars are very close to the Sun, so their angular velocity $\\Omega$ is approximately equal to the Sun's angular velocity $\\Omega_0$, i.e., they are in nearly the same circular orbit. Thus, $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) \\approx 0$.\n\nHowever, if $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) \\approx 0$, then both $V_r$ and $V_t$ would be approximately zero — which contradicts the graph. Therefore, this approximation must not hold exactly, or perhaps the graph is not for stars at exactly the same radius, or there is differential rotation.\n\nBut let’s think differently. The graph shows velocity variations with Galactic longitude. The radial velocity curve (red) has a sinusoidal shape with amplitude ~1.5 km/s and period 360°. Similarly, the transverse velocity (blue) also has a sinusoidal shape with amplitude ~2.5 km/s.\n\nFrom the expression for radial velocity: $V_r = (\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\sin l$\n\nThis is a sine wave with amplitude $|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| R_0$. From the graph, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the red curve is about 3 km/s (from +1.5 to -1.5), so the amplitude is 1.5 km/s.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| R_0 = 1.5 \\text{ km/s}\n$$\n\nBut since the Sun is at $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc, and if we assume the cloud is at approximately the same radius (since it's only 100 pc away), then $\\Omega \\approx \\Omega_0$, so the difference should be small — yet we observe a 1.5 km/s variation. This suggests that the cloud is not at exactly $R_0$, or perhaps the graph is for the relative motion due to the Sun's own motion.\n\nWait — actually, the problem says: “the average radial and transverse velocity components of stars at a distance of 100 pc from the Sun”. So these stars are very close to the Sun, meaning they are likely in orbits with similar angular velocity to the Sun, but possibly slightly different due to local differential rotation.\n\nBut here’s an important point: the radial velocity component $V_r = (\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\sin l$ depends on the difference in angular velocities between the cloud and the Sun, multiplied by $R_0$. Since the cloud is only 100 pc away, its radius $R \\approx R_0$, so $\\Omega \\approx \\Omega_0$, but if we assume $\\Omega(R) \\neq \\Omega_0$, then the difference $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0)$ is small, but multiplied by $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc, it gives a measurable velocity.\n\nSo let’s proceed with the radial velocity expression:\n\n$$\nV_r = (\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\sin l\n$$\n\nThe maximum value of $V_r$ occurs when $\\sin l = \\pm 1$, so:\n\n$$\n|V_{r,\\max}| = |\\Omega - \\Omega_0| R_0\n$$\n\nFrom the graph, the maximum radial velocity is about 1.5 km/s (positive peak). So:\n\n$$\n|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| \\cdot 8.5 \\text{ kpc} = 1.5 \\text{ km/s}\n$$\n\nNote: We need consistent units. Convert kpc to cm or m? Better to convert everything to SI or keep in astronomical units.\n\nLet’s convert 8.5 kpc to meters:\n\n1 kpc = $10^3 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{16}$ m ≈ $3.086 \\times 10^{19}$ m\n\nSo 8.5 kpc = $8.5 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{19} \\approx 2.623 \\times 10^{20}$ m\n\nThen:\n\n$$\n|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^3}{2.623 \\times 10^{20}} \\approx 5.72 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ rad/s}\n$$\n\nBut wait — this is the difference in angular velocity. However, we want the Sun’s own angular velocity $\\Omega_0$, because the orbital period is $P = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Omega_0}$.\n\nBut we don’t have $\\Omega_0$ directly. However, notice that the radial velocity expression assumes the cloud is at radius $R$, and we used $R_0$ in the formula. But if the cloud is at 100 pc from the Sun, then its distance from GC is $R \\approx R_0 \\pm 0.1$ kpc. So the difference $\\Omega - \\Omega_0$ is small, and we can approximate it using the derivative of the rotation curve:\n\n$$\n\\Omega(R) \\approx \\Omega_0 + \\left(\\frac{d\\Omega}{dR}\\right)_0 (R - R_0)\n$$\n\nSo $\\Omega - \\Omega_0 \\approx \\left(\\frac{d\\Omega}{dR}\\right)_0 \\Delta R$, where $\\Delta R \\approx 0.1$ kpc.\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| \\approx \\left|\\frac{d\\Omega}{dR}\\right| \\cdot 0.1 \\text{ kpc}\n$$\n\nBut earlier we had:\n\n$$\n|\\Omega - \\Omega_0| \\cdot 8.5 \\text{ kpc} = 1.5 \\text{ km/s}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{d\\Omega}{dR}\\right| \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 8.5 = 1.5 \\Rightarrow \\left|\\frac{d\\Omega}{dR}\\right| = \\frac{1.5}{0.85} \\approx 1.76 \\text{ km/s/kpc}\n$$\n\nBut again, this is not helping us find $\\Omega_0$.\n\nAlternative approach: Let’s consider the transverse velocity component:\n\n$$\nV_t = (\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\cos l - \\Omega D\n$$\n\nIf the cloud is at distance $D = 100$ pc from the Sun, and assuming it is moving in a circular orbit with angular velocity $\\Omega$, then its transverse velocity relative to the Sun is due to two effects: the difference in angular velocities times $R_0$, and the cloud’s own transverse motion minus the Sun’s.\n\nBut perhaps we can ignore the second term if $D$ is small. Wait, $D = 100$ pc = 0.1 kpc, while $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc, so $\\Omega D$ is small compared to $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0$ only if $\\Omega - \\Omega_0$ is small.\n\nActually, let’s plug in numbers. Suppose $\\Omega \\approx \\Omega_0$, then $\\Omega D \\approx \\Omega_0 \\cdot 0.1$ kpc.\n\nBut $\\Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0$, and $V_0$ is typically around 220 km/s for the Sun. So $\\Omega_0 \\approx 220 / 8.5 \\approx 25.88$ km/s/kpc.\n\nThen $\\Omega D \\approx 25.88 \\times 0.1 = 2.588$ km/s.\n\nFrom the graph, the transverse velocity (blue dashed curve) has amplitude about 2.5 km/s, which matches perfectly!\n\nAnd the radial velocity amplitude is 1.5 km/s, which comes from $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0$.\n\nSince $\\Omega D \\approx 2.588$ km/s and the graph shows ~2.5 km/s, this suggests that $\\Omega D$ dominates the transverse velocity, and $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\cos l$ is small.\n\nIn fact, if we assume $\\Omega \\approx \\Omega_0$, then $V_t \\approx -\\Omega D$, which is constant in magnitude and direction depending on position — but the graph shows a cosine dependence, so it’s not constant.\n\nWait — the expression is:\n\n$$\nV_t = (\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\cos l - \\Omega D\n$$\n\nThe term $-\\Omega D$ is constant (if $\\Omega$ is constant), and $(\\Omega - \\Omega_0) R_0 \\cos l$ is a cosine wave.\n\nFrom the graph, the transverse velocity varies between about -3 and 0 km/s, with a minimum at 90° and maximum at 270°, suggesting a cosine-like shape with negative amplitude.\n\nThe amplitude of the varying part is about 1.5 km/s (from -3 to -1.5? Wait, let’s read carefully).\n\nLooking at the graph:\n\n- At $l=0^\circ$: blue curve is ~ -1.5 km/s\n- At $l=90^\circ$: ~ -3 km/s\n- At $l=180^\circ$: ~ -1.5 km/s\n- At $l=270^\circ$: ~ 0 km/s? No, at 270° it’s rising, seems like ~ -1.5? Wait, no — at 270°, it’s near -1.5? Actually, looking again:\n\nAt $l=0^\circ$: blue ~ -1.5\nAt $l=90^\circ$: blue ~ -3\nAt $l=180^\circ$: blue ~ -1.5\nAt $l=270^\circ$: blue ~ 0?\nAt $l=360^\circ$: blue ~ -1.5\n\nActually, it looks like the blue curve goes from -1.5 to -3 to -1.5 to 0 to -1.5 — so it's not symmetric.

11,"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star. This wind-fed accretion is especially significant in systems that include an early-type star (such as an O or B star, indicated henceforth as an OB star), alongside a compact object like a neutron star (NS) in a close orbit. Consider such a NS-OB star binary system where a neutron star of mass $M_{\mathrm{NS}}=2.0\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and radius $R_\mathrm{NS}=11$ km is orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $a$ around the centre of the OB star with velocity $v_\mathrm{orb}=1.5\times10^{5}ms^{-1}$ (<image>JSTL-Fig-11</image>as shown in the figure). Throughout this problem the mass loss from the OB star is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its rate is $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{OB}}=1.0\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.

The accretion radius, $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the maximum distance from the NS at which the stellar wind can be captured by the NS. If the stellar wind speed at the orbital distance of the NS is $v_\mathrm{w}=3.0\times10^6m s^{-1}$, find $R_\mathrm{acc}$ for the above system in km using standard escape velocity calculations.","Step1: The accretion radius can be estimated by equating the gravitational potential energy of the stellar wind to its kinetic energy

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{w}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = \frac{G M_{\mathrm{NS}} \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\mathrm{acc}}}\Longrightarrow \quad R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}}$

where, $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the wind density and $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity of the wind.

Get:

For the case considered above $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} + v_{\mathrm{orb}}^{2}$

Step2: Here, $v_{\mathrm{w}} \gg v_{\mathrm{orb}}$, therefore, $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} \approx v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} = 9 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{m}^{2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$.

  ""solution"": ""To find the accretion radius $ R_{\\mathrm{acc}} $, we use the concept of capture radius in wind-fed accretion. The accretion radius is the distance from the neutron star (NS) at which the gravitational potential energy of a wind particle equals its kinetic energy, assuming the wind is captured if it can be slowed down to zero velocity by the NS's gravity.\n\nThis is analogous to the escape velocity condition: a particle at distance $ R_{\\mathrm{acc}} $ from the NS with speed $ v_w $ will just be captured if its kinetic energy equals the gravitational potential energy needed to reach infinity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_w^2 = \\frac{G M_{\\mathrm{NS}} m}{R_{\\mathrm{acc}}}\n$$\n\nCanceling mass $ m $, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} v_w^2 = \\frac{G M_{\\mathrm{NS}}}{R_{\\mathrm{acc}}}\n$$\n\nSolving for $ R_{\\mathrm{acc}} $:\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{2 G M_{\\mathrm{NS}}}{v_w^2}\n$$\n\nNow plug in the values:\n\n- $ G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}} $\n- $ M_{\\mathrm{NS}} = 2.0 \\, M_\\odot = 2.0 \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 3.978 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\mathrm{kg} $\n- $ v_w = 3.0 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} $\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n$$\n2 G M_{\\mathrm{NS}} = 2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3.978 \\times 10^{30} = 5.277 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^3 s^{-2}}\n$$\n\nDenominator:\n\n$$\nv_w^2 = (3.0 \\times 10^6)^2 = 9.0 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-2}}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{5.277 \\times 10^{20}}{9.0 \\times 10^{12}} = 5.863 \\times 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{m} = 5.863 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{km}\n$$\n\nSo, rounding appropriately, we get:\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\approx 5.86 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{km}\n$$\n\nNote: This calculation assumes that the wind particles are moving radially and that the orbital motion of the NS does not significantly affect the capture (i.e., we neglect the orbital velocity $ v_{\\mathrm{orb}} $ in this simplified model).

12,"<image>JSTL-Fig-12</image>As shown in the figure, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has released an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87 galaxy. To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

where $r\in(R_{\mathrm{SC}},\infty)$ is the radial coordinate, $\phi\in[0,2\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle, and $E$ and $L$ are constants related to the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum, respectively. Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem. Another useful equation is obtained by differentiating the first equation: $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

Circular light trajectories can exist around the black hole. Find the radius, $r_{\rm ph}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\rm ph}$, for such photon trajectories in terms of $M$ and relevant constants.","Step1: Circular trajectories have $r = \mathrm{constant}$. Hence, the radial velocity $v_r = 0$ and rate of change of radial component of velocity $\frac{dv_r}{dt} = 0$. From the third equation, $\frac{dv_r}{dt} - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0,$

Get:

we get radius $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$ of circular orbits to be $r_{\mathrm{ph}} = 3GM/c^2$

Step2: Then from the first equation, the impact parameter is found to be $b_{\mathrm{ph}} = L/\sqrt{2E} = 3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$ .

13,"An astrophysical survey mapped all the galaxies in a small region of the sky, of angular diameter $\Delta\theta=0.01$ rad, where many galaxies seemed to be concentrated around the central area of the image. When the positions and redshifts of all the galaxies in this cluster were measured, an interesting distribution emerged. As shown in the figure. <image>JSTL-Fig-13</image>

Using these observations, estimate the total mass of the galaxy cluster and express your answer in solar masses. Assume that this galaxy cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, with a root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_{z}=\sqrt{\langle(z-0.7)^{2}\rangle}=0.0005$. Feel free to make reasonable approximations when considering the average velocities, masses, and spatial distribution of the galaxies. Consider that the distance to $\bar{z}=0.7$ in the standard cosmological model is $D_{A}=1500$ Mpc. Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion. Notice, however, that only the dispersion in redshift is given, which translates into a radial velocity dispersion: $\sigma_{v_{r}}=c\cdot\sigma_{z}=2.998\times10^{8}\:\mathrm{m/s}\times0.0005=1.499\times10^{5}\:\mathrm{m/s}$

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

Get:

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

And, assuming the cluster is spherical, its radius is: $R=\frac{D_A\cdot\Delta\theta}{2}=\frac{1500\times10^6\times206265\times1.496\times10^{11}\times10^{-2}}{2}=2.3143\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{m}$

We need to convert $\\sigma_z$ to $\\sigma_v$.\n\n### Step 1: Convert redshift dispersion to velocity dispersion\n\nIn cosmology, for small redshifts, the relation between redshift and recessional velocity is approximately:\n\n$$\nv = cz\n$$\n\nTherefore, the velocity dispersion is:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_v = c \\cdot \\sigma_z\n$$\n\nGiven $\\sigma_z = 0.0005$ and $c = 3 \\times 10^5$ km/s:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_v = 3 \\times 10^5 \\times 0.0005 = 150 \\text{ km/s} = 1.5 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Estimate the physical size of the cluster\n\nWe are given the angular diameter $\\Delta\\theta = 0.01$ rad, and the angular diameter distance to the cluster $D_A = 1500$ Mpc.\n\nThe physical diameter $D$ is:\n\n$$\nD = D_A \\cdot \\Delta\\theta\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nD = 1500 \\times 10^6 \\text{ pc} \\times 0.01 = 15 \\times 10^6 \\text{ pc} = 15 \\text{ Mpc}\n$$\n\nThis is the diameter, so the radius $R$ is half of that:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \\text{ Mpc} = 7.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ pc}\n$$\n\nConvert to meters for consistency with SI units:\n\n$$\n1 \\text{ pc} \\approx 3.086 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nR = 7.5 \\times 10^6 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{16} \\approx 2.3145 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ m}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Apply the virial theorem\n\nUse:\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{3\\sigma_v^2 R}{G}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\sigma_v = 1.5 \\times 10^5$ m/s\n- $R = 2.3145 \\times 10^{23}$ m\n- $G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ kg}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-2}$\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 R = (1.5 \\times 10^5)^2 \\times 2.3145 \\times 10^{23} = 2.25 \\times 10^{10} \\times 2.3145 \\times 10^{23} = 5.207625 \\times 10^{33}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{3 \\times 5.207625 \\times 10^{33}}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx \\frac{1.5622875 \\times 10^{34}}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 2.341 \\times 10^{44} \\text{ kg}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Convert to solar masses\n\nMass of Sun $M_\\odot \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30}$ kg.\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{2.341 \\times 10^{44}}{1.989 \\times 10^{30}} \\approx 1.177 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ solar masses}\n$$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThis is a reasonable estimate for the total mass of a massive galaxy cluster. The calculation assumes spherical symmetry, isotropic velocities, and dynamical equilibrium — all standard approximations in such analyses.\n\nNote: Some authors use a factor of 2 instead of 3 in the virial formula depending on assumptions about the density profile or velocity anisotropy, but 3 is appropriate for a general virial estimate assuming random motions.\n\nThus, the estimated total mass is approximately $1.2 \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$."",

14,"Observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background favour a flat (Euclidean) geometry, in which the total mass density (i.e.  density of matter and equivalent mass density of all forms of energy) should be equal to the so-called critical density: $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}\:=\:\frac{3\:H_{0}^{2}}{8\:\pi\:G}$,

where $H_{0}$ is the present value of the Hubble constant. However, the total density of matter (luminous and dark) is estimated at $\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}\:\approx\:2.8\cdot10^{-27}\:\mathrm{kg}\:\mathrm{m}^{-3}\:.$

To resolve this discrepancy, the standard cosmological model assumes that the Universe is filled with a mysterious ‘dark energy’ of constant energy density $E_\Lambda.$ Determine the value of $E_\Lambda$ and calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy. Neglect the contribution of electromagnetic radiation.

Get:

Step2: In flat geometry we have: $\rho_{m, 0}+\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{c^{2}}=\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$

Hence $E_{\Lambda}$ is given by: $E_{\Lambda}=\left[\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}-\rho_{m, 0}\right] c^{2} \approx 5.756 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

The linear scale of the Universe, $a$, is related to the cosmological redshift: $a(z)=a_{0} /(1+z)$

Get:

Thus, the matter density, $\rho_{m}$, increases with redshift: $\rho_{m}(z)=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3}$

Step3: We substitute the matter density, $\rho_{m}$ by the energy density, $E_{m}$, using the relationship $E=m c^{2}$

$E_{m}(z)=\rho_{m}(z) c^{2}=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3} c^{2}$

But we need the semi-major axis of the **relative orbit** (i.e., the sum of the two semi-major axes, $a_1 + a_2$).\n\n### Step 4: Use mass ratio to find total semi-major axis\n\nLet $m_A$ and $m_B$ be the masses of stars A and B, respectively.\n\nGiven mass ratio: $\\frac{m_A}{m_B} = 1.026$, so $m_A = 1.026 m_B$.\n\nIn a binary system, the center of mass condition gives:\n\n$$\nm_A a_A = m_B a_B\n\\Rightarrow a_A = \\frac{m_B}{m_A} a_B = \\frac{1}{1.026} a_B\n$$\n\nTherefore, the total semi-major axis of the relative orbit is:\n\n$$\na_{\\text{rel}} = a_A + a_B = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.026} + 1\\right) a_B \\approx (0.9747 + 1) \\times a_B = 1.9747 \\times a_B\n$$\n\nWe found $a_B = 1.247 \\times 10^{10}$ meters, so:\n\n$$\na_{\\text{rel}} \\approx 1.9747 \\times 1.247 \\times 10^{10} \\approx 2.458 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ meters}\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Convert orbital period to seconds\n\nOrbital period $P = 3.96$ days.\n\n$$\nP = 3.96 \\times 24 \\times 3600 = 3.96 \\times 86400 = 342,144 \\text{ seconds}\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Apply Kepler’s Third Law\n\nKepler’s Law:\n\n$$\nM_1 + M_2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a_{\\text{rel}}^3}{G P^2}\n$$\n\nUse $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}$\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n$$\n4\\pi^2 a_{\\text{rel}}^3 = 4 \\times \\pi^2 \\times (2.458 \\times 10^{10})^3\n$$\n\nFirst, compute $(2.458 \\times 10^{10})^3 = 2.458^3 \\times 10^{30} \\approx 14.88 \\times 10^{30} = 1.488 \\times 10^{31}$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n4\\pi^2 \\times 1.488 \\times 10^{31} \\approx 4 \\times 9.8696 \\times 1.488 \\times 10^{31} \\approx 39.4784 \\times 1.488 \\times 10^{31} \\approx 58.67 \\times 10^{31} = 5.867 \\times 10^{32}\n$$\n\nDenominator:\n\n$$\nG P^2 = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\times (342144)^2\n$$\n\nFirst, $342144^2 = (3.42144 \\times 10^5)^2 = 1.1699 \\times 10^{11}$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\nG P^2 = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 1.1699 \\times 10^{11} \\approx 6.67430 \\times 1.1699 \\approx 7.814\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nM_1 + M_2 \\approx \\frac{5.867 \\times 10^{32}}{7.814} \\approx 7.499 \\times 10^{31} \\text{ kg}\n$$\n\n### Step 7: Convert to solar masses\n\nMass of Sun $M_\\odot = 1.9885 \\times 10^{30}$ kg\n\n$$\n\\frac{7.499 \\times 10^{31}}{1.9885 \\times 10^{30}} \\approx 37.71\n$$\n\nSo the total mass is approximately **37.7 solar masses**.\n\nBut wait — this seems too high for a binary system like Menkalinan. Let’s double-check our steps.\n\nActually, there is a mistake here: the angular semi-major axis given is for Menkalinan B, but in binary systems, the angular separation observed is typically the projected separation between the two stars, not the semi-major axis of one component.\n\nBut the problem says: \""the semi-major axis for Menkalinan B (smaller star) was measured to be 3.35 milliarcseconds\"" — meaning this is the angular semi-major axis of star B's orbit around the center of mass.\n\nThat part is correct.\n\nBut let’s verify the calculation with standard astronomy formulas.\n\n### Alternative approach using standard formula for binary systems\n\nIn astronomy, we often use:\n\n$$\nM_1 + M_2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{P^2 G} a_{\\text{rel}}^3\n$$\n\nBut also, if we have angular separation $\\theta$ (in arcseconds) and distance $d$ (in parsecs), then the physical semi-major axis is:\n\n$$\na = d \\cdot \\theta \\quad \\text{(in AU)}\n$$\n\nWait — yes! There’s a much simpler way using AU and years.\n\n### Revised approach using AU and years\n\nWe know:\n\n- Distance $d = 81.1$ ly = 81.1 / 3.26156 ≈ 24.86 pc\n\n- Angular semi-major axis of star B: $\\theta_B = 3.35$ mas = 3.35 × 10⁻³ arcsec\n\nThen, the physical semi-major axis of star B’s orbit is:\n\n$$\na_B = d \\cdot \\theta_B = 24.86 \\times 3.35 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.08325 \\text{ AU}\n$$\n\nNow, using mass ratio $q = m_A/m_B = 1.026$, so $a_A = a_B / q = 0.08325 / 1.026 ≈ 0.08114$ AU\n\nTotal semi-major axis of relative orbit:\n\n$$\na_{\\text{rel}} = a_A + a_B = 0.08114 + 0.08325 = 0.16439 \\text{ AU}\n$$\n\nPeriod $P = 3.96$ days = 3.96 / 365.25 ≈ 0.01084 years\n\nNow apply Kepler’s Third Law:\n\n$$\nM_1 + M_2 = \\frac{a_{\\text{rel}}^3}{P^2} \\quad \\text{(in solar masses, when } a \\text{ in AU, } P \\text{ in years)}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\na_{\\text{rel}}^3 = (0.16439)^3 ≈ 0.004428\n$$\n\n$$\nP^2 = (0.01084)^2 ≈ 0.0001175\n$$\n\n$$\nM_1 + M_2 = \\frac{0.004428}{0.0001175} ≈ 37.67 \\text{ solar masses}\n$$\n\nSame result as before.\n\nBut is this realistic? Menkalinan is actually a close binary with components of spectral type B5V, which are massive stars. However, 37.7 solar masses is extremely large — even for a binary system. The most massive known stars are around 100–150 M☉, but binary systems with total mass > 30 M☉ are rare.\n\nBut perhaps the numbers given are correct. Let’s check the data again.\n\nThe problem states: “semi-major axis for Menkalinan B was measured to be 3.35 milliarcseconds”. Is that possible?\n\nAt 24.86 pc, an angular separation of 3.35 mas corresponds to:\n\n$$\na = 24.86 \\times 3.35 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.08325 \\text{ AU}\n$$\n\nWhich is about 124 million km — reasonable for a binary with 3.96-day period? Let’s check.\n\nUsing Kepler’s Law for circular orbits:\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{G(M_1 + M_2)}}\n$$\n\nIf total mass were 37.7 M☉, and $a_{\\text{rel}} = 0.164$ AU, then:\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.164)^3}{G \\cdot 37.7 M_\\odot}}\n$$\n\nConvert to SI units:\n\n$a = 0.164 \\times 1.496 \\times 10^{11} = 2.45 \\times 10^{10}$ m\n\n$M = 37.7 \\times 1.9885 \\times 10^{30} = 7.49 \\times 10^{31}$ kg\n\n$G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nT = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{(2.45 \\times 10^{10})^3}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\cdot 7.49 \\times 10^{31}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1.47 \\times 10^{31}}{4.99 \\times 10^{21}}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{2.94 \\times 10^9} = 2\\pi \\times 5.42 \\times 10^4 \\approx 3.40 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s} \\approx 3.93 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nMatches the given period! So the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, despite seeming large, the total mass is indeed approximately 37.7 solar masses.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n37.7 solar masses."",

18,"In the following problem the fluid mechanics of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS) is studied based on the velocity field data.<image>JSTL-Fig-18</image>As shown in the figure shows a map of relative velocity for GRS and the surrounding region. The arrows are oriented and scaled as per the directions and magnitudes of winds at different points.

Due to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, Jupiter is slightly flattened at its poles. The equation of a spheroid approximating for the shape of Jupiter can be stated as:$\begin{aligned}\frac{x^2+y^2}{R_e^2}+\frac{z^2}{R_p^2}=1,\end{aligned}$

where $R_{e}=7.15\times10^{7}$ m is the equatorial radius of Jupiter, and $R_{p}=6.69\times10^{7}$ m the polar radius. The radii of curvature of this spheroid in any direction can be calculated by the following equations $(\epsilon={\frac{R_{e}}{R_{p}}})$: 

$r(\phi)=R_{e}\left(1+\epsilon^{-2}\tan^{2}\phi\right)^{-1/2}$

$R(\phi)=R_{e}\epsilon^{-2}\left(\frac{r(\phi)}{R_{e}\cos\phi}\right)^{3}$

where $r$ and $R$ are the zonal (aka in the zone of a particular latitude) and meridional (aka longitudinal) radii of curvature, respectively, as a function of planetographic latitude $\phi.$ The sidereal rotation period of Jupiter is $P=3.57\times10^{4}$ s.

  ""solution"": ""To calculate the zonal and meridional radii of curvature at the center of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS), we need to determine the planetographic latitude $\\phi$ of the GRS from the provided figure, then use the given formulas for $r(\\phi)$ and $R(\\phi)$ with the known values of $R_e$, $R_p$, and $\\epsilon = R_e / R_p$.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the latitude of the GRS center\nFrom the figure:\n- The vertical axis is labeled \""Latitude (degrees)\"", ranging from -26° to -16°.\n- The horizontal axis is \""West Longitude (degrees)\"", ranging from -15° to 10°.\n- The GRS appears as a large oval structure centered approximately at latitude **-22°** (midway between -24° and -20°) and longitude around **-5°**.\n\nThus, we take the planetographic latitude of the GRS center as:\n$$\n\\phi = -22^\\circ\n$$\n(Note: Since the formulas depend on $\\tan^2\\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi$, the sign does not affect the result, as these are even functions in magnitude.
