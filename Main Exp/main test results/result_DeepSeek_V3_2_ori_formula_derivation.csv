Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Restating the setup**

We have a system of \( N \) particles (molecules, stars, etc.).  
For particle \( i \):

- Mass \( m_i \)
- Position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \) relative to a chosen origin
- Resultant force \( \mathbf{F}_i \) acting on it

The **virial** is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

We want to relate this to kinetic/potential energy via Newton’s second law.

---

## **Step 2: Newton’s second law**

Newton’s second law for particle \( i \):

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

So:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

---

## **Step 3: Relating \( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) to kinetic energy**

Consider the time derivative of \( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

That is:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

So:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - v_i^2
\]

---

## **Step 4: Virial expression in terms of time derivatives**

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - v_i^2 \right]
\]

Sum over all particles:

\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_i m_i \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - \sum_i m_i v_i^2
\]

The second term is \( -2 \sum_i \frac12 m_i v_i^2 = -2K \), where \( K \) is the total kinetic energy.

So:

\[
\mathcal{V} = \frac{d}{dt} \sum_i m_i \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - 2K
\]

---

## **Step 5: Time average for a bound system**

For a **bound system in a steady state** (or over a long time), the time average of the first term over a long period \( T \) tends to zero if the system is periodic or confined (positions and velocities bounded):

\[
\left\langle \frac{d}{dt} \sum_i m_i (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) \right\rangle_T 
= \frac{1}{T} \left[ \sum_i m_i (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) \right]_{t=0}^{t=T}
\]

For large \( T \), if the system doesn’t expand without bound, the quantity \( \sum_i m_i (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) \) is bounded, so the average of its time derivative → 0 as \( T \to \infty \).

Thus, taking a long-time average:

\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
\]

---

## **Step 6: Relating virial to potential energy**

If the forces are **conservative** and derived from a potential \( U(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N) \) that is a homogeneous function of coordinates, we can use Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions.

For gravitational systems (or inverse-square law central forces), \( U \) is homogeneous of degree \( -1 \) in coordinates (since \( U \propto 1/r \)).

More generally, if \( U \) is homogeneous of degree \( n \) in coordinates (meaning \( U(\lambda \mathbf{r}_1, \dots) = \lambda^n U(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots) \)), then:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = n U
\]

But \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), so:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = - \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -n U
\]

Thus \( \mathcal{V} = -n U \).

For gravity: \( n = -1 \), so \( \mathcal{V} = -(-1)U = U \).

---

## **Step 7: Virial theorem for gravitational systems**

From Step 5: \( \langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle \).  
From Step 6: \( \mathcal{V} = U \) for gravity.

So:

\[
\langle U \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
\]

Or:

\[
2 \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
\]

For total energy \( E = K + U \), we get:

\[
\langle E \rangle = \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = -\langle K \rangle = \frac12 \langle U \rangle
\]

---

## **Final formula of the virial theorem (mechanical version)**

For a system in equilibrium under conservative forces homogeneous of degree \( n \):

\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
\]
\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = n \langle U \rangle
\]
\[
2 \langle K \rangle + n \langle U \rangle = 0
\]

For gravity (\( n = -1 \)):

\[
\boxed{2 \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0}
\]

This is the form used in astrophysics to estimate masses of galaxies/clusters from observed velocities and positions."

\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Substitute \( m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) from the EOM:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
\]

This is a double sum over all ordered pairs \( i \neq j \).  
For each pair \( (i,j) \) with \( i \neq j \), there are two terms in the double sum:

- From \( i \) fixed, \( j \) varying: term proportional to \( \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j \).
- From \( j \) fixed, \( i \) varying: term proportional to \( \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i \).

Let’s write the double sum explicitly:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
\]
where \( r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| \).

Now note: \( \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{r_{ij}^3} \) is antisymmetric in \( i \) and \( j \), and \( m_i m_j \) is symmetric.  
So for each unordered pair \( \{i,j\} \), the sum over ordered pairs gives:

\[
\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = 0.
\]

Thus \( \dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \).

So **first integral**:

\[
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}.
\]

---

## **3. Center of mass motion**

Define center of mass position:

\[
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i.
\]

From \( \dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \), we have \( \mathbf{P} = M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \text{const} \).

Integrate:

\[
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t.
\]

So **center of mass moves with constant velocity**.

---

## **4. Total angular momentum conservation**

Define total angular momentum about the origin:

\[
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Differentiate:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Substitute \( m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \):

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
\]

Factor constants:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \, \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Note \( \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i = 0 \), so:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \, \left[ -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j \right].
\]

Thus:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \, (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Again, consider unordered pairs \( \{i,j\} \).  
For a given unordered pair, the ordered pairs \( (i,j) \) and \( (j,i) \) contribute:

\[
\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i).
\]

But \( \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j \), so the sum is zero.

Thus \( \dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0 \).

So **second first integral**:

\[
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}.
\]

---

## **5. Total energy conservation**

Define total kinetic energy:

\[
T = \frac12 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2.
\]

Potential energy for Newtonian gravity:

\[
U = -\sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}}.
\]

The force on \( i \) is \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U \), where \( \nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} \) is gradient w.r.t \( \mathbf{r}_i \).

Check:  
For \( i < j \), \( r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| \),  
\[
\frac{\partial r_{ij}}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} = \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{r_{ij}}, \quad \frac{\partial r_{ij}}{\partial \mathbf{r}_j} = \frac{\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i}{r_{ij}}.
\]

So  
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} \left( -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right) = \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{r_{ij}} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

But in \( U \), each pair \( (i,j) \) appears once with \( i<j \).  
The force on \( i \) due to \( j \) from \( U \) is \( -\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U \) for that pair, which gives \( -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \), matching the EOM.

Now compute \( \frac{d}{dt}(T+U) \):

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

From EOM: \( m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U \).

So  
\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (-\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U) = -\sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U.
\]

But \( \frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N (\nabla_{\mathbf{r}_i} U) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \).

Thus \( \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0 \).

So **third first integral**:

\[
E = T + U = \frac12 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} = \text{constant}.
\]

---

## **6. Summary of first integrals**

From the \( N \)-body gravitational equations:

1. **Total linear momentum** \( \mathbf{P} = \sum m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) — 3 constants.
2. **Center of mass uniform motion** \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t \) — 6 constants (initial \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} \) and \( \mathbf{P} \)), but \( \mathbf{P} \) already counted; actually \( \mathbf{P} \) (3) and initial \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} \) (3) give 6 integrals, but \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) \) is not all independent of \( \mathbf{P} \) in value at a given time; better: constants are \( \mathbf{P} \) and \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) \), so 6 scalar constants.
3. **Total angular momentum** \( \mathbf{L} = \sum m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) — 3 constants.
4. **Total energy** \( E \) — 1 constant.

That’s \( 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 \) classical time-independent integrals for the system (since \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) \) is related to \( \mathbf{P} \) by initial conditions, but \( \mathbf{P} \) and \( \mathbf{L} \) and \( E \) are the traditional ones; actually \( \mathbf{P} \) (3), \( \mathbf{L} \) (3), \( E \) (1) = 7 integrals; the CM uniform motion is a consequence of \( \mathbf{P} \) const).

---

\[
\boxed{\mathbf{P},\ \mathbf{L},\ E}
\]
These are the classical first integrals: total momentum, total angular momentum, and total energy."
9,"Try to prove that, for a celestial body in elliptical motion, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are respectively

Equation (i): For an elliptical orbit, when $f=0$ (periapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its minimum value: $r_{P}=\frac{p}{1+e}=a(1-e)$

Equation (ii): When $f=\pi$ (apoapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its maximum value: $r_{A}=\frac{p}{1-e}=a(1+e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

According to: 

From the vis-viva equation  $v=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}$

Conclude: 

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{P}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1-e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"Alright — let’s go step-by-step.  

---

## **1. Known facts for elliptical motion**

For a body of mass \( m \) orbiting a much larger mass \( M \) under Newtonian gravity:

- **Gravitational parameter** \( \mu = G(M+m) \), often approximated as \( \mu = GM \) if \( m \ll M \).
- **Ellipse geometry**: semi-major axis \( a \), eccentricity \( e \).
- **Aphelion distance** \( r_A = a(1+e) \).
- **Perihelion distance** \( r_P = a(1-e) \).
- **Specific angular momentum** \( h \) is constant:  
\[
h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \sqrt{\mu a (1-e^2)}
\]
- **Specific orbital energy** \( \mathcal{E} \) is constant:
\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\]

---

## **2. Use energy equation at aphelion and perihelion**

At any point in the orbit:
\[
\frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\]
\[
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
This is the **vis-viva equation**.

---

### **At aphelion** \( r_A = a(1+e) \):
\[
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1+e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1+e} - 1 \right)
\]
\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1+e)}{1+e} \right)
\]
\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1-e}{1+e} \right)
\]
\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}
\]

---

### **At perihelion** \( r_P = a(1-e) \):
\[
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1-e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1-e} - 1 \right)
\]
\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1-e)}{1-e} \right)
\]
\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1+e}{1-e} \right)
\]
\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
\]

---

## **3. Alternative check via angular momentum conservation**

Angular momentum per unit mass:
\[
h = r_A v_A = r_P v_P
\]
Also \( h^2 = \mu a (1-e^2) \).

From \( r_A v_A = h \):
\[
v_A = \frac{h}{r_A} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu a (1-e^2)}}{a(1+e)}
\]
\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}}{1+e}
\]
Since \( \sqrt{1-e^2} = \sqrt{(1-e)(1+e)} \):
\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \frac{\sqrt{(1-e)(1+e)}}{1+e}
\]
\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}
\]
Matches.

Similarly for \( v_P \):
\[
v_P = \frac{h}{r_P} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu a (1-e^2)}}{a(1-e)}
\]
\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \frac{\sqrt{(1-e)(1+e)}}{1-e}
\]
\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
\]
Matches.

---

## **4. Conclusion**

We have derived both formulas using either the vis-viva equation or angular momentum conservation.

\[
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}}
\]
\[
\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}}

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have:

- A **very long cylindrical planet** → we treat it as an infinite cylinder of radius \( R \) and uniform density \( \rho \).
- A **satellite** orbiting around the cylinder’s axis, at a distance \( d \) from the center.
- Need: **Relation between orbital period \( P \) and \( d \)**.

---

## **2. Gravitational field of an infinite cylinder**

For an infinite cylinder of radius \( R \) with uniform density \( \rho \), the gravitational field outside (\( d > R \)) can be found using Gauss’s law for gravity.

Gauss’s law for gravity:

\[
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]

Here \( g \) is gravitational acceleration magnitude (radially inward for a cylinder).

---

### **2.1 Outside the cylinder (\( d > R \))**

Choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius \( d \) and length \( L \), coaxial with the planet.

Mass enclosed:

\[
M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot \text{Volume} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)
\]

Gauss’s law:

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
\]

The minus sign indicates inward direction; we take magnitude:

\[
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d} \cdot \frac{?}{?}
\]

Let’s compute carefully:

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]
Actually, Gauss’s law: \(\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}\).  
For radial inward \( \vec{g} \), \( \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -g \, dA \) if \( d\vec{A} \) is outward normal.  
So:

\[
-g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]
Cancel minus signs:

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]
\[
g = \frac{4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}}{2\pi d L}
\]
\[
g = \frac{2 G M_{\text{enc}}}{d L}
\]
But \( M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \pi R^2 L \), so:

\[
g = \frac{2 G (\rho \pi R^2 L)}{d L}
\]
\[
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\]

So for \( d > R \):

\[
g(d) = \frac{2 G \lambda}{d}
\]
where \( \lambda = \rho \pi R^2 \) is mass per unit length.

---

### **2.2 Inside the cylinder (\( d < R \))**

For \( d < R \):

\[
M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi d^2 L)
\]
Gauss’s law:

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G (\rho \pi d^2 L)
\]
\[
g = \frac{4\pi G \rho \pi d^2 L}{2\pi d L}
\]
\[
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho \, d
\]

---

## **3. Satellite orbit**

Satellite orbits in a circle of radius \( d \) around the axis.  
Centripetal acceleration: \( a_c = \frac{v^2}{d} = g(d) \).

Orbital speed \( v = \frac{2\pi d}{P} \), where \( P \) is the period.

So:

\[
\frac{(2\pi d / P)^2}{d} = g(d)
\]
\[
\frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2} = g(d)
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{g(d)}
\]

---

## **4. Two cases**

### **Case 1: Satellite outside cylinder (\( d > R \))**

\[
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}}
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2}
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
\]

So:

\[
P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
\]

---

### **Case 2: Satellite inside cylinder (\( d < R \))**

\[
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho d
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{2\pi G \rho d}
\]
\[
P^2 = \frac{2\pi}{G \rho}
\]

Interesting: \( P \) is **independent of \( d \)** inside the cylinder!

\[
P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}
\]

---

## **5. Final answer**

For \( d < R \):

\[
P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}
\]

For \( d > R \):

\[
P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
\]

Or combined:

\[
P^2 = \frac{2\pi}{G\rho} \times 
\begin{cases}
1, & d \le R \\
\frac{d^2}{R^2}, & d > R
\end{cases}
\]

---

\[
\boxed{P^2 = \frac{2\pi}{G\rho} \times \max\left(1, \frac{d^2}{R^2}\right)}
\]

This is the expression relating period \( P \) to distance \( d \) for a satellite orbiting an infinite cylindrical planet of radius \( R \) and density \( \rho \)."
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

According to: 

The velocity distribution in an elliptical galaxy is uniform and random. Then, we can use the Virial theorem ($T=-U/2$) to calculate the velocity at the edge of the galaxy.

Conclude: 

$1/2Mv_{tot}^{2}=\frac{3}{10}\frac{GM^{2}}{R}\Longrightarrow M=\frac{5}{3}\frac{v_{tot}^{2}R}{G}$

Where $v_{tot}$ is the total magnitude of the velocity (in tangential and nontangential directions). 

According to: 

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have two galaxies, both of radius \( R \).

- **Galaxy A**: Spiral → rotation-supported.  
  At \( r = R \) (edge of galaxy), rotational velocity \( v_{\text{rot}} = v \).

- **Galaxy B**: Spherical elliptical, uniform density, supported by **velocity dispersion** (random motions).  
  At \( r = R \), radial velocity dispersion \( \sigma_r = v \).

We are to **calculate the masses** of both galaxies.

---

## **2. Galaxy A (spiral, rotation curve)**

For a spiral galaxy, at large \( r \) (outside most of the mass concentration), rotation velocity is given by Newtonian gravity for a spherical mass distribution:

\[
v_{\text{rot}}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{G M(r)}{r}}
\]

Here, at \( r = R \), \( v_{\text{rot}}(R) = v \), so:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M_A}{R}}
\]

where \( M_A \) is the **total mass** inside radius \( R \) (since \( R \) is the galaxy’s radius, all mass is inside \( R \)).

Solving for \( M_A \):

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M_A}{R}
\]
\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

---

## **3. Galaxy B (uniform density sphere, velocity dispersion)**

Galaxy B is spherical, uniform density \( \rho \), radius \( R \), composed of stars in equilibrium, supported by random motions (isotropic velocity dispersion).  
For such a system, the **virial theorem** applies.

For a uniform sphere of mass \( M_B \) and radius \( R \):

- Gravitational potential energy:
\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]
(Classical result for uniform sphere.)

- For isotropic velocities, the kinetic energy \( K \) is:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle
\]
where \( \langle v^2 \rangle \) is the mean-square speed averaged over all stars.

---

**But** the given information is: at \( r = R \), the **radial velocity dispersion** \( \sigma_r(R) = v \).

For a uniform sphere with isotropic velocities, \( \sigma_r(r) \) is **not** constant with \( r \), but we can relate the **global** mean-square speed to the total mass using the virial theorem.

---

### **3.1 Virial theorem for uniform sphere**

Virial theorem: \( 2K + U = 0 \) for equilibrium.

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0
\]
\[
M_B \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]
\[
\langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}
\]

---

### **3.2 Relating \( \langle v^2 \rangle \) to \( \sigma_r(R) \)**

For isotropic velocities, \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \langle v_r^2 \rangle \), where \( \langle v_r^2 \rangle \) is the **mass-weighted average over entire sphere** of radial velocity dispersion squared.

But here \( \sigma_r(R) \) is measured **at \( r = R \)** only. For a uniform sphere, the Jeans equation for isotropic case gives:

\[
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
\]
For uniform \( \rho \), \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho r^3 \), so:
\[
\frac{d(\sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\frac{G}{r^2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho r^3 \cdot \frac{1}{\rho} \quad\text{(Wait, careful)}
\]
Actually: \( \rho \) constant, isotropic \( \sigma_r^2 = \sigma^2 \) possibly depends on \( r \).

Jeans eqn: \( \frac{d (\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} + \frac{2\beta \rho \sigma_r^2}{r} = -\rho \frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \), with \( \beta = 0 \) for isotropic.

So:
\[
\frac{d \sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
\]
\[
M(r) = \frac{M_B}{R^3} r^3
\]
\[
\frac{d \sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M_B r}{R^3}
\]
Integrate:
\[
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3}
\]

Boundary condition: \( \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 \) given.

Also, physical requirement: \( \sigma_r^2(0) \) finite, but we can determine it from total kinetic energy.

Better: compute \( \langle v^2 \rangle \) directly from \( \sigma_r^2(r) \) and compare with virial \( \langle v^2 \rangle \) formula.

---

Mass-weighted average of \( \sigma_r^2 \):

\[
\langle v_r^2 \rangle_{\text{mass}} = \frac{\int_0^R \rho \cdot 4\pi r^2 \sigma_r^2(r) \, dr}{M_B}
\]
But \( \sigma_r^2(r) \) unknown without BC. Actually, from Jeans integration above, we have one free parameter \( \sigma_r^2(0) \). Let’s determine it from \( \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
\]
So:
\[
\sigma_r^2(0) = v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
\]

Now compute \( \langle v_r^2 \rangle \):

\[
\langle v_r^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{M_B} \int_0^R \left[ v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R} - \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3} \right] \rho \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr
\]
Let \( \rho = \frac{3 M_B}{4\pi R^3} \), \( M_B \) cancels partly.

Compute term by term:

First term: \( \int_0^R v^2 \rho 4\pi r^2 dr = v^2 M_B \).

Second term: \( \int_0^R \frac{G M_B}{2 R} \rho 4\pi r^2 dr = \frac{G M_B}{2 R} \cdot M_B \).

Third term: \( -\int_0^R \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3} \rho 4\pi r^2 dr \).

Compute third: \( \rho 4\pi = \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} \), so integrand: \( -\frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} \cdot \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} r^4 \) — wait carefully:

Actually:  
Third term inside integral: \( -\frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3} \times \rho 4\pi r^2 dr \)  
\( \rho 4\pi = \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} \)  
So: \( -\frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} \cdot \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} r^4 dr \)  
= \( -\frac{3 G M_B^2}{2 R^6} r^4 dr \)

Integrate \( \int_0^R r^4 dr = R^5/5 \), so third term total = \( -\frac{3 G M_B^2}{2 R^6} \cdot \frac{R^5}{5} = -\frac{3 G M_B^2}{10 R} \).

So:
\[
\langle v_r^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{M_B} \left[ v^2 M_B + \frac{G M_B^2}{2 R} - \frac{3 G M_B^2}{10 R} \right]
\]
\[
= v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R} - \frac{3 G M_B}{10 R}
\]
\[
= v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{5 R}
\]

---

### **3.3 Using isotropy \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \langle v_r^2 \rangle \)**

From earlier virial: \( \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} \).

So:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} = 3 \left( v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{5 R} \right)
\]
\[
\frac{G M_B}{5 R} = v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{5 R}
\]
This gives \( 0 = v^2 \) — contradiction unless I made an algebra slip.

Let’s check:  
From virial: \( \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} \).  
From Jeans + given \( \sigma_r(R) = v \): \( \langle v_r^2 \rangle = v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{5 R} \).  
Isotropy: \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \langle v_r^2 \rangle \).

So:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} = 3 v^2 + \frac{3 G M_B}{5 R}
\]
Cancel \( \frac{3 G M_B}{5 R} \) from both sides → \( 0 = 3 v^2 \) → \( v = 0 \) — impossible unless no dispersion at edge, which is not true for uniform sphere.

This means: **For a uniform sphere with isotropic velocities, \( \sigma_r(R) \) cannot be arbitrarily chosen independent of mass** — it’s determined uniquely by \( M_B, R \). In fact, solving Jeans eqn for uniform sphere with isotropic \( \beta=0 \) and \( \sigma_r^2(R) = 0 \) (common boundary) gives a certain profile. But here \( \sigma_r(R) = v \) is given, so \( M_B \) is fixed.

Let’s solve directly from Jeans eqn without using virial average mismatch:

---

Jeans: \( \frac{d \sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \), \( M(r) = \frac{M_B r^3}{R^3} \).

So:
\[
\frac{d \sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M_B r}{R^3}
\]
Integrate:
\[
\sigma_r^2(r) = C - \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3}
\]
Given \( \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 \):
\[
v^2 = C - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
\]
So \( C = v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R} \).

Now, \( \sigma_r^2(0) = C \).

We can determine \( M_B \) by **virial theorem** applied to this σ² profile.

Kinetic energy \( K = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho (3 \sigma_r^2(r)) \, dV \) because isotropy: \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2(r) \) locally.

So:
\[
K = \frac{3}{2} \int_0^R \rho \sigma_r^2(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{2} \rho \int_0^R \left[ v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R} - \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3} \right] 4\pi r^2 dr
\]
But \( \rho 4\pi = 3 M_B / R^3 \).

So:
\[
K = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} \int_0^R \left[ v^2 + \frac{G M_B}{2 R} - \frac{G M_B r^2}{2 R^3} \right] r^2 dr
\]

Compute integral:  
Term1: \( \int_0^R v^2 r^2 dr = v^2 R^3/3 \)  
Term2: \( \int_0^R \frac{G M_B}{2 R} r^2 dr = \frac{G M_B}{2 R} \cdot \frac{R^3}{3} \)  
Term3: \( -\int_0^R \frac{G M_B r^4}{2 R^3} dr = -\frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} \cdot \frac{R^5}{5} \)

So:
\[
\int_0^R [\cdots] r^2 dr = \frac{v^2 R^3}{3} + \frac{G M_B R^2}{6} - \frac{G M_B R^2}{10}
\]
\[
= \frac{v^2 R^3}{3} + \frac{G M_B R^2}{15}
\]

Multiply by \( \frac{3 M_B}{R^3} \):
\[
\frac{3 M_B}{R^3} \times \left[ \frac{v^2 R^3}{3} + \frac{G M_B R^2}{15} \right] = M_B v^2 + \frac{G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Now \( K = \frac{3}{2} \times \left[ M_B v^2 + \frac{G M_B^2}{5 R} \right] \).

Virial: \( 2K + U = 0 \), \( U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} \).

So:
\[
3\left[ M_B v^2 + \frac{G M_B^2}{5 R} \right] - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0
\]
\[
3 M_B v^2 + \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R} - \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R} = 0
\]
\[
3 M_B v^2 = 0
\]
Again \( v=0 \) — contradiction.

This means: **The given condition \( \sigma_r(R) = v \) for uniform isotropic sphere is inconsistent with equilibrium unless \( v \) is exactly the value from the known solution**.

Known solution for uniform isotropic sphere: solve Jeans with \( \sigma_r^2(R) = 0 \) (tracer population finite at boundary). Then \( C = G M_B/(2R) \), so \( \sigma_r^2(0) = G M_B/(2R) \). Mass-weighted mean \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \times \) (mass-avg σ_r²) = \( 3 \times (G M_B/(5R)) \)?? Let’s recall standard result:

Actually, known: For uniform sphere, isotropic, \( \sigma_r^2(r) = \frac{G M_B}{2R} \left[ 1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right] \).

Check: \( \sigma_r^2(R) = 0 \), \( \sigma_r^2(0) = \frac{G M_B}{2R} \).

Then \( \langle v_r^2 \rangle_{\text{mass}} = \frac{1}{M_B} \int \rho \sigma_r^2(r) dV = \frac{G M_B}{5R} \).

So \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \langle v_r^2 \rangle = \frac{3 G M_B}{5 R} \) — matches virial.

Thus, if we impose \( \sigma_r(R) = v \), then \( v \) must be 0 for consistency with isotropic uniform sphere. But here \( v \) is given same as rotation speed of Galaxy A, nonzero. So Galaxy B **cannot** be uniform isotropic with \( \sigma_r(R) = v \) unless we interpret \( \sigma_r(R) \) as some kind of average? Possibly they mean **the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion at projected R** is v, which for uniform sphere is not zero.

Given the contradiction, maybe the problem intends:  
For Galaxy B, the **global** velocity dispersion σ (rms 3D speed) satisfies \( \sigma_{\text{3D}}^2 = \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2 \) at some point? Or they mean σ_r is constant with r (isothermal) but uniform density not isothermal.

Given the complexity, perhaps the intended simple answer uses scalar virial theorem with \( \sigma_{\text{1D}}^2 = v^2 \) as the global mean squared 1D dispersion.

---

### **3.4 Simpler intended approach**

Often in such problems:  
For isotropic spherical system, virial theorem:  
\[
M_B = \frac{5 \langle \sigma_{\text{1D}}^2 \rangle R}{G}
\]
where \( \langle \sigma_{\text{1D}}^2 \rangle \) is luminosity-weighted average of squared line-of-sight velocity dispersion.

If they say “radial velocity dispersion = v at r=R” and assume that’s typical, maybe they take \( \langle \sigma_{\text{1D}}^2 \rangle \approx v^2 \), so:

\[
M_B \approx \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
\]

Comparing with \( M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \), we get \( M_B = 5 M_A \).

---

## **4. Final masses**

From rotation:  
\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

From velocity dispersion (assuming uniform sphere, using virial with σ"
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have two pressures:

1. **Electron degeneracy pressure** (non-relativistic, from Fermi gas model):

\[
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
\]
where \( n \) = number density of electrons.

2. **Gravitational pressure**:

\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
\]
So:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{3V} \left( -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \right) = \frac{GM^2}{5R} \cdot \frac{1}{V}
\]
But \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \), so \( 1/V = \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} \).

Thus:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GM^2}{5R} \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}.
\]

---

## **2. Relating \( n \) to mass density \( \rho \)**

The star contains nuclei with atomic number \( Z \) and mass number \( A \).

Let \( m_p \) = proton mass, \( m_n \approx m_p \) = neutron mass.  
Mass of one nucleus ≈ \( A m_p \) (approximately, ignoring binding energy).

Number density of nuclei = \( n_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{\rho}{A m_p} \).

Each nucleus has \( Z \) electrons, so:

\[
n = Z \, n_{\text{nuclei}} = Z \frac{\rho}{A m_p}.
\]

---

## **3. Pressure balance**

At equilibrium:
\[
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}.
\]

So:
\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}.
\]

---

## **4. Express \( R \) in terms of \( M \) and \( \rho \)**

Mass \( M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho \) ⇒ \( R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \), so \( R^4 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \right)^{4/3} \).

Also \( n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p} \).

---

## **5. Substitute \( n \) and \( R \) into pressure balance**

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3}.
\]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{R^4} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi\rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3}.
\]

Simplify \( p_g \):

\[
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \frac{\rho^{4/3}}{M^{4/3}}.
\]

\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2 - 4/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

\[
M^{2 - 4/3} = M^{2/3}.
\]

So:
\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

---

## **6. Equate \( p_e = p_g \)**

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

Divide both sides by \( \rho^{4/3} \):

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **7. Solve for \( \rho \)**

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} }.
\]

Simplify constants:  
Factor \( \frac{3G}{20\pi} \) divided by \( \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} \) = \( \frac{3G}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \).

So:

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **8. Simplify the \( \pi \) factors**

First, \( (3\pi^2)^{2/3} = 3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3} \).

Second, \( \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} = \frac{(4\pi)^{4/3}}{3^{4/3}} = \frac{4^{4/3} \pi^{4/3}}{3^{4/3}} \).

So ratio:

\[
\frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } = \frac{ 4^{4/3} \pi^{4/3} / 3^{4/3} }{ 3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3} } = \frac{4^{4/3}}{3^{4/3} \cdot 3^{2/3}} = \frac{4^{4/3}}{3^{2}}.
\]

Since \( 4^{4/3} = (2^2)^{4/3} = 2^{8/3} \), and \( 3^2 = 9 \), we have \( \frac{2^{8/3}}{9} \).

---

## **9. Put it together**

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{2^{8/3}}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{G m_e}{12\pi \hbar^2} \cdot 2^{8/3} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **10. Cube both sides to get \( \rho \)**

\[
\rho = \left[ \frac{G m_e}{12\pi \hbar^2} \cdot 2^{8/3} \right]^3 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2.
\]

\[
\left( 2^{8/3} \right)^3 = 2^{8} = 256.
\]

\[
\left( \frac{G m_e}{12\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 = \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{(12\pi)^3 \hbar^6}.
\]

So:

\[
\boxed{\rho = \frac{256}{ (12\pi)^3 } \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2 }
\]

---

**Final check:**  
Units: \( G^3 m_e^3 / \hbar^6 \) has dimensions \( (M^{-1}L^3T^{-2})^3 \cdot M^3 / (ML^2T^{-1})^6 \) → simplifies to \( M^0 L^{-9} T^0 \), so \( 1/\text{length}^9 \).  
Multiply by \( (A m_p/Z)^5 \) → \( M^5 L^{-15} T^0 \), multiply by \( M^2 \) → \( M^7 L^{-15} T^0 \).  
But \( \rho \) is \( M L^{-3} \), so we need \( M^6 L^{-12} \) from constants? Let’s check: \( m_p^5 m_e^3 \) mass^8, \( G^3 \) mass^{-3} length^9 time^{-6}, \( \hbar^{-6} \) mass^{-6} length^{-12} time^{6} → total mass^{-1} length^{-3} time^0. Then \( M^2 \) mass^2 gives mass^1 length^{-3} → correct.

So formula is dimensionally consistent.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\rho = \frac{256}{(12\pi)^3} \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2.
\]"
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

Conclude: 

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{m}_2) = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2}{r^3} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2}{r^3}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Write down the given formulas**

Magnetic field at position \(\vec{r}\) due to dipole \(\vec{m}_1\):

\[
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
\]

Potential energy of dipole \(\vec{m}_2\) in an external field \(\vec{B}\):

\[
U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}
\]

Here, \(\vec{B}\) is the field produced by \(\vec{m}_1\) at the location of \(\vec{m}_2\).

So:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1
\]

---

## **Step 2: Substitute \(\vec{B}_1\) into \(U_{\text{int}}\)**

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
\]

Factor constants out:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right) \right]
\]

---

## **Step 3: Expand the dot product**

\[
\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
= 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1
\]

Thus:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]
\]

---

## **Step 4: Final expression**

\[
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]
\]

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
\]

This is the classical dipole-dipole interaction energy for two magnetic dipoles separated by \(\vec{r} = r\hat{r}\)."

The potential energy of the electron.

Conclude: 

$V = -\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r},$

the kinetic energy

$K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2}.$

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.  

---

## **1. Understanding the system**
We have:  
- Electron mass \( m_e \)  
- Proton mass \( m_p \)  
- Radius of orbit \( r \) (distance between them)  
- Coulomb attraction: \( F = \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \) (where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \), but we can keep it as \( k \) for now)  
- \( m_p \gg m_e \) means proton is essentially fixed at the center (reduced mass \( \mu \approx m_e \))  

---

## **2. Force balance for circular motion**
For a circular orbit, Coulomb force provides centripetal force for the electron:  

\[
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = m_e \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

where \( v \) is the electron’s orbital speed.

From this:

\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r}
\]
\[
v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}
\]

---

## **3. Kinetic energy**
Electron’s kinetic energy:

\[
K = \frac12 m_e v^2 = \frac12 m_e \cdot \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} = \frac{k e^2}{2r}
\]

---

## **4. Potential energy**
Coulomb potential energy (with zero at infinity):

\[
U = -\frac{k e^2}{r}
\]

---

## **5. Total energy**
\[
E = K + U = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}
\]

So:

\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}}
\]

---

## **6. Orbital angular momentum**
Magnitude of angular momentum of electron about the center (proton):

\[
L = m_e v r
\]

From \( v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \), we have \( v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \).

Thus:

\[
L = m_e \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \cdot r
\]
\[
L = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}
\]

So:

\[
\boxed{L = e \sqrt{k m_e r}}
\]

---

**Final expressions** (using \( k = 1/(4\pi\varepsilon_0) \) if needed in SI units):

\[
E = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 r}, \quad L = e \sqrt{\frac{m_e r}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}}
\]

But in the form with \( k \):

\[
E = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}, \quad L = e \sqrt{k m_e r}

15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"Alright — let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Earth mass \( M \), gravitational constant \( G \).
- Space station mass \( m_2 \) in **circular orbit** of radius \( R \).
- Meteorite mass \( m_1 \) **radially approaching Earth** (so velocity vector is radial inward at collision point).
- Collision happens at radius \( R \) (same as space station’s orbit).
- After collision: meteorite + space station stick together → conglomerate mass \( m_1 + m_2 \).
- Conglomerate moves in a **closed orbit** whose **perigee** (closest approach to Earth’s center) is \( R/2 \).
- We must find:
  1. Shape of conglomerate’s orbit.
  2. (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision.
  3. (ii) Min and max speeds of conglomerate.
  4. (iii) Max distance from Earth’s center.
  5. Condition on \( m_1, m_2 \) for this scenario.

---

## **Step 2: Space station’s speed before collision**

For a circular orbit of radius \( R \):

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]
and its velocity is **tangential** at collision point.

Let’s set coordinates:  
At collision point (\( r = R \)), let space station velocity be in \( +\hat{\theta} \) direction (tangential).  
Meteorite velocity is purely radial inward: \( \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{r} \) (with \( v_1 > 0 \)).

---

## **Step 3: Conservation of momentum at collision**

Collision is **inelastic** (they stick).  
Right after collision, conglomerate velocity \( \vec{V} \) has components \( V_r \) (radial) and \( V_\theta \) (tangential).

Tangential momentum conservation (no external torque at instant of collision):

\[
m_2 v_2 + m_1 \cdot 0 = (m_1 + m_2) V_\theta
\]
So:
\[
V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_2 = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]

Radial momentum conservation:

\[
m_1 (-v_1) + m_2 \cdot 0 = (m_1 + m_2) V_r
\]
So:
\[
V_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1
\]

Thus, just after collision at \( r = R \):

\[
\vec{V} = \left( -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1, \; \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right) \quad \text{(in polar coords: radial, tangential)}
\]

---

## **Step 4: Shape of conglomerate’s orbit**

We are told: after collision, conglomerate is in a **closed orbit** with perigee \( r_{\min} = R/2 \).  
Since perigee < \( R \) and collision point is at \( r = R \), the orbit is an **ellipse** with Earth at one focus, and \( R \) is either apogee or some intermediate point.

Given \( V_r \neq 0 \) at \( r = R \), \( R \) is **not** apogee unless \( V_r = 0 \) there. Here \( V_r < 0 \) (inward radial), so at \( r = R \) the conglomerate is **moving inward** toward perigee \( R/2 \).  
Thus \( R \) is **not** the apogee; apogee will be > \( R \).

So orbit is elliptical with perigee \( R/2 \) and apogee \( r_{\max} > R \).

---

## **Step 5: Using orbital mechanics constants**

For the conglomerate mass \( m = m_1 + m_2 \), the reduced mass concept isn’t needed here because \( m \ll M \), so the motion around Earth is independent of \( m \).  
We can analyze using specific orbital energy and angular momentum **per unit mass** of the conglomerate.

Let:
\[
\mu = GM
\]
(standard gravitational parameter).

At \( r = R \), just after collision:

Specific angular momentum \( h = r V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \):

\[
h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
\]

Specific orbital energy \( \mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} (V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{GM}{r} \):

\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2 \right] - \frac{GM}{R}
\]

---

## **Step 6: Relating to known perigee \( r_p = R/2 \)**

For Keplerian orbit:
\[
r_p = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 + e}, \quad r_a = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 - e}
\]
and \( \mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mu}{2a} \), \( a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} \).

From \( r_p = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 + e} \), we get:
\[
\frac{h^2}{\mu} = r_p (1 + e) = \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
\]
Also \( r_a = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 - e} = \frac{\frac{R}{2}(1+e)}{1 - e} \).

We don’t yet know \( e \), but we can find \( h \) from earlier.

---

## **Step 7: Determine \( v_1 \) from perigee condition**

At perigee \( r_p = R/2 \), the radial velocity is zero, so \( h = r_p v_{p,\text{max}} \). But maybe easier: use **vis-viva** and angular momentum conservation between \( r = R \) and \( r = R/2 \).

Better: Use the **perigee distance formula** from the energy and angular momentum at \( r = R \):

The radial velocity in orbit:  
\[
V_r^2 = 2 \left( \mathcal{E} + \frac{\mu}{r} \right) - \frac{h^2}{r^2}
\]
At perigee \( r_p \), \( V_r = 0 \), so:
\[
\frac{h^2}{r_p^2} = 2 \left( \mathcal{E} + \frac{\mu}{r_p} \right)
\]
But also \( \mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h^2}{r_p^2} - \frac{\mu}{r_p} \) from rearranging.

Actually, known relation:  
For given \( h \) and \( \mathcal{E} \), the perigee and apogee are roots of:
\[
\frac{h^2}{2 r^2} - \frac{\mu}{r} - \mathcal{E} = 0
\]
i.e.:
\[
\mathcal{E} r^2 + \mu r - \frac{h^2}{2} = 0
\]
Sum of roots \( r_p + r_a = -\mu / \mathcal{E} \), product \( r_p r_a = -h^2 / (2\mathcal{E}) \).

We know \( r_p = R/2 \), \( h \) known in terms of \( m_1, m_2, v_1 \), \( \mathcal{E} \) also in terms of them.

Let’s compute \( h^2 \):

\[
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \), \( \beta = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \), with \( \alpha + \beta = 1 \).

Then:
\[
h = \alpha \sqrt{G M R}
\]
\[
V_\theta = \alpha \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}, \quad V_r = -\beta v_1
\]
\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} (\beta^2 v_1^2 + \alpha^2 \frac{GM}{R}) - \frac{GM}{R}
\]

---

## **Step 8: Equation from perigee condition**

At \( r_p = R/2 \), \( V_r = 0 \), so from energy conservation:

\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h^2}{r_p^2} - \frac{GM}{r_p}
\]
Substitute \( r_p = R/2 \), \( h^2 = \alpha^2 G M R \):

\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\alpha^2 G M R}{(R/2)^2} - \frac{GM}{R/2}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \alpha^2 G M R \cdot \frac{4}{R^2} - \frac{2GM}{R}
\]
\[
= \frac{2 \alpha^2 GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R}
\]
\[
= \frac{2GM}{R} (\alpha^2 - 1)
\]

But \( \alpha^2 - 1 = - (1 - \alpha^2) = - \beta^2 \) since \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 \neq 1 \) actually \( \alpha + \beta =1 \) but squares: \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 + 2\alpha\beta =1 \) so \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1 - 2\alpha\beta \). Let’s keep as is.

So:
\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{2GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2) = -\frac{2GM}{R} \beta^2
\]
Wait, check sign: \( \alpha^2 - 1 = -\beta^2 \), yes. So:
\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{2GM}{R} \cdot (-\beta^2) \cdot ? \] Let’s recalc carefully:

\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{2GM}{R} (\alpha^2 - 1) = \frac{2GM}{R} ( - (1 - \alpha^2) ) = -\frac{2GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2)
\]
But \( 1 - \alpha^2 = \beta^2 + 2\alpha\beta? \) No: \( 1 - \alpha^2 = (1-\alpha)(1+\alpha) = \beta (1+\alpha) \). Not simply \( \beta^2 \). Let’s keep \( 1 - \alpha^2 \).

So:
\[
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{2GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2)
\]

---

## **Step 9: Equate with earlier \( \mathcal{E} \) expression**

Earlier:
\[
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} \beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} \alpha^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{R}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{\alpha^2}{2} - 1 \right)
\]

Set equal to \( -\frac{2GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2) \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{\alpha^2}{2} - 1 \right) = -\frac{2GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2)
\]

Multiply through by 2:
\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2GM}{R} \left( \frac{\alpha^2}{2} - 1 \right) = -\frac{4GM}{R} (1 - \alpha^2)
\]

Simplify \( \frac{2GM}{R} \left( \frac{\alpha^2}{2} - 1 \right) = \frac{GM}{R} (\alpha^2 - 2) \).

So:
\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (\alpha^2 - 2) = -\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{4GM}{R} \alpha^2
\]

Bring terms with \( \alpha^2 \) together:  
\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{GM}{R} \alpha^2 - \frac{2GM}{R} = -\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{4GM}{R} \alpha^2
\]

\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 - \frac{2GM}{R} + \frac{4GM}{R} = \frac{4GM}{R} \alpha^2 - \frac{GM}{R} \alpha^2
\]

\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2GM}{R} = \frac{3GM}{R} \alpha^2
\]

\[
\beta^2 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (3\alpha^2 - 2)
\]

---

## **Step 10: Solve for \( v_1 \)**

\[
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{3\alpha^2 - 2}{\beta^2}
\]
where \( \alpha = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \), \( \beta = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \).

So:
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{3m_2^2/(m_1+m_2)^2 - 2}{m_1^2/(m_1+m_2)^2} }
\]
\[
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1^2} }
\]

Thus:
\[
\boxed{v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1^2}}}
\]
This is **answer (i)**.

---

## **Step 11: Condition for scenario to be possible**

We need \( v_1^2 > 0 \), so:
\[
3m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 > 0
\]
\[
3m_2^2 > 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2)
\]
\[
3m_2^2 > 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 + 2m_2^2
\]
\[
m_2^2 > 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2
\]
\[
0 > 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 - m_2^2
\]
\[
m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 < 0
\]

Treat as quadratic in \( m_2 \):  
Roots: \( m_2 = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{16m_1^2 + 8m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{24 m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4m_1 \pm 2\sqrt{6} m_1}{2} = (2 \pm \sqrt{6}) m_1 \).

Since \( m_2 > 0 \), the inequality \( m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 < 0 \) holds for \( m_2 \) between the roots, but \( 2 - \sqrt{6} < 0 \), so positive root is \( (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.449 m_1 \).

Thus:
\[
m_2 < (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1
\]
Also \( m_2 > 0 \). But also from earlier, \( 3m_2^2 > 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \) ⇒ \( m_2/m_1 > 2+\sqrt{6} \) or \( m_2/m_1 < 2-\sqrt{6} \) (negative, discard). Wait — check inequality direction carefully:

We had \( 3m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 > 0 \).  
Let \( x = m_2/m_1 \). Then \( 3x^2 - 2(1+x)^2 > 0 \) ⇒ \( 3x^2 - 2(1 + 2x + x^2) > 0 \) ⇒ \( 3x^2 - 2 - 4x - 2x^2 > 0 \) ⇒ \( x^2 - 4x - 2 > 0 \).

Roots: \( x = 2 \pm \sqrt{6} \).  
Inequality \( x^2 - 4x - 2 > 0 \) holds for \( x > 2+\sqrt{6} \) or \( x < 2-\sqrt{6} \) (negative). Since \( x > 0 \), we need \( x > 2+\sqrt{6} \).

So:

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We are told:

- Galaxies have a large angular size, so their total light is spread over a large solid angle.
- **Apparent magnitude** \( m \) is a measure of total flux received from the object.
- **Surface magnitude** is magnitude per unit solid angle (e.g., \( \text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2 \)).
- We must show that in a **non-expanding universe**, surface magnitude is **independent of distance**.

---

## **2. Recall definitions**

Let:

- \( L \) = total luminosity of the galaxy (bolometric or in a given band; constant for a given galaxy in a non-expanding universe).
- \( d \) = distance to the galaxy.
- \( F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \) = total flux received from the galaxy.

**Apparent magnitude** \( m \) is related to \( F \) by:

\[
m = -2.5 \log_{10} F + \text{constant}.
\]

---

## **3. Surface brightness in physical terms**

Let’s define **surface brightness** in **astronomer’s intensity units** first.

**Intensity** \( I \) (flux per unit solid angle) is what matters for surface brightness.

For an extended object of **physical surface brightness** \( S \) (luminosity per unit physical area, \( \text{W} \, \text{m}^{-2} \)):

Consider a small patch of the galaxy of **physical area** \( A_{\text{phys}} \) and luminosity \( \Delta L \).  
At distance \( d \), the patch subtends solid angle:

\[
\Delta \Omega = \frac{A_{\text{phys}}}{d^2}.
\]

The flux received from this patch is:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{\Delta L}{4\pi d^2}.
\]

But \( \Delta L = S \cdot A_{\text{phys}} \), where \( S \) is the **physical surface brightness** (constant across the galaxy face, for simplicity).

So:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{S \cdot A_{\text{phys}}}{4\pi d^2}.
\]

---

## **4. Observed intensity (flux per solid angle)**

Observed intensity \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta \Omega}.
\]

Substitute:

\[
\Delta F = \frac{S A_{\text{phys}}}{4\pi d^2}, \quad \Delta \Omega = \frac{A_{\text{phys}}}{d^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
I = \frac{S A_{\text{phys}} / (4\pi d^2)}{A_{\text{phys}} / d^2} = \frac{S}{4\pi}.
\]

**Key result:** \( I \) is **independent of distance** \( d \).

---

## **5. Surface magnitude definition**

Surface magnitude \( \mu \) is magnitude per unit solid angle.  
If \( m \) is total magnitude over solid angle \( \Omega_{\text{total}} \), then:

\[
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10} (\Omega_{\text{total}})
\]
for \( \Omega_{\text{total}} \) in arcsec² or arcmin²? Let’s be careful.

Actually, standard definition:  
If an object of apparent magnitude \( m \) has angular area \( \Omega \) (in square arcsec), then:

\[
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10} (\Omega).
\]

But \( m \) itself depends on distance: \( m \propto 5\log_{10} d \).

---

## **6. Check distance dependence**

Let’s compute \( \mu \) explicitly.

Physical surface brightness \( S \) constant ⇒ \( I \) constant ⇒ \( \mu \) constant.

Why? Because magnitude scale:  
Let \( I \) = flux per solid angle (e.g., W m⁻² sr⁻¹).

Surface magnitude \( \mu \) (in mag/arcsec²) is:

\[
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right),
\]
where \( I_0 \) is a reference intensity for zero point.

From step 4: \( I = S/(4\pi) \) independent of \( d \), so \( \mu \) independent of \( d \).

---

## **7. Alternative derivation using angular size**

Galaxy has physical size \( R \), distance \( d \), angular radius \( \theta \approx R/d \).

Solid angle \( \Omega \approx \pi \theta^2 = \pi R^2 / d^2 \).

Total flux \( F = L/(4\pi d^2) \).

Flux per solid angle:

\[
\frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{L/(4\pi d^2)}{\pi R^2 / d^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi^2 R^2}.
\]

This is independent of \( d \).

Thus surface brightness in flux units \( \propto L/R^2 \) (which is related to \( S \)).

---

## **8. Conclusion**

In a **non-expanding universe**, \( L \) and \( R \) are fixed for a given galaxy, so \( L/R^2 \) is fixed.  
Therefore **flux per unit solid angle** is constant with distance, so **surface magnitude** \( \mu \) is constant with distance.

\[
\boxed{\text{Independent of distance}}
\]

This is the **surface brightness conservation** law in static Euclidean geometry."
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"Alright — let’s go step by step.  

We start from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation** for two bodies (mass of Sun \( M \gg \) mass of planet \( m \)), so we treat the Sun as fixed at the origin (good approximation for reduced mass correction small).  

---

## **Step 1: Equation of motion**

Gravitational force on the planet:

\[
\mathbf{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Newton’s second law:

\[
m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Cancel \( m \):

\[
\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

This is a central force motion, so **angular momentum is conserved**.

---

## **Step 2: Conservation of angular momentum**

Define angular momentum per unit mass:

\[
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}
\]

From \( \ddot{\mathbf{r}} \) parallel to \( \mathbf{r} \), we have \( \dot{\mathbf{h}} = 0 \), so \( \mathbf{h} \) is constant.

Thus motion is in a plane. In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) in that plane:

\[
h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

---

## **Step 3: Deriving the orbit equation**

Radial acceleration in polar coordinates:

\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

Substitute \( \dot{\theta} = h/r^2 \):

\[
\ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

Let \( u = 1/r \), and \( r = 1/u \). Also \( \dot{\theta} = h u^2 \).

Chain rule:  
\[
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right) \cdot h u^2 = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} \cdot h u^2 = -h \frac{du}{d\theta}
\]

\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -h \frac{du}{d\theta} \right) = -h \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} \dot{\theta} = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2}
\]

Plug into radial equation \( \ddot{r} - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2 \):

\[
-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2
\]

Divide by \( -h^2 u^2 \):

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]

---

## **Step 4: Solve the differential equation**

This is a harmonic oscillator equation in \( u \) with constant forcing:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Let \( e = A h^2 / (GM) \) (eccentricity), \( p = h^2/(GM) \) (semilatus rectum). Then:

\[
u = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM}{h^2} \left[ 1 + e \cos(\theta - \theta_0) \right]
\]

Or:

\[
r = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos(\theta - \theta_0)}
\]

This is the equation of a **conic section** with the Sun at one focus (Kepler’s 1st law).

---

## **Step 5: Kepler’s second law (equal areas in equal times)**

Area swept out in time \( dt \):

\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} \, dt = \frac{1}{2} h \, dt
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

So area is swept at a constant rate — Kepler’s second law.

---

## **Step 6: Kepler’s third law for elliptical orbits**

For an ellipse:  
Semimajor axis \( a \), semiminor axis \( b \), \( b^2 = a^2 (1-e^2) \).

From geometry: \( p = a(1-e^2) \), and \( p = h^2/(GM) \), so:

\[
h^2 = GM a (1-e^2)
\]

Area of ellipse \( = \pi a b = \pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2} \).

Period \( T \) = area / (dA/dt):

\[
T = \frac{\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{h/2} = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{h}
\]

Substitute \( h = \sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)} \):

\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{\sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
\]

Thus \( T^2 \propto a^3 \) — Kepler’s third law.

---

**Final summary derived from universal gravitation:**

1. **Kepler’s 1st law**: Orbits are conic sections \( r = \frac{p}{1+e\cos\theta} \) with Sun at a focus.  
2. **Kepler’s 2nd law**: \( dA/dt = \text{constant} \) from angular momentum conservation.  
3. **Kepler’s 3rd law**: \( T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \) for closed elliptical orbits."
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for the two cases.","According to: 

(I) The observed rotation curve is flat near the Sun. $V$ is constant $\rightarrow \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=0$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=0$

According to: 

(II) If the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at the centre, then we consider Keplerian motion. $V=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\to\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}.$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the given relations**

We have:

- Sun at \( R_0 = 8.5 \text{ kpc} \) from Galactic Centre (GC).
- Sun’s orbital angular velocity: \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \).
- Cloud’s orbital angular velocity: \( \Omega = V / R \), where \( R \) is cloud’s distance from GC.
- Galactic rotation clockwise seen from NGP → angular velocity vector points downward (negative \( z \) direction), but magnitude \( \Omega \) is positive.

Given exact formulas:

\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

---

## **Step 2: Oort’s approximation for \( D \ll R_0 \)**

For small \( D \), let \( R \) be cloud’s distance from GC, \( D \) from Sun.

Geometry:  
From cosine rule in triangle Sun–GC–Cloud:

\[
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
\]

For \( D \ll R_0 \), expand \( R \approx R_0 - D\cos l \) (first order in \( D \)).

Angular velocity difference:

\[
\Omega(R) - \Omega_0 \approx \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
\]
\[
R - R_0 \approx -D\cos l
\]
So:
\[
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D\cos l
\]

---

## **Step 3: Oort’s constants \( A \) and \( B \)**

Known definitions:

\[
A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]
\[
B = -\left( \Omega_0 + \frac{R_0}{2} \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right)
\]
Or equivalently:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right)
\]
\[
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right)
\]

From \( V = R\Omega \), we have:
\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = \Omega + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}
\]
At \( R = R_0 \):
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]

---

## **Step 4: Relating \( A \) to \( dV/dR \)**

From \( A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \big|_{R_0} \), we get:
\[
\left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{2A}{R_0}
\]

Substitute into \( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left( -\frac{2A}{R_0} \right) \):

\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 - 2A
\]
But \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \).

So:
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2A
\]
This is a general kinematic relation, independent of the mass distribution.

---

## **Step 5: Case I — Actual observed rotation curve**

For the **actual Galaxy**, rotation curve is roughly **flat** near the Sun: \( V(R) \approx \text{constant} = V_0 \).

Thus:
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0
\]

So:
\[
\frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2A = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \frac{V_0}{2R_0}
\]
Numerically, \( V_0 \approx 220 \text{ km/s}, R_0 = 8.5 \text{ kpc} \), so \( A \approx 220/(2 \times 8.5) \ \text{km/s/kpc} \approx 12.9 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \), but that’s just a check.

For the derivative:
\[
\boxed{\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0}
\]
for a flat rotation curve.

---

## **Step 6: Case II — Hypothetical: all mass at center**

If all mass \( M \) is at Galactic center, then from Newtonian gravity for a test mass in circular orbit:

\[
\frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{GM}{R^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]
So \( V \propto R^{-1/2} \).

Differentiate:
\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sqrt{GM}}{R^{3/2}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V}{R}
\]

At \( R = R_0 \), \( V = V_0 \):

\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}
\]

Numerically: \( V_0/R_0 \approx 220/8.5 \approx 25.9 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \), so \( dV/dR \approx -12.95 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \).

Thus:
\[
\boxed{\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}}
\]

## **Step 7: Summary**

Case I (actual observed, flat rotation curve):
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0
\]

Case II (Keplerian, mass at center):
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}
\]

These are the required expressions."
20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

$\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{t}}&=(\Omega-\Omega_0)R_0\cos l-\Omega D=\frac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](-D\cos l)R_0\cos l-\Omega_0i=\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D\cos^2l-\Omega_0D=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D(1+\cos2l)-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}+\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}D\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the given relations**

We have:

\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

Here:
- \( \Omega = V(R)/R \) (angular velocity at cloud’s galactocentric radius \( R \))
- \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \) (angular velocity at Sun’s radius \( R_0 \))
- \( R \) is galactocentric distance of cloud
- \( D \) is distance from Sun to cloud
- \( l \) is Galactic longitude

---

## **2. Geometry for \( D \ll R_0 \)**

For \( D \ll R_0 \), we can use the approximation:

\[
R \approx R_0 - D\cos l
\]
This comes from the cosine rule \( R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l \) and expanding to first order in \( D/R_0 \):

\[
R \approx R_0 - D\cos l
\]

---

## **3. Expanding \( \Omega - \Omega_0 \) to first order in \( D \)**

Let \( \Omega(R) = V(R)/R \).

We expand \( \Omega(R) \) around \( R_0 \):

\[
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
\]

But \( R - R_0 \approx -D\cos l \).

So:
\[
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (-D\cos l)
\]

---

## **4. Express \( d\Omega/dR \) in terms of \( dV/dR \)**

\[
\Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
\]
\[
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
\]

At \( R = R_0 \), \( V = V_0 \):

\[
\left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
\]

---

## **5. First-order expression for \( V_r \)**

From \( V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \):

\[
V_r \approx \left[ \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right) (-D\cos l) \right] R_0 \sin l
\]

Simplify:

\[
V_r \approx -\left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \cos l \sin l
\]

Use \( \cos l \sin l = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2l \):

\[
V_r \approx -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \sin 2l
\]

---

## **6. Compare with given \( V_r = A D \sin 2l \)**

Given \( V_r = A D \sin 2l \), we identify:

\[
A = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
\]

---

## **7. First-order expression for \( V_t \)**

Given:
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

First term: \( (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx \left[ \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right) (-D\cos l) \right] R_0 \cos l \)

\[
= -\left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \cos^2 l
\]

Second term: \( -\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R-R_0) D \) — but careful: \( -\Omega D \) to first order in \( D \) is \( -\Omega_0 D \) plus a term of order \( D^2 \) if we expand \( \Omega \) in \( D \), but \( \Omega \) inside is at \( R \) not \( R_0 \), so we must expand \( \Omega \) as before:

\[
\Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (-D\cos l)
\]
So:
\[
-\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (-D\cos l) D
\]
The last term is \( \propto D^2 \), so to first order in \( D \), \( -\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D \).

Thus:
\[
V_t \approx -\left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
\]

---

## **8. Rewrite \( \cos^2 l \)**

Use \( \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} \):

\[
V_t \approx -\left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
\]

---

## **9. Compare with given \( V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D \)**

Given \( V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D \), match coefficients of \( \cos 2l \) and constant term.

Coefficient of \( D \cos 2l \):

From above: \( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D \cos 2l \)

But earlier we found \( A = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) \), so indeed the \( \cos 2l \) term is \( A D \cos 2l \). Good.

Constant term (in \( D \)):

From above: \( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D - \Omega_0 D \)

That is \( A D - \Omega_0 D \).

So \( B D = (A - \Omega_0) D \), hence \( B = A - \Omega_0 \).

---

## **10. Express \( B \) in terms of \( V_0, R_0, dV/dR \)**

We have:
\[
A = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
\]
\[
\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
\]
\[
B = A - \Omega_0 = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
\]

Simplify \( B \):

\[
B = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
\]
\[
B = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
\]
\[
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
\]

---

## **11. Final answer**

\[
\boxed{A = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right), \quad B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)}
\]

These are the Oort constants expressed in terms of \( V_0, R_0, \) and \( \frac{dV}{dR} \big|_{R_0} \)."
21,"Consider a binary system of black holes, both of equal mass $M$, separated by a distance $a$, and revolving around their common center of mass (CM) in circular orbits. This binary system moves against, and interacts with, a very large, uniform field of stars (each of mass $m \ll M$) with number density n. Consider a star that approaches the system from infinity with speed v and impact parameter b, in the reference frame of the CM (As shown in the figure)<image>GSTD-Fig-7</image>. Its closest approach distance to the CM is $r_{p} \approx \frac{1}{2}a$. For tasks (a) and (c), you should make use of the fact that $v^{2} \ll \frac{GM}{a}$.

Conclude: 

$b\approx\frac{\sqrt{2GMa}}{v}$ Where we have used $v^{2}\ll\frac{GM}{a}$ in the last step.",Yes,
22,"The accretion of matter onto compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy in astrophysical systems.

This process occurs very slowly, transforming kinetic energy into internal energy of the gas disc through viscous dissipation.

According to: 

$E(R_{max}) - E(r) = \frac{1}{2} GM \Delta m \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}} \right) = \frac{GM \Delta m}{2r} \left( 1 - \frac{r}{R_{max}} \right) \approx \frac{GM \Delta m}{2r}$

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have a thin accretion disk around a compact object of mass \( M \).  
Gas starts at radius \( R_{\text{max}} \) and spirals inward very slowly due to viscosity, staying nearly in a circular Keplerian orbit at each radius until it reaches some smaller radius \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \).

We want the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by a gas element of mass \( \Delta m \) as it goes from \( R_{\text{max}} \) to \( r \).

We ignore self-gravity of the disk.

---

## **2. Mechanical energy of a Keplerian circular orbit**

For a test mass \( \Delta m \) in a circular orbit of radius \( R \) around mass \( M \):

- **Orbital speed** from Newton’s 2nd law + gravity:

\[
\frac{GM(\Delta m)}{R^2} = (\Delta m) \frac{v^2}{R}
\]
\[
v^2 = \frac{GM}{R}
\]

- **Kinetic energy per unit mass**:

\[
\frac{K}{\Delta m} = \frac12 v^2 = \frac12 \frac{GM}{R}
\]

- **Potential energy per unit mass** (gravitational potential \( \Phi = -\frac{GM}{R} \) for Newtonian point mass; we’re ignoring the object’s finite radius \( R_* \) for now since \( r \gg R_* \)):

\[
\frac{U}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{R}
\]

- **Total mechanical energy per unit mass**:

\[
\varepsilon(R) = \frac{E}{\Delta m} = \frac12 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2R}
\]

So:

\[
\varepsilon(R) = -\frac{GM}{2R}
\]

---

## **3. Energy released**

Initially at \( R_{\text{max}} \), energy per unit mass:

\[
\varepsilon_i = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
\]

Finally at \( r \), energy per unit mass:

\[
\varepsilon_f = -\frac{GM}{2r}
\]

The **mechanical energy lost** (and thus converted to heat via viscosity) per unit mass is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_f
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \left(-\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}\right) - \left(-\frac{GM}{2r}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
\]

---

## **4. Using \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \)**

Given \( R_{\text{min}} / R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 \) and \( r \) is small (but \( r \ge R_{\text{min}} \)), and \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \), we have \( 1/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1/r \).

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \approx \frac{1}{r}
\]

So:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
\]

---

## **5. Final answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}
\]

This is the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by the gas spiraling from a large radius \( R_{\text{max}} \) down to a much smaller radius \( r \), in the approximation \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \)."
23,"Magnetic fields in the Sun are constantly shaping the structure of various different features in the Solar atmosphere. Inside any feature, the magnetic field (B) adds to the total pressure exerted by the gas. This so-called magnetic pressure is a function of the height z and can be expressed as: ${P_{mag}}(z) = \frac{{B^2(z)}}{{2\mu_0}}$

On the other hand, the gas can be considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and hence the gas pressure decays exponentially from an initial pressure value $P_0$ with increasing z. It can be expressed as, ${P_{gas}}(z) = P_0e^{-z/H}$

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- **Initial distance** between Earth and mirror: \( D \) (at \( t = 0 \), when the light is emitted).
- **Separation law** due to expansion:  
\[
S(t) = s \, e^{H_0 t}
\]
Here \( s \) is the initial separation at \( t = 0 \) when the light is emitted.  
So \( s = D \).

Thus:
\[
S(t) = D \, e^{H_0 t}
\]
where \( S(t) \) is the distance from Earth to mirror at cosmic time \( t \) (Earth’s time).

---

## **2. Light travel to the mirror**

Let \( t = 0 \) be emission time from Earth.

The light travels toward the mirror, but the mirror is receding due to expansion.

Let \( t_1 \) be the time when light reaches the mirror.

During the light’s travel from \( 0 \) to \( t_1 \), the mirror’s position changes.

We set up the equation for light catching the mirror:

Light’s position from Earth at time \( t \): \( x_{\text{light}}(t) = c t \).

Mirror’s position from Earth at time \( t \): \( S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \).

They meet when:
\[
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}.
\]

---

## **3. Light travel back to Earth**

At \( t_1 \), the light reflects and heads back toward Earth.

Now Earth is receding from the mirror’s location at \( t_1 \) due to expansion.

Let \( t_2 \) be the return time to Earth.

At \( t_1 \), mirror’s distance from Earth is \( D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

During \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \), Earth’s position is fixed at origin in these coordinates, but the distance light must cover is not simply \( D e^{H_0 t_1} \) because the distance itself expands during the return trip.

Actually, careful: The light’s travel back:  
At time \( t \) (with \( t \ge t_1 \)), the distance from mirror to Earth is \( S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \).

But the light is at some position \( y(t) \) measured from Earth toward mirror? Wait, better to think in terms of **comoving coordinates** but maybe not necessary.

Let’s instead think directly:

Let \( L(t) \) = distance from Earth to mirror at time \( t \):
\[
L(t) = D e^{H_0 t}.
\]

At \( t = t_1 \), \( L(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

Light starts at mirror at \( t_1 \) and moves toward Earth at speed \( c \) relative to local space (but space is expanding).

The equation for light’s motion toward Earth:  
Let \( x(t) \) = distance from Earth to light at time \( t \) (during return trip). Initially \( x(t_1) = L(t_1) \).

The light moves toward Earth, so \( dx/dt \) is negative.  
Relative to the expanding space: the light’s speed toward Earth is \( c \), but the distance \( L(t) \) is increasing. Actually, the proper distance between Earth and mirror at time \( t \) is \( L(t) \), but the light is somewhere in between.

Better: Let \( r(t) \) = distance from Earth to light at time \( t \) during return.  
The rate of change \( dr/dt \) has two parts:  
1. Due to expansion: \( H_0 r(t) \) (if light were at rest in comoving coordinates, its proper distance would increase at \( H_0 r \)), but  
2. Light moves through space at speed \( c \) toward Earth, so relative to the Hubble flow, its velocity is \( -c \) in proper distance terms.

Thus:
\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = H_0 r(t) - c.
\]
During return, \( r(t) \) decreases from \( r(t_1) = L(t_1) \) to \( r(t_2) = 0 \) at \( t = t_2 \).

---

## **4. Solve for \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \)**

**Outbound trip equation:**
\[
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}.
\]
We expect \( H_0 t_1 \ll 1 \) because \( D \) is not huge cosmologically? Possibly not, but they say \( e^x \approx 1+x \) for \( x \ll 1 \) may be used. So we’ll use that at the end.

**Return trip equation:**
\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = H_0 r - c, \quad r(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1}.
\]
This is a linear ODE. Solve:

Homogeneous: \( r_h(t) = A e^{H_0 t} \).

Particular solution: constant \( r_p = c / H_0 \).

General: \( r(t) = A e^{H_0 t} + \frac{c}{H_0} \).

Initial condition at \( t = t_1 \):
\[
D e^{H_0 t_1} = A e^{H_0 t_1} + \frac{c}{H_0}.
\]
So:
\[
A = D - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1}.
\]

Thus:
\[
r(t) = \left[ D - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} \right] e^{H_0 t} + \frac{c}{H_0}.
\]

At return \( t = t_2 \), \( r(t_2) = 0 \):
\[
0 = \left[ D - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} \right] e^{H_0 t_2} + \frac{c}{H_0}.
\]
So:
\[
\left[ D - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} \right] e^{H_0 t_2} = -\frac{c}{H_0}.
\]

---

## **5. Use outbound equation to simplify**

From outbound: \( D e^{H_0 t_1} = c t_1 \), so \( D = c t_1 e^{-H_0 t_1} \).

Plug \( D \) into the bracket:
\[
D - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} = c t_1 e^{-H_0 t_1} - \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} = c e^{-H_0 t_1} \left( t_1 - \frac{1}{H_0} \right).
\]

Thus return equation becomes:
\[
c e^{-H_0 t_1} \left( t_1 - \frac{1}{H_0} \right) e^{H_0 t_2} = -\frac{c}{H_0}.
\]
Cancel \( c \):
\[
e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} \left( t_1 - \frac{1}{H_0} \right) = -\frac{1}{H_0}.
\]

So:
\[
e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = \frac{ -1/H_0 }{ t_1 - 1/H_0 } = \frac{1}{1 - H_0 t_1}.
\]
Thus:
\[
t_2 - t_1 = \frac{1}{H_0} \ln\left( \frac{1}{1 - H_0 t_1} \right).
\]

---

## **6. Total round-trip time \( T \)**

Given \( T \) = time between emission and detection = \( t_2 \).

So \( T = t_2 \), and \( t_1 \) is the one-way travel time outbound.

We have \( t_1 \) from outbound equation \( c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

For small \( H_0 t_1 \), use \( e^{H_0 t_1} \approx 1 + H_0 t_1 \):
\[
c t_1 \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1).
\]
\[
c t_1 - D H_0 t_1 \approx D.
\]
\[
t_1 (c - D H_0) \approx D.
\]
\[
t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - D H_0}.
\]

Also \( t_2 - t_1 \approx \frac{1}{H_0} \left[ H_0 t_1 + \frac{(H_0 t_1)^2}{2} + \dots \right] \) from series expansion of log, but let’s keep first order:

For small \( H_0 t_1 \), \( \ln(1/(1 - H_0 t_1)) = -\ln(1 - H_0 t_1) \approx H_0 t_1 + \frac{(H_0 t_1)^2}{2} + \dots \).

So:
\[
t_2 - t_1 \approx t_1 + \frac{H_0 t_1^2}{2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
T = t_2 \approx t_1 + \left( t_1 + \frac{H_0 t_1^2}{2} \right)?? 
\]
Wait, careful: \( T = t_2 = t_1 + (t_2 - t_1) \approx t_1 + t_1 + \frac{H_0 t_1^2}{2} = 2 t_1 + \frac{H_0 t_1^2}{2}.
\]

But \( t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - D H_0} \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + \frac{D H_0}{c}) \) for small \( D H_0 / c \).

Let’s instead solve directly for \( H_0 \) in terms of \( T, D, c \).

---

## **7. Direct relation from outbound and return**

From outbound: \( c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

From return time difference: \( e^{H_0 (T - t_1)} = \frac{1}{1 - H_0 t_1} \).

We can eliminate \( t_1 \). Let \( \tau = t_1 \).

From first eq: \( D = c \tau e^{-H_0 \tau} \).

From second eq: \( e^{H_0 (T - \tau)} = \frac{1}{1 - H_0 \tau} \).

So \( T - \tau = -\frac{1}{H_0} \ln(1 - H_0 \tau) \).

For small \( H_0 \tau \), expand:  
\( -\ln(1 - H_0 \tau) \approx H_0 \tau + \frac{(H_0 \tau)^2}{2} + \dots \)

So:
\[
T - \tau \approx \tau + \frac{H_0 \tau^2}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
T \approx 2\tau + \frac{H_0 \tau^2}{2}.
\]

Also from outbound: \( c \tau \approx D (1 + H_0 \tau) \) ⇒ \( \tau \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + H_0 \tau) \) ⇒ \( \tau \approx \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D H_0}{c} \tau \) ⇒ \( \tau (1 - \frac{D H_0}{c}) \approx \frac{D}{c} \) ⇒ \( \tau \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + \frac{D H_0}{c}) \).

Now plug \( \tau \approx \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D^2 H_0}{c^2} \) into \( T \approx 2\tau + \frac{H_0 \tau^2}{2} \):

First term: \( 2\tau \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2D^2 H_0}{c^2} \).

Second term: \( \frac{H_0 \tau^2}{2} \approx \frac{H_0}{2} \left( \frac{D^2}{c^2} + \text{small} \right) \approx \frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} \).

So:
\[
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2D^2 H_0}{c^2} + \frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{5 D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
T - \frac{2D}{c} \approx \frac{5 D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}.
\]

So:
\[
H_0 \approx \frac{2 c^2}{5 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right).
\]

---

## **8. Final expression**

\[
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2c^2}{5D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}
\]

This is the approximate expression for \( H_0 \) in terms of \( D, c, T \), valid for \( H_0 t_1 \ll 1 \), i.e., \( D H_0 / c \ll 1 \)."
26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the problem**

We have:

- Two identical neutron stars, each mass \( M \), orbiting in a circle of radius \( R \) around their center of mass.
- The orbit is Newtonian, but gravitational waves carry away energy at a luminosity \( L_{\text{GW}} \).
- \( L_{\text{GW}} \) depends on \( G, c, M, R \) and a dimensionless constant \( \frac{2}{5} \).
- \( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power in the formula.

We must find \( L_{\text{GW}} \) using dimensional analysis plus the given constant.

---

## **Step 2: Dimensional analysis**

Luminosity (power) has dimensions:

\[
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \text{energy/time} = M L^2 T^{-3}.
\]

Here \( M \) means mass dimension, \( L \) length, \( T \) time.

Constants:

- \( G \) (gravitational constant): dimensions \( M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} \).
- \( c \) (speed of light): dimensions \( L T^{-1} \).
- \( M \) (mass of each neutron star): dimension \( M \).
- \( R \) (orbital radius from center of mass to each star): dimension \( L \).

We are told \( c \) and \( R \) appear to the same power. Let’s call that power \( a \).

So try:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = k \, G^\alpha \, c^\beta \, M^\gamma \, R^\delta,
\]
with \( k = \frac{2}{5} \) dimensionless, and \( \beta = \delta \) (since \( c \) and \( R \) have same power).

---

## **Step 3: Set up dimensional equation**

Write dimensions:

\[
[G^\alpha] = M^{-\alpha} L^{3\alpha} T^{-2\alpha}
\]
\[
[c^\beta] = L^{\beta} T^{-\beta}
\]
\[
[M^\gamma] = M^{\gamma}
\]
\[
[R^\delta] = L^{\delta}
\]

Multiply them: total dimensions:

Mass: \( -\alpha + \gamma = 1 \) (since LHS has \( M^1 \) in \( M L^2 T^{-3} \))  
Length: \( 3\alpha + \beta + \delta = 2 \)  
Time: \( -2\alpha - \beta = -3 \)

Also given \( \beta = \delta \).

---

## **Step 4: Solve system of equations**

From mass: \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha \).

From time: \( -2\alpha - \beta = -3 \) → \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \).  … (1)

From length: \( 3\alpha + \beta + \delta = 2 \) → but \( \delta = \beta \), so \( 3\alpha + 2\beta = 2 \). … (2)

Solve (1) and (2):

From (1): \( \beta = 3 - 2\alpha \).

Sub into (2): \( 3\alpha + 2(3 - 2\alpha) = 2 \)  
\( 3\alpha + 6 - 4\alpha = 2 \)  
\( -\alpha + 6 = 2 \)  
\( -\alpha = -4 \) → \( \alpha = 4 \).

Then \( \beta = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 \).

So \( \beta = -5 \), \( \delta = -5 \).

Then \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha = 1 + 4 = 5 \).

---

## **Step 5: Write the expression**

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = k \, G^4 \, c^{-5} \, M^5 \, R^{-5}.
\]

Factor \( c^{-5} R^{-5} = (cR)^{-5} \) maybe, but usually written as:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = k \, \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

Given \( k = \frac{2}{5} \), so:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

---

## **Step 6: Check known formula**

For two equal masses \( M \) in circular orbit, separation \( 2R \) (since each at distance \( R \) from CM), orbital radius \( a = 2R \).

The known quadrupole formula for gravitational wave luminosity in Newtonian circular binary:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 \mu^2 M^3}{c^5 a^5},
\]
where \( M = m_1 + m_2 = 2M \) (total mass), \( \mu = M/2 \) (reduced mass), \( a = 2R \).

Let’s check: \( M_{\text{total}} = 2M \), \( \mu = M/2 \), \( a = 2R \).

\[
\mu^2 M^3 = \left( \frac{M}{2} \right)^2 (2M)^3 = \frac{M^2}{4} \cdot 8 M^3 = 2 M^5.
\]

So:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 \cdot 2 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{32}{5} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 \cdot 32 R^5}.
\]

Simplify: \( 32 \cdot 2 = 64 \), divide by \( 32 \) → \( 2 \):

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

Matches exactly our dimensional analysis result.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
\]"
27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the setup**

We have two identical neutron stars, each of mass \( M \), in a circular orbit of radius \( R \) around their center of mass.  
Here \( R \) is the **orbital radius** (distance from each star to the center of mass), so the separation between the two stars is \( 2R \).

The total mechanical energy in Newtonian gravity for a binary system with equal masses \( M \) in circular orbits:

---

## **Step 2: Newtonian orbital energy**

For two masses \( M \) separated by distance \( a \), the Newtonian orbital energy is:

\[
E_{\text{orbit}} = -\frac{G M^2}{2a}
\]
where \( a \) is the separation between the two stars.

Here \( a = 2R \), so:

\[
E_{\text{orbit}} = -\frac{G M^2}{2 \cdot (2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}.
\]

---

## **Step 3: Relating energy loss to gravitational wave luminosity**

The gravitational wave luminosity \( L_{GW} \) is given as:

\[
L_{GW} = \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}.
\]

This must equal the rate at which the orbital energy decreases (since energy is carried away by GWs):

\[
L_{GW} = -\frac{dE_{\text{orbit}}}{dt}.
\]

---

## **Step 4: Differentiating \( E_{\text{orbit}} \) with respect to time**

We have \( E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R} \).

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \right)
= \frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt}.
\]

Wait — careful:  
\( E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R} \)  
\( \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} \).

Yes, because \( \frac{d}{dt} (R^{-1}) = -R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} \), and the minus sign from \( E \)’s expression cancels with that? Let’s check explicitly:

\[
E = -\frac{k}{R}, \quad k = \frac{G M^2}{4}.
\]
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{k}{-R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}? \quad \text{No, that’s wrong.}
\]

Actually:  
\( E = -k R^{-1} \)  
\( \frac{dE}{dt} = -k \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = +k R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} \).

So indeed:
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}.
\]

---

## **Step 5: Energy balance equation**

Gravitational waves carry away energy at rate \( L_{GW} \), so:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{GW}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}.
\]

---

## **Step 6: Solve for \( \frac{dR}{dt} \)**

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} \):

\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}.
\]

Simplify:

- \( G^4 / G = G^3 \)
- \( M^5 / M^2 = M^3 \)
- \( R^2 / R^5 = R^{-3} \)

So:

\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}.
\]

---

## **Step 7: Final expression**

\[
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}
\]

This is the rate at which the orbital radius \( R \) (distance from each star to the center of mass) shrinks due to gravitational wave emission in the Newtonian circular orbit approximation."
