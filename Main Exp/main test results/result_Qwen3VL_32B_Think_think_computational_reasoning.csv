1,"You are an astronaut exploring a newly discovered planet Y. Planet Y has a mass that is 4.32 times the mass of Earth and a radius that is 0.70 times the radius of Earth.

If your mass is 78.1 kg, determine:
1. The formula for the gravitational force acting on you on Earth.
2. The gravitational force acting on you on planet Y.
3. How the gravitational force on planet Y compares to that on Earth.","### Step 1: Gravitational force on Earth
The gravitational force experienced by an object of mass $m$ on Earth is given by

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Earth}} m}{R_{\text{Earth}}^2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{(6.67430 \times 10^{-11})(5.972 \times 10^{24})(78.1)}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2}
\]

This gives:
\[
F_{\text{Earth}} \approx 767.24\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 2: Gravitational force on planet Y
The same formula applies, but with the planet's mass and radius:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Y}} m}{R_{\text{Y}}^2}
\]

where:
- $M_{\text{Y}} = 4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}$
- $R_{\text{Y}} = 0.70 R_{\text{Earth}}$

Substituting:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G (4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}) m}{(0.70 R_{\text{Earth}})^2}
\]

Numerically, this yields:
\[
F_{\text{Y}} \approx 6792.57\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Comparison of forces
The ratio of the gravitational force on planet Y to that on Earth is:

\[
\frac{F_{\text{Y}}}{F_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{4.32}{(0.70)^2}

What is the first velocity increment (ΔV₁) required to place the probe onto the Hohmann transfer orbit?","### Step 1: Determine the orbital radii
The radius of the initial circular orbit is:

The radius of the final circular orbit is:

r₂ = R + h₂ = 4495 km + 27795 km = 32290 km

### Step 4: Compute the velocity at periapsis of the transfer orbit
The velocity at periapsis of the transfer ellipse is:

- Semimajor axis of the target planet's orbit: 5.02 AU

    v² = GM☉ ( 2/r − 1/a )

For a Hohmann transfer from Earth to the target planet, the perihelion distance is Earth's orbital radius and the aphelion distance is the target planet’s orbital radius. The semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse is therefore:

    a = (r_E + r_P)/2 = (1.00 AU + 5.02 AU)/2
      = 3.011 AU

At the distance of the target planet, r = r_P, the spacecraft’s heliocentric speed is:

    v_sc = [ GM☉ ( 2/r_P − 1/a ) ]^{1/2}

Substituting the given values:

    v_sc = [ 1.327e+11 ( 2/5.02 − 1/3.011 ) ]^0.5

Substituting the numerical value:

    v_P = ( 1.327e+11 / 5.02 )^0.5

96,"A satellite is initially in a circular parking orbit at an altitude of 192 km above Earth with an orbital inclination of 35.6°. The satellite must be transferred to a zero-inclination geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) using a Hohmann transfer. The inclination change is performed simultaneously with circularization at apogee.

Determine the total velocity change (ΔVₜ) required for this maneuver. Express your answer in meters per second (m/s).","### Step 1: Define orbital radii
- Earth radius: $R_E = 6,378$ km
- Parking orbit radius:
  \[
  r_1 = R_E + h = 6,378 + 192 = 6570\;\text{km}
  \]
- GEO radius:
  \[
  r_2 = 42,164\;\text{km}
  \]

### Step 2: Compute circular velocities
The circular orbital velocity is given by:
\[
v = \sqrt{\mu / r}
\]
- Parking orbit velocity:
  \[
  v_{c1} = 7,789\;\text{m/s}
  \]
- GEO circular velocity:
  \[
  v_{c2} = 3,075\;\text{m/s}

### Step 3: Hohmann transfer velocities
The semi-major axis of the transfer orbit is:
\[
a = \frac{r_1 + r_2}2 = 24,367\;\text{km}
\]
- Velocity at perigee of transfer orbit:
  \[
  v_p = 10,246\;\text{m/s}
  \]
- Velocity at apogee of transfer orbit:
  \[
  v_a = 1,597\;\text{m/s}
  \]

### Step 4: Delta-V at perigee
\[
\Delta V_1 = v_p - v_{c1} = 2,457\;\text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Combined circularization and plane change at apogee
The inclination change is combined with circularization using:
\[
\Delta V_2 = \sqrt{v_a^2 + v_{c2}^2 - 2 v_a v_{c2} \cos(\Delta i)}
\]
Substituting $\Delta i = 35.6^\circ$:
\[
\Delta V_2 = 2,005\;\text{m/s}

a) What is the satellite’s altitude at apogee?

Provide your answer in kilometers.","To determine the satellite’s altitude at apogee, we use the geometry of an elliptical orbit.

Step 1: Compute the radius at perigee.
The radius at perigee Rₚ is the sum of Earth’s radius and the altitude at perigee:

    Rₚ = R_E + hₚ = 6378 + 604

Step 2: Determine the semi-major axis of the orbit.
For an elliptical orbit, the perigee radius is related to the semi-major axis a by:

    Rₚ = a(1 − e)

Solving for a:

    a = Rₚ / (1 − e)

Substituting the known values:

    a = 6982 / (1 − 0.08)

Substituting the values:

    Rₐ = 7600(1 + 0.08)
      = 8218 km

Step 4: Convert the apogee radius to altitude.
The altitude at apogee hₐ is the apogee radius minus Earth’s radius:

    hₐ = Rₐ − R_E = 8218 − 6378

The position vector is aligned entirely along the \( +\hat{I} \) direction.

\[
\vec{R} = R_x \hat{I}, \quad R_y = 0, \quad R_z = 0
\]

This indicates that the satellite lies on the Earth's equatorial plane (since the \( z \)-component is zero) and is located on the positive x-axis.

The velocity vector has no \( x \)-component, but has equal-magnitude \( y \) and \( z \) components with opposite signs:

\[
V_y = 3.531 \text{ km/s}, \quad V_z = -3.531 \text{ km/s}

A negative \( z \)-component indicates motion toward the southern hemisphere, while the positive \( y \)-component indicates eastward motion.

**1. Determine the mean motion**

The mean motion, $n$, is the angular rate at which the satellite moves along its orbit:

\[
n = \frac{360^\circ}{T} = \frac{360^\circ}{3.24\,\text{hours}} = 111.06^\circ/\text{hour}

The unwrapped final argument of latitude is:

\[

**4. Normalize the result to the range 0°–360°**

Assuming the maneuver is performed as a single combined burn, what is the total ΔV required? Express your answer in kilometers per second (km/s).","### Step 1: Identify the appropriate formula

For a combined velocity change and plane change, the required ΔV is given by:

- Initial orbit radius: $r_1 = 7579\,\text{km}$
- Final orbit radius: $r_2 = 41589\,\text{km}$

- Final inclination: $i_2 = 5.0^\circ$
- Earth's gravitational parameter: $\mu = 398600\,\text{km}^3/\text{s}^2$

### Step 2: Circular orbit velocities

The velocity in a circular orbit is:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}}$$

- Initial circular velocity:
  $$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{398600}{7579}} = 7.252\,\text{km/s}$$

Velocities on the transfer orbit are given by the vis-viva equation:

$$\Delta V_1 = |v_p - v_1|$$

$$\Delta V_1 = |9.432 - 7.252| = 2.180\,\text{km/s}$$

294,"An object is initially in a circular orbit with a radius of 9615 km. It must be transferred to a higher circular orbit with a radius of 234800 km.

For this maneuver, engineers have determined that a bi-elliptical transfer is the most fuel-efficient option, with the intermediate apogee of the transfer orbits located at a radius of 809115 km from the center of the Earth.

Assuming the Earth's gravitational parameter is μ = 398600.5 km³/s², determine the total time of flight for the bi-elliptical transfer. Express your answer in days.","### Step 1: Identify the given values
- Initial orbit radius: r₁ = 9615 km
- Final orbit radius: r₂ = 234800 km
- Transfer apogee radius: r_b = 809115 km
- Gravitational parameter: μ = 398600.5 km³/s²

The total time of flight for a bi-elliptical transfer is the sum of half the orbital periods of the two transfer ellipses:
\[
TOF = \pi \left( \sqrt{\frac{a_{t1}^3}{\mu}} + \sqrt{\frac{a_{t2}^3}{\mu}} \right)

The visible solar flux is $5.23\times10^{2}$ W/m$^2$ with apparent magnitude -26.8. Assume $\lambda=505$ nm.","Step1: For a CCD-like detector dominated by photon shot noise, the signal-to-noise ratio is

$$
\mathrm{SNR} = \sqrt{n} = \sqrt{IQt},

where $I$ is the photon rate entering the pupil, $Q$ is the quantum efficiency,

Requiring $\mathrm{SNR}=1$ gives

302,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. The system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits.

Astronomers measure $R = 0.577\,\text{AU}$ and the orbital period $P = 502.2\,\text{days}$. Calculate $M$, the mass of each neutron star, in solar masses.","Solution Steps:
Step 1: Relate the measured orbit to the relative two-body orbit.
For two identical masses $M$ orbiting the center of mass with radius $R$, the separation between the stars is
$$a = 2R,$$
and the total mass entering Kepler's third law is
$$M_1 + M_2 = 2M.$$

Step 2: Apply Kepler's Third Law to the relative orbit.
Kepler's third law for a two-body system is
$$G(M_1+M_2)P^2 = 4\pi^2 a^3.$$
Substitute $M_1+M_2=2M$ and $a=2R$:
$$G(2M)P^2 = 4\pi^2(2R)^3 = 32\pi^2 R^3.$$
Solve for $M$:
$$M = \frac{16\pi^2 R^3}{G P^2}.$$

Step 3: Convert units and compute.
Use:
$$1\,\text{AU} = 1.496\times 10^{11}\,\text{m},\quad 1\,\text{day}=86400\,\text{s},\quad G=6.674\times 10^{-11}\,\text{m}^3/(\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2),$$
$$1\,M_\odot = 1.989\times 10^{30}\,\text{kg}.$$

Convert $R$ and $P$:
$$R = 0.577\,\text{AU} = 8.638717\times 10^{10}\,\text{m},$$
$$P = 502.2\,\text{days} = 4.338688\times 10^{7}\,\text{s}.$$ 

Substitute into the formula:
$$M = \frac{16\pi^2 R^3}{G P^2}$$
$$M = \frac{16\pi^2(8.638717\times 10^{10}\,\text{m})^3}{(6.674\times 10^{-11}\,\text{m}^3/(\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2))(4.338688\times 10^{7}\,\text{s})^2} = 8.103345\times 10^{29}\,\text{kg}.$$

Estimate the distance to the cluster as well as the mean angular separation between its stars. Ignore interstellar extinction. Also, compute the objective lens diameter of a telescope required to distinguish two stars of the cluster in the optical. State any assumptions you made.","Step 1: Estimate the total luminosity of the cluster.
Assume all stars are Sun-like, so each has luminosity L_⊙. Then the total luminosity is
L = N L_⊙  ⇒  L/L_⊙ = N.
Convert luminosity to absolute bolometric magnitude using Pogson’s law:
M_bol = M_{bol,⊙} − 2.5 log10(L/L_⊙)
M_bol = 4.80 − 2.5 log10(344538) = -9.04

Step 2: Use the distance modulus (no extinction) to solve for distance.
m_bol − M_bol = 5 log10(d/pc) − 5
⇒ d = 10^{(m_bol − M_bol + 5)/5} pc
d = 10^((4.91 − (-9.04) + 5)/5) = 6.17e+03 pc

Step 3: Estimate the mean angular separation between stars.
Assume the stars are uniformly distributed across the cluster’s apparent solid angle Ω.
Then the mean solid angle per star is
Ω_star = Ω / N.
Ω_star = (0.000194) / (344538) = 5.645e-10 sr
A characteristic angular spacing θ can be estimated by treating Ω_star ~ θ^2:
θ ≈ sqrt(Ω_star)
θ ≈ sqrt(5.645e-10) = 2.376e-05 rad ≈ 4.90 arcsec

Step 4: Telescope diameter needed to resolve two stars (diffraction limit).
Using the Rayleigh criterion for a circular aperture:
θ = 1.22 λ / D  ⇒  D = 1.22 λ / θ

    Δv = k √(GM / R).

Compute the dimensionless coefficient k.","Step 1: Use the vis-viva equation for orbital speed:

    v = √[ GM ( 2/r − 1/a ) ].

The initial orbit is circular with radius r = R, so its speed is

    v₁ = √(GM / R).

The transfer orbit is an ellipse with periapsis R and apoapsis αR, so its semi-major axis is

    a = (R + αR)/2 = (α + 1)R / 2.

Evaluating the speed on the transfer orbit at r = R gives

    v_p = √(GM / R) √(2α / (α + 1)).

Thus, the first burn is

    Δv₁ = √(GM / R) [ √(2α / (α + 1)) − 1 ].

Step 2: At the outer orbit (r = αR), the circular orbital speed is

    v₂ = √(GM / (αR)) = √(GM / R) · 1/√α.

The speed on the transfer orbit at r = αR is

    v_a = √(GM / R) · (1/√α) √(2 / (α + 1)).

The second burn is therefore

    Δv₂ = √(GM / R) · (1/√α) [ 1 − √(2 / (α + 1)) ].

Step 3: Add the two burns to obtain the total delta-v:

    Δv = √(GM / R) { √(2α / (α + 1)) − 1
          + (1/√α)[ 1 − √(2 / (α + 1)) ] }.

The satellite approaches the surface of the planet to a minimum height of 1609 km and recedes to a maximum height of 5635 km. The radius of the planet is 4180 km. If the ratio of the mass of the star to the mass of the planet is 1.0e+05, what is the semi-major axis of the planet's revolution around the star? Assume that the mass of the satellite is much smaller than the mass of the planet.","Step 1: Determine the semi-major axis of the satellite's orbit.
The pericenter distance is r_p = R + h_min = 4180 + 1609 = 5789 km.
The apocenter distance is r_a = R + h_max = 4180 + 5635 = 9815 km.
Thus, the semi-major axis is
a_sat = (r_p + r_a)/2 = (5789 + 9815)/2 = 7802 km.

Step 2: Apply Kepler’s third law to both orbits.
For the satellite around the planet:
T_sat = 2π√(a_sat³ / Gm).
For the planet around the star:
T_p = 2π√(a_p³ / GM).

Step 3: Divide the two equations and simplify, using m_sat ≪ m ≪ M.
(T_p / T_sat)² = (a_p³ / a_sat³) · (m / M).
Since M/m = 1.0e+05, we obtain
a_p³ = a_sat³ · (M/m) · (T_p / T_sat)².

With p in arcseconds, d(pc) = 1/p.
p = 93 mas = 0.093 arcsec
d = 1/0.093 = 10.8 pc
Convert to meters: d = (10.8)(3.086×10^16 m) = 3.318e+17 m

Step 2: Convert the CCD spot size into an angular radius (small-angle approximation).
A linear radius x on the focal plane corresponds to angle θ ≈ x/f.
f = 688 mm = 6.881e-01 m
D = 0.949 µm = 9.487e-07 m, so x = D/2 = 4.743e-07 m
θ = x/f = (4.743e-07)/(6.881e-01) = 6.893e-07 rad
Then the stellar radius is R = θ d:

Step 3: Compute the Sun’s apparent magnitude from the distance modulus at 1 AU.
m_⊙ − M_⊙ = 5 log10(a_pc) − 5, where a_pc is 1 AU in parsecs.
a_pc = AU/pc = (1.496e+11)/(3.086e+16) = 4.848e-06 pc

Assuming uniform angular motion, how long will it take until the two planets again share the same ecliptic longitude?","Step 1: Geometry of the orbit
For a planet with orbital inclination i and angular velocity ω, the relation between its ecliptic longitude λ and time t is obtained from spherical geometry:

Step 2: Condition for equal ecliptic longitude
The planets share the same ecliptic longitude again when:

    cos i₁ · tan(ω₁ t) = cos i₂ · tan(ω₂ t)

Step 3: Use the ratio of angular velocities
Since ω = 2π / T, the angular velocities satisfy:

Step1: A point at latitude $l$ on the surface of a body of radius $R$ is located a distance $R\cos l$ away from the axis of rotation. Thus, the total distance $d$ a point on the surface needs to travel for one full rotation is

These particles are in an orbit of 1.81AU around the Sun. Assuming the radii of these particles are around 0cm and their albedo is 0.38, estimate the density of these particles. Express your answer in particles per square arcsecond.","'''
Step1: We can find the total luminosity from one square arcsecond of this source by using

$$
M-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
\quad\text{and}\quad
m-M=5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right).
$$

Combine these to eliminate $M$:

$$
2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
= M_\odot + 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right) - m
\implies
L=L_\odot\left(\frac{r}{10\:\mathrm{pc}}\right)^2\cdot 10^{(M_\odot-m)/2.5}.
$$

At the antisolar point (directly opposite the Sun), the dust is approximately $r=|R-1|$ AU from Earth, so

$$
r = |1.81-1|\ \text{AU} = 0.81\ \text{AU}
= \frac{0.81}{206265}\ \text{pc}.
$$

Get:

$$
L \approx 2.04\times 10^{11}\ \text{W}.
$$

Step2: Now, let's calculate how much luminosity one particle reflects. To do this, we calculate the solar flux at the dust orbit
and multiply by the particle's cross-sectional area and its albedo.

The solar flux at heliocentric distance $R$ is

$$
F = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}.
$$

A particle of radius $a$ has cross-section $A=\pi a^2$, so the reflected power (in this simplified model) is

$$
L_p = F\,A\,\alpha = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}\cdot (\pi a^2)\cdot \alpha.
$$

With $R=1.81\,\text{AU}$, $a=0\,\text{cm}$, and $\alpha=0.38$:

Get:

$$
L_p \approx 4.98\times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}.
$$

Step3: Finally, divide the total luminosity per arcsec$^2$ by the reflected luminosity per particle:

$$
N = \frac{L}{L_p}
\approx \frac{2.04\times 10^{11}}{4.98\times 10^{-4}}
= 4.1\times 10^{14}\ \text{particles/arcsec}^2.

How long does the satellite take to hit the surface of the planet?","Step 1: Conceptual approach
The satellite initially moves in a circular orbit. When its velocity is reduced to zero, it begins to fall radially toward the planet. Because the initial orbital radius is much larger than the planet’s physical radius, the time to reach the surface is approximately the same as the time to reach the planet’s center.

This motion can be modeled as a degenerate elliptical orbit with:
  • Semi-major axis a = r / 2
  • The planet located at one focus

The satellite reaches the planet after half of the orbital period.

Step 2: Apply Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s Third Law for an orbit is:
    T² / a³ = 4π² / (GM)

Since the fall time t corresponds to half the orbital period:
    T = 2t

Substitute a = r / 2 and T = 2t:

In the standard geometric construction of an ellipse, the semi-minor axis intersects the orbit at points that are a distance $a$ from the focus. This divides the orbit into regions of smaller and larger radial distance.

Step 3:
By Kepler’s second law, the fraction of time spent in a given part of the orbit is equal to the fraction of the total area swept out. Using the standard area decomposition (half the ellipse plus a triangular region), the proportion of the orbital period corresponding to this region is
$$\frac{e + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi}.$$

If the very first stars formed approximately 4.86e+08 years after the Big Bang, what is the most massive such star that could still exist today?","Step 1: Determine the time available for stellar evolution
The star must have a lifetime at least as long as the time between its formation and the present day.

    Age of universe ≈ 1.40e+10 years
    Formation time  ≈ 4.86e+08 years

Thus, the required stellar lifetime is:

Substitute the value of T:

A possible solution is to use relativistic light sails: tiny probes propelled by radiation pressure. In the Earth observer's reference frame, a sail takes 65.0 years to reach Barnard's Star, which is 8.95 light-years away. Assume the sail travels at constant speed. How long does the trip take in the reference frame of the light sail?","Step 1: Compute the sail speed in units of c.
Because 1 light-year per year equals the speed of light, we have:
v/c = (distance in ly) / (time in years)

v/c = 8.95 / 65.0 = 0.138

Thus,
v = 0.138c

Step 2: Compute the Lorentz factor γ for this speed.
γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2)

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.138^2) = 1.010

Step 3: Use time dilation to find the proper time on the sail.
The Earth-frame time is dilated relative to the proper time on the sail:
Δt_sail = Δt_Earth / γ

Δt_sail = 65.0 / 1.010 = 64.38 years

The star’s spectrum showed a periodic Doppler shift, indicating that its radial velocity varied sinusoidally. The measured radial-velocity semi-amplitude is 67 m/s with a period of 3.29 days, and the star’s mass is 1.26 M⊙. Assuming the orbit is circular and viewed edge-on (sin i = 1), what is the planet’s mass in Jupiter masses?","Step 1: Use Kepler’s Third Law to relate the orbital size to the period.
Assuming the planet is much less massive than the star (m_p ≪ M_s), we approximate:
a^3 = (G M_s T^2) / (4π^2)

Convert the period to seconds:
T = 3.29 days × 86400 s/day = 2.844e+05 s

Convert the stellar mass to kilograms:
M_s = 1.26 M⊙ = 2.504e+30 kg

Solve for the orbital radius:
a = [G M_s T^2 / (4π^2)]^(1/3) = 6.995e+09 m

Step 2: Compute the planet’s orbital speed (circular orbit).
v_p = 2πa / T

v_p = 2π(6.995e+09 m) / (2.844e+05 s) = 1.546e+05 m/s

Step 3: Use conservation of momentum about the center of mass.
For two bodies orbiting their common center of mass:
M_s v_s = m_p v_p

For an edge-on orbit, the measured RV semi-amplitude equals the star’s orbital speed:
v_s = K = 67.16 m/s

d = 1 / p(arcsec)

Convert p from mas to arcsec:
p = 6.27 mas = 0.00627 arcsec

Thus,
d = 1 / 0.00627 = 159.5665 pc

Step 2: The projected physical separation at maximum angular separation is:
a = d·θ

Convert θ from mas to arcsec:
θ = 5.63 mas = 0.00563 arcsec

Since 1 arcsec at d(pc) corresponds to d AU:
a = (159.5665)·(0.00563) AU

At the tube intersection, y = 0.0 m, so:
0.0 = x^2 / 25 + (-2.3)

Solve for x^2:
x^2 / 25 = 0.0 - (-2.3) = 2.3
x^2 = 25 · (2.3) = 57.262

Thus, the mirror edge is at:

What is the minimal possible ratio of the semi-major axis of planet A to that of planet B?","Step 1: To minimize the ratio of semi-major axes, the orbits must be at the limit of touching each other.

Using the expressions for periapsis and apoapsis:

Both asteroids have the same angular velocity about the center of mass.

If the cluster has physical radius R_C and is at distance d, its angular diameter is approximately

θ = 2R_C / d

For a circular aperture, the Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolution:

θ_res = 1.22 λ / D

The volume of the human must first be converted to cubic meters:

$$V = 61266 \times 10^{-6} = 6.1266e-02\,\mathrm{m^3}.$$

The power per unit volume is then

$$u = \frac{113}{6.1266e-02} = 1839\,\mathrm{W/m^3}.$$

Step 2: Compute the total power output of the Sun at this power density.

The volume of the Sun is $\frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3$, so the total power is

$$P = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3 u.$$

Step 3: Relate the power output to the surface temperature using blackbody radiation.

The radiated power from the Sun’s surface is

a_t = (a_E + a_M)/2
a_t = ( 1.469e+08 + 2.297e+08 )/2 = 1.883e+08 km

Step 2: The heliocentric speed on the transfer orbit at Earth's distance (vis-viva equation) is

v1 = sqrt( 1.327e+11 (2/1.469e+08 − 1/1.883e+08) ) = 33.189 km/s

    Using the relation between the telescope aperture D and the wavelength λ, first determine the aperture of the objective.

    D = 1.22 * λ / θ = 1.22 * 550 * 10^-9 / (1.2407434672775652 / 3600 * π / 180) = 11.2 cm.

Approximate the asteroid as a uniform sphere:
M = (4/3)πr^3 ρ
Diameter = 8.32 km = 8.323e+03 m, so r = 4.162e+03 m
ρ = 2.82 g/cm^3 = 2.819e+03 kg/m^3
M = (4/3)π(4.162e+03)^3(2.819e+03) = 8.511e+14 kg

Step 2: Find the speed needed to stay gravitationally bound near the surface.
Using the vis-viva equation for a circular orbit (a = r):
v^2 = μ(2/r − 1/a) with μ = GM  ⇒  for a = r:  v = sqrt(GM/r)
v = sqrt((6.67430e-11)(8.511e+14)/(4.162e+03)) = 3.695 m/s

So set the comet period T = 250 years, and perihelion distance q = 0.874 AU.

Using Kepler’s third law relative to Earth:
  (a / a_Earth)^3 = (T / T_Earth)^2.
With a_Earth = 1 AU and T_Earth = 1 year, this becomes:
  a^3 = T^2  =>  a = T^(2/3).

Thus the semi-major axis is:
  a = (250)^(2/3) AU ≈ 39.685 AU.

Step 2: For an elliptical orbit, perihelion q and aphelion Q satisfy:
  q + Q = 2a.
So the aphelion distance is:
  Q = 2a − q = 2×39.685 − 0.874 AU ≈ 78.496 AU.

Therefore, the maximum possible aphelion distance is about 78.5 AU.",[Answer] 78.5 AU,No,"{

374,The thermonuclear reactions of the Sun cause a decrease in the Sun’s mass. Please calculate the increase in the Earth's orbital radius over 227 years resulting from this mass loss. Assume that the Earth maintains a perfectly circular orbit during this process.,"Step 1: Use Einstein’s mass–energy relation to relate luminosity and mass loss.
L_sun = -dE/dt = -(dM/dt)c^2  =>  dM/dt = -L_sun / c^2.

Substitute the constants:
dM/dt = -(3.83e+26) / (3.00e+08)^2 kg/s
     ≈ -4.26e+09 kg/s.

Step 2: For a circular orbit, v^2 = GM/r. If the orbit remains circular and angular momentum
is conserved (l = mrv = constant), then r ∝ 1/M.
Therefore:
dr/dt = - r (dM/dt) / M.

dr/dt = -(1.496e+11) * (-4.26e+09) / (1.99e+30) m/s
     ≈ 3.20e-10 m/s.

Step 3: Over the time interval Δt, the increase in orbital radius is
Δr ≈ (dr/dt)Δt.
Here Δt = 227 years = 7.159e+09 s.

Δr ≈ (3.20e-10) * (7.159e+09) m

If it would have the same apparent brightness as the Sun were it located at a distance of 500 pc, and assuming a Hubble constant of 65 km/(s·Mpc), calculate the luminosity of this quasar (in units of the Sun’s luminosity).","Step 1: Convert redshift z to recession speed v/c (relativistic Doppler formula):
v/c = [ (1+z)^2 − 1 ] / [ (1+z)^2 + 1 ]
v/c = [ (1+0.25)^2 − 1 ] / [ (1+0.25)^2 + 1 ] = 0.220

Step 2: Use Hubble’s law v = H0 D to estimate the distance:
v = (v/c) c = (0.220) × (3.00e+05 km/s) = 6.59e+04 km/s
D = v / H0 = (6.59e+04) / (65) = 1013 Mpc

Step 3: Use the inverse-square law expressed in magnitudes.
If the quasar would match the Sun’s apparent brightness at distance d0, then at distance D:
m_quasar − m_sun = 5 log10(D/d0), with D and d0 in the same distance units.
Convert D to pc: D = 1013 Mpc = 1.01e+09 pc
m_quasar = m_sun + 5 log10(D/d0)
m_quasar = (-26.8) + 5 log10((1.01e+09)/(500))
m_quasar = 4.73

Step 4: Convert to absolute magnitude using the distance modulus (D in Mpc):
m − M = 5 log10(D_Mpc) + 25  ⇒  M = m − 5 log10(D_Mpc) − 25
M = 4.73 − 5 log10(1013) − 25 = -35.29

Step 5: Convert absolute magnitude to luminosity:
M − M_sun = −2.5 log10(L/L_sun)
log10(L/L_sun) = (M_sun − M)/2.5 = (4.75 − (-35.29)) / 2.5 = 16.02

409,"A black hole (BH) forms from the gravitational collapse of a massive star. Nothing that crosses the event horizon, located at the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, can escape.

If quantum effects are considered, black holes emit Hawking radiation. Assume that this radiation consists of photons with a blackbody spectrum that peaks at a wavelength $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\mathrm{SC}}$.

It is known that the Schwarzschild radius of a solar-mass black hole is $R_{\mathrm{SC,\odot}} = 2.952\,\mathrm{km}$.

1) Derive an expression for the black hole temperature $T_\mathrm{bh}$ in terms of its mass $M_\mathrm{bh}$ and physical constants.
2) Calculate $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ and $T_\mathrm{bh}$ for a black hole of mass 19.7061 $M_\odot$.","Solution:

Step 1: Use Wien’s displacement law.
The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is related to temperature by
\[
\lambda_{\rm peak} = \frac{b}{T}, \qquad b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m\,K}.
\]
Given $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, the temperature is
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b}{16 R_{\rm SC}}.
\]

Step 2: Express the Schwarzschild radius in terms of mass.
For a black hole,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = \frac{2 G M_{\rm bh}}{c^2}.
\]
Substituting into the temperature expression gives
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{2(16) G M_{\rm bh}}.
\]
For $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, this becomes
\[
\boxed{T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{32 G M_{\rm bh}}}.
\]

Step 3: Compute the Schwarzschild radius for the given mass.
Since $R_{\rm SC}$ scales linearly with mass,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = (2.952\,\mathrm{km}) \times (19.7061) = 58.172\,\mathrm{km}.
\]

Step 4: Compute the black hole temperature.
Convert the radius to meters:
\[
R_{\rm SC} = 5.817e+04\,\mathrm{m}.
\]
Then the peak wavelength is
\[
\lambda_{\rm bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC} = 9.308e+05\,\mathrm{m}.
\]
Using Wien’s law,
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{9.308e+05} \approx 3.114e-09\,\mathrm{K}.

411,"A faint subdwarf star (I = 19.8 mag) in the Galactic bulge was observed to brighten to I' = 16.4 mag due to gravitational microlensing, allowing a high-resolution spectrum to be obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (mirror diameter 10.0 m).

Estimate the diameter of a telescope needed to obtain a spectrum of the same quality with the same instrument and exposure time for this star at its normal apparent brightness.","Step 1: Determine the microlensing magnification.
Let F be the unmagnified flux of the star. During microlensing, the flux is increased by a factor A. The relation between magnitude and flux is:

    m1 − m2 = −2.5 log10(F1 / F2)

Applying this to the unlensed and lensed magnitudes:

    I − I' = −2.5 log10(F / (A F)) = 2.5 log10 A

Thus:

    A = 10^((19.8 − 16.4) / 2.5) ≈ 23

Step 2: Relate flux collection to telescope diameter.
The number of photons collected per unit time is proportional to the collecting area, and hence to the square of the mirror diameter. Let D be the required telescope diameter.

To collect the same number of photons from the unlensed star as the reference telescope does from the lensed star:

    F D^2 = A F D_ref^2

Final Answer: A telescope with a diameter of approximately 48 m is required.",48 m,No,"{
  ""solution"": ""To estimate the required telescope diameter, we start by calculating the flux ratio between the normal and microlensed brightness.

This means the star was 22.96 times brighter during microlensing.\n\nSince the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) depends on the number of photons collected, and S/N is proportional to √(flux * area), the same S/N requires the same total photons. With the same exposure time and instrument, the area (proportional to D²) must compensate for the reduced flux. Thus, the required area ratio is A' / A = 22.96. Solving for the new diameter: (D' / 10 m)² = 22.96 → D' = 10 m * √22.96 ≈ 10 m * 4.792 ≈ 47.92 m. Rounding to a reasonable estimate gives 48 m."",

Assume a spacecraft of mass 5.17e+02 kg impacts head-on and sticks to a moon orbiting a larger asteroid. Before impact, the moon orbited on a circular orbit with period P = 13.55 h. The masses of the moon and the primary asteroid are m = 7.69e+09 kg and M = 7.29e+11 kg, respectively. The spacecraft’s impact speed relative to the moon was 6.32 km/s.

Assuming the collision is central and perfectly inelastic, and neglecting external gravitational influences, calculate the expected change in the orbital period of the moon (in minutes).","Step 1: Determine the initial orbital radius and velocity.
Because the primary asteroid is much more massive than the moon, we treat the moon as orbiting a fixed central mass. From Kepler’s third law:

    a^3 / P^2 = GM / (4π^2)

Solving for a gives a = 1.431e+03 m. The corresponding orbital speed is:

    v0 = 2πa / P

which yields v0 = 1.844e-01 m/s.

Step 2: Apply conservation of linear momentum during the collision.
For a perfectly inelastic, head-on collision:

    m v0 − m_s v_s = (m + m_s) v'

Since m_s << m, this can be approximated as:

    v' ≈ v0 − (m_s / m) v_s

Using the vis-viva equation and expanding to first order, the fractional change in the semi-major axis is:

    Δa / a ≈ −2 (m_s / m) (v_s / v0)

Numerically, Δa / a = -4.604e-03.

Step 3: Relate the change in semi-major axis to the change in orbital period.
For Keplerian motion:

    ΔP / P = (3/2) (Δa / a)

This gives ΔP / P = -6.906e-03, corresponding to a decrease of 0.69%.

The field of view corresponds to the angle subtended by the sensor at the focal point of the lens.

Step 2: Model the geometry as a right-angled triangle.
Half of the sensor width forms the opposite side, and the focal length forms the adjacent side. Therefore, the half-angle of the field of view is given by:

The camera is pointed at a star field located at the observer’s zenith.

What is the maximum possible exposure time for a single frame such that no visible star trails appear on the image?","Step 1: Determine the number of pixels across the sensor.

The pixel size is 2.65 μm = 0.002651 mm.
The number of pixels across the sensor is:

$N = \frac{\text{Sensor width}}{\text{Pixel size}} = \frac{32.15}{0.002651} = 12128.71 \approx 12129$

The angular field of view of the lens is approximated by:

Step 2: Relate Earth’s rotation to the allowable exposure time.

The Earth completes a full $360^\circ$ rotation in 23.9344 hours. To limit star motion to one pixel, the exposure time must correspond to an angular rotation equal to one pixel:

$t = \theta_{\text{pixel}} \times \frac{T_{\oplus}}{360^\circ}$\n\nConverting to seconds:

The solar constant is $S_\odot = 1384\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$. The Earth's central axis precesses with a period of 26441 years and traces a circle of angular radius 23.8^\circ$. Initially, the Sun is located at the zenith. Determine how many years it will take for the Earth's equilibrium temperature to decrease by $\Delta T = 0.5^\circ\mathrm{C}$.","Step 1:
Let $A$ be the surface area of one side of the flat Earth. If the Sun makes an angle $\theta$ with the Earth's axis, the absorbed solar power is
$$P_{\rm in} = S_\odot A \cos\theta.$$

The Earth radiates as a blackbody from both sides, so the emitted power is
$$P_{\rm out} = 2 A \sigma T^4.$$

At equilibrium, $P_{\rm in} = P_{\rm out}$, giving
$$T(\theta) = \left( \frac{S_\odot \cos\theta}{2\sigma} \right)^{1/4}.$$

Step 2:
We seek the angle $\theta_1$ such that
$$T(\theta_1) = T(0) - \Delta T.$$

This leads to
$$\cos\theta_1 = \left(1 - \Delta T \left(\frac{2\sigma}{S_\odot}\right)^{1/4} \right)^4.$$

Step 3:
The Earth's axis precesses on a cone of half-angle $\varepsilon$. Using the spherical law of cosines for the precession geometry,
$$\cos\theta_1 = \cos^2\varepsilon + \sin^2\varepsilon \cos\Phi,$$

Based on these data, the human eye can distinguish details separated by 10 cm at a distance of 0.9 km, whereas the 2.16-meter telescope can extend this capability to more than 300 km. However, this is an ideal situation considering only the diffraction limit. In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability. In astronomy, the degradation of stellar image quality and resolution caused by atmospheric turbulence and scattering is called *seeing*, and the size of the seeing disk is used to evaluate the atmospheric optical quality at a telescope site. Even at observatory sites with excellent seeing, the seeing disk can still reach about 1”. In modern cities, sky light pollution is severe: not only is the resolution extremely poor, but even the basic “ability to see” is greatly diminished. People who have never left large cities have never seen the magnificent sight of a star-studded sky, nor have they appreciated the beauty of the bright Milky Way. Lacking direct experience inevitably weakens one’s affection for nature and spirit of exploration. <image>JSTL-Fig-1</image> As shown in the figure, some computed data under the assumption of exceptionally good atmospheric conditions are listed.

Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

This is a square sail with a size length of $l=50$ m, a mass of $m=2.0$ kg, and a reflectivity of $\eta=85\%.$ The remaining $15\%$ of the photons are absorbed by the sail. In order to simplify the calculations, only take into account the gravity and radiation pressure from the Sun, and assume that the sail is initially stationary with respect to the Sun. Estimate how long it would take for this sail to reach Jupiter's orbit. Feel free to make reasonable approximations if needed, but be sure to state and justify any approximations you make.","Step1: The radiation pressure is a result of the momentum of the photons, which is given by the following expression:

$p=\frac{E}{c}$

Where $p$ corresponds to the momentum, $E$ is the energy of the photon, and $c$ is the speed of light.

Since the momentum is conserved after the collision of the photons with the sail, it is possible to write the following expression for the radiation pressure on the sail.

Get:

$P_r=(1+\eta)\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}$

Where $P_r$ is the radiation pressure and $F_{\odot}$ is the Solar flux. Note that the $1+\eta$ term comes from the fact that a fraction $\eta$ of the photons being reflected causes a momentum in the opposite direction to their motion before the collision with the sail.

Step2: In order to preserve the momentum, the sail needs to end up with $1+\eta$ times the initial momentum to account for the reflected photons.

Taking into account both the radiation pressure and the gravity, it is possible to find an expression for the acceleration $a$ as a function of the distance $r$ to the Sun.

Get:

$ma=(1+\eta)A\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$ma=(1+\eta)l^{2}\frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^{2}c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$a=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{(1+\eta)l^{2}L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm}-GM_{\odot}\right)$

$k=\frac{(1+\eta)l^2L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm} - GM_{\odot}=\frac{(1+0.85)\cdot 50^2\cdot 3.827\cdot 10^{26}}{4\pi \cdot 2.998\cdot 10^8 \cdot 2.0}-6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\cdot 1.989\cdot 10^{30}=1.0\cdot 10^{20} m^3 s^{-2}$

Step3: Using the definition of acceleration and the chain rule

Get:

$a=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}t}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}\mathrm{d}r=v\mathrm{d}v$

Step4: Integrating to find the velocity of the sail.

Get:

$\int_{R_{\odot}}^{r}\frac{k}{u^2}\mathrm{d}u=\int_{0}^{v}v\mathrm{d}v$

$\frac{v^2}{2}=k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)$

$v=\sqrt{2k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)}$

Step5: Since the radius of Jupiter’s orbit is much larger than the the radius of the Sun, for most of the trajectory, the velocity of the sail is approximately the following:

$v\approx \sqrt{\frac{2k}{R_{\odot}}}=5.4\cdot 10^5\ \mathrm{m/s}$

This is because the term $\frac{1}{r}$ is negligible compared to $\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}$ for most of the trajectory. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the time to travel to Jupiter as follows.

Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$. We now rearrange for $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\ell}{a}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\ell}{a}$. Plugging in $\frac{\ell}{a} = 0.01$

439,"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star. This wind-fed accretion is especially significant in systems that include an early-type star (such as an O or B star, indicated henceforth as an OB star), alongside a compact object like a neutron star (NS) in a close orbit. Consider such a NS-OB star binary system where a neutron star of mass $M_{\mathrm{NS}}=2.0\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and radius $R_\mathrm{NS}=11$ km is orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $a$ around the centre of the OB star with velocity $v_\mathrm{orb}=1.5\times10^{5}ms^{-1}$ (<image>JSTL-Fig-11</image>as shown in the figure). Throughout this problem the mass loss from the OB star is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its rate is $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{OB}}=1.0\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.

The accretion radius, $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the maximum distance from the NS at which the stellar wind can be captured by the NS. If the stellar wind speed at the orbital distance of the NS is $v_\mathrm{w}=3.0\times10^6m s^{-1}$, find $R_\mathrm{acc}$ for the above system in km using standard escape velocity calculations.","Step1: The accretion radius can be estimated by equating the gravitational potential energy of the stellar wind to its kinetic energy

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{w}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = \frac{G M_{\mathrm{NS}} \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\mathrm{acc}}}\Longrightarrow \quad R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}}$

where, $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the wind density and $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity of the wind.

Get:

For the case considered above $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} + v_{\mathrm{orb}}^{2}$

440,"<image>JSTL-Fig-12</image>As shown in the figure, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has released an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87 galaxy. To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

where $r\in(R_{\mathrm{SC}},\infty)$ is the radial coordinate, $\phi\in[0,2\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle, and $E$ and $L$ are constants related to the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum, respectively. Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem. Another useful equation is obtained by differentiating the first equation: $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

Circular light trajectories can exist around the black hole. Find the radius, $r_{\rm ph}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\rm ph}$, for such photon trajectories in terms of $M$ and relevant constants.","Step1: Circular trajectories have $r = \mathrm{constant}$. Hence, the radial velocity $v_r = 0$ and rate of change of radial component of velocity $\frac{dv_r}{dt} = 0$. From the third equation, $\frac{dv_r}{dt} - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0,$

When the positions and redshifts of all the galaxies in this cluster were measured, an interesting distribution emerged. As shown in the figure. <image>JSTL-Fig-13</image>

Using these observations, estimate the total mass of the galaxy cluster and express your answer in solar masses. Assume that this galaxy cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, with a root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_{z}=\sqrt{\langle(z-0.7)^{2}\rangle}=0.0005$. Feel free to make reasonable approximations when considering the average velocities, masses, and spatial distribution of the galaxies. Consider that the distance to $\bar{z}=0.7$ in the standard cosmological model is $D_{A}=1500$ Mpc. Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion. Notice, however, that only the dispersion in redshift is given, which translates into a radial velocity dispersion: $\sigma_{v_{r}}=c\cdot\sigma_{z}=2.998\times10^{8}\:\mathrm{m/s}\times0.0005=1.499\times10^{5}\:\mathrm{m/s}$

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

We simulate a halo number density field by taking $n(\mathbf{x}) = \bar{n}\max(0,1+b\delta_m(\mathbf{x}))$, where bare number density $\bar{n}$ and bare bias $b$ are specified constants. What is the bias of the sampled halo field? Derive an equation to evaluate the bias which depends on the bare bias and the variance in each pixel.","Step1:
**Detailed Steps**.

The solution to this question involves some domain knowledge, parts of which were given in the problem's statement, some approximations sourced by the domain knowledge, and some mathematical calculations. The domain knowledge is very basic and should be known to anyone in the field. Approximations are intuitive and also, mostly, inspired by the domain knowledge. Following Polya, we can organize it as follows:

Step2:
**Understand the problem.**

The number density of halos $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:

$\begin{equation}N_h = \int_{V} n_h(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}.\end{equation}$


The overdensity is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{n_h(\mathbf{x})-\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}{\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}.\end{equation}$

Linear bias is defined in terms of Fourier-transformed quantities:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{k}) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k}).\end{equation}$

This is an approximation that holds on sufficiently large scales (small $k$). $\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$ and $\delta_h(\mathbf{k})$ are Gaussian random fields with zero mean and their variance depends only on the magnitude of the wave-vector $k=|\mathbf{k}|$:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{mm}(k)),\ \delta_h \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{hh}(k)).\end{equation}$

The quantity $P(k)$ is called the power spectrum and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{k})\delta(\mathbf{k'})\rangle = (2\pi)^3\delta^D(\mathbf{k+k'})P(k).\end{equation}$

It immediately follows that:

$\begin{equation}P_{hh}(k) = b^2P_{mm}(k).\end{equation}$

We are given the expression in real space. In real space, the quantity $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$ is also a Gaussian random field:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_m),\ \delta_h(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_h).\end{equation}$

Quantity $\xi$ is called a two-point (real-space) correlation function and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x'})\rangle = \xi(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|).\end{equation}$

This quantity is sufficiently small when $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|\gg1$. We are asked to find what is the expression for $b$ in the equation $\delta_h(k) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$, given the real-space expression for the number density $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of real-space sample of $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$.

Step3:
**Devise a plan.**

The key point to solve this problem should be that real-space correlation function for halos $\xi_h$ should also be equal to $b^2\xi_m$. We want to calculate that correlation function. It should be expressed in terms of $\langle n(\mathbf{x})\rangle$ and $\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})n_h(\mathbf{x'})\rangle$. We expect to be able to calculate these expectations since they are the expectations of functions of the Gaussian random variables. We are given the pixel variance $\sigma$. How does it connect to the other quantities we know? In principle, that's also the part of domain knowledge but it also can be deducted from the definitions already given. A discretized version of the correlation function is:

$\begin{equation}\xi_{ij} = \langle\delta_{\mathbf{x_i}}\delta_{\mathbf{x_j}}\rangle.\end{equation}$

When $i=j$, it becomes the pixel variance $\sigma$. \textit{Aside, we could have given instead of $\sigma$, the quantity $P_{mm}(k)$, that is a common description of a cosmological dark-matter field. In that case, from the definitions of $\xi(r)$ and $P_{mm}(k)$, we could have deduced that $\sigma = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{k}P_{mm}(k)$}. Then we pick the ensemble of all the pixels at given fixed large distance $r=|\mathbf{x_i}-\mathbf{x_j}|$. The key is to recognize that it is fully described by a correlated bivariate Gaussian distribution.

$\begin{equation}(\delta^m_{i},\delta^m_{j}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma) \end{equation}$

with a covariance

$\begin{equation}\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2 & \xi^m_r  \\ \xi^m_r & \sigma^2 \end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}$

In general, the integrals from the expectation values are cumbersome, but we should expect some simplifications from the fact that $\xi$ is small and we can Taylor-expand the pdf.

Step4:
**Carry out the plan.**

It's more convenient to define $\hat{\delta}_{i} = \delta^m_i/\sigma$ and $\hat{\xi} = \xi^m_r/\sigma^2$, and $\phi_2$ - a correlated bivariate Gaussian pdf - then

$\begin{equation}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2(1-\hat{\xi}^2)}[\hat{\delta}^2_{i}+\hat{\delta}^2_{j}-2\hat{\xi}\hat{\delta}_{i}\hat{\delta}_{j}]}}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\hat{\xi}^2}} \equiv \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}).\end{equation}$

We note that

$\begin{equation}\xi^{n}_r = \frac{\langle n_in_j\rangle}{\langle n \rangle^2}-1.\end{equation}$

The quantity $\langle n\rangle$ is the actual mean number density:

$\begin{equation}\bar{n}^{'} = \langle n \rangle = \langle n_i \rangle = \int n^{loc}(\delta_i,b,\bar{n}) \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}) d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j} = \int n^{loc}_i \phi_1(\hat{\delta_i})d\hat{\delta_i}.\end{equation}$

Here, $\phi_1$ - is a standard normal pdf. It is expected that it's not dependent on the correlation $\hat{\xi}$, but only on $b$ and $\sigma$, just as the marginal of 2D correlated Gaussian distribution is 1D Gaussian that's not dependent on the cross-correlation. To the linear order in $\hat{\xi}$,

$\begin{equation}\phi_2(x,y|\hat{\xi}) \approx \phi_1(x)\phi_1(y)(1+\hat{\xi}xy).\end{equation}$

So that the two-point function neatly factorizes:

$$\begin{aligned}&\langle n_{i}n_{j}\rangle=\int n^{loc}(\delta_{i},b,\bar{n})n^{loc}(\delta_{j},b,\bar{n})\phi_{2}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi})d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\approx\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})d\hat{\delta}_{j}+\hat{\xi}\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})\hat{\delta}_{j}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\equiv\langle n\rangle^{2}+\hat{\xi}\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^{2}.\end{aligned}$$


Substituting the results for $\langle n\rangle$ and $\langle n_in_j\rangle$ in  the equation for $\xi^n_r$, we can read off the bias:

$\begin{equation}b^{'2} = \frac{\xi^n_r}{\sigma^2\hat{\xi}} = \frac{\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^2}{\sigma^2\langle n\rangle^2}.\end{equation}$


All that is left is to calculate the expectations. One can evaluate for $b\geq0$


$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta_{i}})d\hat{\delta_{i}}=\int\bar{n}\max(0,1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\int_{-\frac{1}{b\sigma}}^{+\infty}(1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)+b\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

For $b<0$ it's, however, 

$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\bar{n}\int_{-\infty}^{+\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}}(1-|b|\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

So we conclude that the latter expression is valid for all $b$. Similarly, one can show that

$\begin{equation}\langle n\hat{\delta }\rangle = \bar{n}\int\max(0,1+b\sigma x)x\phi_1(x)dx = \bar{n}b\sigma \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\end{equation}$

where $\Phi_1(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x\phi_1(x)dx$ - normal cdf. Finally, one can get

$\begin{equation}\boxed{b^{'} = \frac{b \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}{\Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}}.\end{equation}$

Note: We also accept solutions as correct if they omit the $|~|$ around the bias, since halo bias is usually positive.

which involves the trace over $x_{1}$ states.","Step1: Diagonalize the original Hamiltonian

\begin{align}
H & =(x_{1}\quad x_{2}\quad p_{1}\quad p_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k+g}{2} & -\frac{g}{2}\\
-\frac{g}{2} & \frac{k+g}{2}\\

\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
p_{1}\\

Step2: One easily finds

$\begin{equation}
x_{1}=\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x1}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
x_{2}=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x2}
\end{equation}$

Step3: diagonalizes the Hamiltonian such that in the $(y_{1},y_{2},q_{1}\equiv m\dot{y}_{1},q_{2}\equiv m\dot{y}_{2})$ basis, it is

\begin{align}
H & =(y_{1}\quad y_{2}\quad q_{1}\quad q_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k}{2} & 0\\
0 & \frac{k}{2}+g\\

\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
q_{1}\\

Step4: The ladder operators are

$\begin{equation}
a_{j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}y_{j}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}}q_{j}\right)
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\omega_{2}^{2}=\frac{k+2g}{m}

Step5: which allows one to rewrite the Hamiltonian as

$\begin{equation}
H=\sum_{j=1}^{2}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{j}\omega_{j}+\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{2}.
\end{equation}$

Step6: In this basis, we denote the ground state as

$\begin{equation}
a_{1}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=0=a_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}.
\end{equation}$

Step7: Hence we have found $|\Omega\rangle=|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}$. We know that the wave function in the $\vec{y}$ coordinates is the product of well known simple harmonic oscillator solutions:

$\begin{equation}
\langle y'_{1},y'_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{2}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]
\end{equation}$

where

$\begin{equation}
b_{n}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{n}}}
\end{equation}$

Step8: making this a convenient basis to work with. Note

\begin{align*}
\hat{y}_{1}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right) & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'\hat{y}_{1}|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\

 & =\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step9: where we used the completeness of the basis, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:x1}) and (\ref{eq:x2}), and the usual delta function normalization of the position basis. This and a similar relation for $\hat{y}_{2}$ imply

$\begin{equation}
\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}=\left|\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}$

Step10: This means

$\begin{equation}
\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\right)=\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\rangle=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].
\end{equation}$

Step11: The partial trace is defined through the following contraction of $(2,2)$ tensor to a $(1,1)$ tensor: 

\begin{align*}

Step12: Integrate over $w$, we find

\begin{align*}

Step13: Next, to identify the matrix, use

$\begin{equation}

\begin{align}
\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\langle v|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\

Step16: where

$\begin{equation}
\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!b_{3}\sqrt{\pi}2^{n}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{3}^{2}}}H_{n}\left(\frac{x_{1}'}{b_{3}}\right)

are the well known oscillator wave functions and $b_{3}$ still has to be chosen. One can show by carrying out the integrals that the
matrix is diagonalized if

Step2: For the slow-roll inflation, the following must hold:

3 \sqrt{\frac{V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right]}{3 M_P^2}} \frac{d\phi}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{1}{M_P} \right) V_0 \exp \left[ - \sqrt{\frac{2}{q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right]
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\int \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{V_0}} \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3q}} t \,.
\end{equation}$

Step6: Performing the integration and solving for $\phi(t)$ we get

$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{V_0}} M_P \sqrt{2q} \left( \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi}{M_P} \right) \right] - \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi_0}{M_P} \right) \right] \right) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3q}} t
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\phi = \sqrt{2q} M_P \ln \left\{ \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi_0}{M_P} \right) \right] + \frac{1}{M_P q} \sqrt{\frac{V_0}{3}} t \right\}}.
\end{equation}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{\phi = \sqrt{2q} M_P \ln \left\{ \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi_0}{M_P} \right) \right] + \frac{1}{M_P q} \sqrt{\frac{V_0}{3}} t \right\}.}$",$\boxed{\phi = \sqrt{2q} M_P \ln \left\{ \exp \left[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2q}} \left( \frac{\phi_0}{M_P} \right) \right] + \frac{1}{M_P q} \sqrt{\frac{V_0}{3}} t \right\}.}$,No,,0.952
458,"Consider the theory

$\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+|\partial\phi|^{2}-|F|^{2}
\end{equation}$

where $\xi$ is a 2-component Weyl spinor while $\phi$ and $F$ are complex scalar fields. Suppose you want to make the following infinitesimal transformation a symmetry of this theory:

$\begin{equation}
\delta_{\eta}\xi_{\alpha}=i\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}^{\mu}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\partial_{\mu}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta_{\alpha}F
\end{equation}$

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\beta}} & = [i\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\beta\dot{\alpha}}^{\mu}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\partial_{\mu}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta_{\beta}F]^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}(\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\sigma_{\dot{\alpha}\beta}^{\mu*})^{*}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}+\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\beta}}\bar{F}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}\eta^{\alpha}\sigma_{\alpha\dot{\beta}}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}+\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\beta}}\bar{F}\numberthis
\end{align*}

$\begin{equation}
\delta_{\eta}F=i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu\dot{\alpha}\alpha}\partial_{\mu}\xi_{\alpha}=i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi
\end{equation}$

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\bar{F} & = -i\sqrt{2}(\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi)^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}(\partial_{\mu}\xi)^{\dagger}(\bar{\sigma}^{\mu})^{\dagger}(\bar{\eta})^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta\numberthis
\end{align*}

along with $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ where $\eta$ is a spacetime-independent infinitesimal fermionic parameter inducing the transformation. Find the transformation rule $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ for the action associated with $\mathcal{L}$ to remain invariant.","Denoting the variation $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ as $\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}$, we write 

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & = i\delta_{\eta}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi-\delta_{\eta}\bar{F}F-\bar{F}\delta_{\eta}F\\
 & = i[-i\sqrt{2}\eta\sigma^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\bar{\phi}+\cancel{\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{F}}]\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}[i\sqrt{2}\sigma^{\beta}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\beta}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta F]\\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi-[-i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta]F-\cancel{\bar{F}[i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi]}\,.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Integrating by parts, we find (denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms)

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\eta\sigma^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\bar{\phi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}[\sqrt{2}\sigma^{\beta}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\beta}\phi-\cancel{i\sqrt{2}\eta F}]\nonumber \\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi+\cancel{i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta F} \,.
\end{align}

Integrate by parts the first two terms to eliminate the the $\sigma$ matrices using the identity $\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\sigma^{\nu}+\bar{\sigma}^{\nu}\sigma^{\mu}=2g^{\mu\nu}$:

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\left(\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial^{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)\nonumber \\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi
\end{align}

again denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms, and we are using the standard notation $\eta\xi\equiv\eta^{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\equiv\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}$.

To make the remainder cancel, we solve

$\begin{equation}
\sqrt{2}\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi=0
\end{equation}$

yielding

$\begin{equation}
\boxed{\delta_{\eta}\phi=-\sqrt{2}\eta\xi,\quad\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}=-\sqrt{2}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}}.\label{eq:L4-susy}
\end{equation}$

Final_answer: $\begin{equation}
\boxed{\delta_{\eta}\phi=-\sqrt{2}\eta\xi,\quad\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}=-\sqrt{2}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}}.\label{eq:L4-susy}
