2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

  ""solution"": 
  # Step 1: Define the virial and the forces acting on a single molecule
  The virial is defined as the sum of the inner product of the position vector and the resultant force of all forces acting on a single molecule over all molecules in the system. Let's denote the position vector of the i-th molecule as r_i and the resultant force acting on it as F_i.

  # Step 2: Express the resultant force F_i in terms of the forces acting on the i-th molecule
  According to Newton's second law, the resultant force F_i acting on the i-th molecule can be expressed as the sum of the forces acting on it by all other molecules in the system, as well as any external forces. We can denote the force acting on the i-th molecule by the j-th molecule as F_ij.

  # Step 3: Express the inner product r_i \* F_i in terms of the forces acting on the i-th molecule
  The inner product r_i \* F_i can be expressed as the sum of the inner products of the position vector r_i and the forces F_ij acting on the i-th molecule by all other molecules in the system, as well as any external forces.

  # Step 4: Derive the formula for the virial
  The virial is the sum of the inner product r_i \* F_i over all molecules in the system. By expressing the inner product r_i \* F_i in terms of the forces acting on the i-th molecule and summing over all molecules, we can derive the formula for the virial.

  # Step 5: Derive the virial theorem
  The virial theorem states that the time average of the virial is equal to minus twice the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system. We can derive this theorem by considering the time average of the virial and the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system.

  # Step 6: Express the time average of the virial in terms of the time average of the forces and the position vectors
  The time average of the virial can be expressed as the sum of the time average of the inner product r_i \* F_i over all molecules in the system.

  # Step 7: Express the time average of the inner product r_i \* F_i in terms of the time average of the forces and the position vectors
  The time average of the inner product r_i \* F_i can be expressed as the sum of the time average of the inner product of the position vector r_i and the force F_ij acting on the i-th molecule by the j-th molecule, as well as any external forces.

  # Step 8: Derive the formula for the virial theorem
  By expressing the time average of the virial in terms of the time average of the forces and the position vectors, and equating it to minus twice the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system, we can derive the formula for the virial theorem.

  # Step 9: Simplify the formula for the virial theorem
  The formula for the virial theorem can be simplified by considering the properties of the time average of the forces and the position vectors.

  # Step 10: Express the virial theorem in a more compact form
  The virial theorem can be expressed in a more compact form by using the notation of the potential energy of the system.

  # The final formula for the virial theorem is:
  The time average of the virial (2) is equal to minus twice the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system (K).
  This can be expressed as:
  <2T> = -<U>
  where T is the total kinetic energy of the system, U is the potential energy of the system, and < > denotes the time average.

  # The final formula for the potential energy of the system is:
  U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{N} \frac{m_i m_j}{|r_i - r_j|}

  # The final formula for the kinetic energy of the system is:
  T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{m_i v_i^2}{2}
  where m_i is the mass of the i-th molecule, v_i is the velocity of the i-th molecule, and N is the number of molecules in the system.

  The given equation is the dynamical equation for each body in an N-body system. It describes the motion of each body in terms of its mass, position, and the positions of all other bodies.

  # Step 2: Identify the first integrals of motion
  First integrals of motion are quantities that remain constant over time, regardless of the motion of the system. In an N-body system, the first integrals of motion include the total energy, the total momentum, and the angular momentum.

  # Step 3: Derive the first integral of motion for the total momentum
  The total momentum is the sum of the momenta of all bodies in the system. The momentum of each body is given by $\mathbf{p}_{i}=m_{i}\mathbf{\dot{r}}_{i}$. To derive the first integral of motion for the total momentum, we take the time derivative of the total momentum:

  We substitute the given dynamical equation for each body into the expression for the time derivative of the total momentum:

  We simplify the expression by rearranging the terms:

  # Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equations
  We are given two equations for the velocities at aphelion (v_A) and perihelion (v_P) of a celestial body in elliptical motion. These equations involve the gravitational constant (μ), semi-major axis (a), and eccentricity (e) of the elliptical orbit.

  # Step 2: Recall the equation for the conservation of angular momentum
  The conservation of angular momentum is given by L = r x (m * v), where L is the angular momentum, r is the position vector, m is the mass of the celestial body, and v is its velocity.

  # Step 3: Express the angular momentum in terms of the semi-major axis and eccentricity
  We know that for an elliptical orbit, the angular momentum is constant and can be expressed as L = √(μ * a * (1 - e^2)).

  # Step 4: Use the conservation of energy to relate the velocities at aphelion and perihelion
  The total energy of the celestial body is given by E = -μ / (2 * a), which is a constant for a closed orbit.

  # Step 5: Express the velocities at aphelion and perihelion in terms of the semi-major axis and eccentricity
  At aphelion, the velocity is given by v_A = √(2 * μ / r_A - μ / a), where r_A is the distance from the celestial body to the central body at aphelion.
  At perihelion, the velocity is given by v_P = √(2 * μ / r_P - μ / a), where r_P is the distance from the celestial body to the central body at perihelion.

  # Step 6: Use the equation of an ellipse to relate the distances at aphelion and perihelion to the semi-major axis and eccentricity
  The equation of an ellipse is given by r = a * (1 - e^2) / (1 + e * cos(θ)), where θ is the true anomaly.
  At aphelion, θ = 0, and r_A = a * (1 - e) / (1 + e).
  At perihelion, θ = π, and r_P = a * (1 - e) / (1 - e).

  # Step 7: Substitute the expressions for r_A and r_P into the equations for v_A and v_P
  v_A = √(2 * μ / (a * (1 - e) / (1 + e)) - μ / a)
  v_P = √(2 * μ / (a * (1 - e) / (1 - e)) - μ / a)

Multiplying the volume by the average density of the planet, $\rho$, we get the mass of the planet, $M = \rho V = \rho \pi R^2 h$.

  2. Next, we can use Newton's law of universal gravitation to find the gravitational force between the planet and the satellite. The gravitational force is given by $F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $r$ is the distance between the centers of the planet and the satellite.

  4. Equating the gravitational force to the centripetal force, we can solve for the velocity of the satellite.

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

  ""solution"": 
  Step 1: To find the density value of the white dwarf, we first need to determine the mass of the star. Since the star is composed of nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, the total number of nuclei in the star is $M_{nuclei} = \frac{M}{A}$. The total number of electrons in the star is $N_e = Z \times M_{nuclei} = Z \times \frac{M}{A}$.

  Step 2: The number density of electrons in the star can be found by dividing the total number of electrons by the volume of the star. The volume of a sphere (such as the star) is given by $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$, where $R$ is the radius of the star. The mass of the star is $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho$, where $\rho$ is the density of the star. Therefore, the radius of the star can be expressed in terms of its mass and density as $R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$. The volume of the star can then be expressed as $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3}{4\pi}\right)^{2/3} \frac{M^{2/3}}{\rho^{1/3}}$.

The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$.

  ""solution"": 
  To solve this problem, we need to consider the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the proton. We can use the following steps:

  1. The gravitational potential energy between the electron and the proton is given by:
  \[ U_{g} = -\frac{Gm_{p}m_{e}}{r} \]
  However, since we are assuming that the Coulombic attraction is dominant and the gravitational potential energy is negligible, we will ignore this term.

  2. The Coulombic potential energy between the electron and the proton is given by:
  \[ U_{c} = -\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \]
  where $e$ is the electric charge quantity and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the electric constant.

  3. The total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy:
  \[ E = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \]
  Since we are assuming that $m_{p} \gg m_{e}$, the electron's motion is non-relativistic, and we can use the classical expression for kinetic energy.

  4. To find the orbital momentum, we need to consider the angular momentum of the electron. The angular momentum of a particle is given by:
  \[ L = r \times mv \]
  Since the electron is orbiting the proton at a radius $r$, we can use the following expression for the orbital momentum:
  \[ L = mvr \]

  \[ E = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{L}{mr}\right)^{2} - \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \]
  Simplifying this expression, we get:

  \[ E = \frac{m^{2}v^{2}r^{2}}{2mr^{2}} - \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} \]
  Simplifying this expression, we get:

  ""solution"": 
  ""To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

  (i) Determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision.

  The meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, so it has a constant speed v_m. We can use the conservation of energy to find this speed.

  The initial potential energy of the meteorite is 0 (at infinity), and its kinetic energy is 0 (since it's not moving in the radial direction). The final potential energy is -G M m_1 / R (since it's at distance R from the Earth), and its kinetic energy is (1/2) m_1 v_m^2.

  Using the conservation of energy, we get:

  0 = -G M m_1 / R + (1/2) m_1 v_m^2

  Solving for v_m, we get:

  v_m = sqrt(2 G M / R)

  (ii) Determine the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate.

  The conglomerate has a minimum speed when it is at its closest point to the Earth (R/2), and a maximum speed when it is at its farthest point (R).

  We can use the conservation of energy again to find these speeds.

  The initial potential energy of the conglomerate is -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R (since it's at distance R from the Earth), and its kinetic energy is (1/2) (m_1 + m_2) v_min^2.

  Using the conservation of energy, we get:

  -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R = (1/2) (m_1 + m_2) v_min^2

  Solving for v_min, we get:

  v_min = sqrt(2 G M (m_1 + m_2) / R)

  The maximum speed of the conglomerate is found similarly:

  -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R = (1/2) (m_1 + m_2) v_max^2

  Solving for v_max, we get:

  v_max = sqrt(2 G M (m_1 + m_2) / R)

  (iii) Determine the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

  The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is the same as the maximum distance of the space station from the center of the Earth, which is R.

  (iv) Determine the condition that m_1 and m_2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.

  For the conglomerate to move in a closed orbit that approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2, the total energy of the conglomerate must be negative.

  The total energy of the conglomerate is:

  E = -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R + (1/2) (m_1 + m_2) v^2

  For the conglomerate to have a negative total energy, we must have:

  -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R + (1/2) (m_1 + m_2) v^2 < 0

  Since v^2 >= 0, we must have:

  -G M (m_1 + m_2) / R < 0

  This is always true, since G M > 0 and R > 0.

  However, we also need to ensure that the conglomerate has a closed orbit. For this to be the case, the total angular momentum of the conglomerate must be conserved.

  The total angular momentum of the conglomerate is:

  L = m_1 r v_m + m_2 r v

  Since the conglomerate has a closed orbit, we must have:

  L = constant

  This implies that:

  m_1 r v_m + m_2 r v = constant

  Since v_m = sqrt(2 G M / R) and v = sqrt(2 G M (m_1 + m_2) / R), we get:

  m_1 r sqrt(2 G M / R) + m_2 r sqrt(2 G M (m_1 + m_2) / R) = constant

  Simplifying, we get:

  m_1 sqrt(2 G M / R) + m_2 sqrt(2 G M (m_1 + m_2) / R) = constant

  For this to be true, we must have:

  m_1 / m_2 = constant

  This is the condition that m_1 and m_2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.""

  We can then substitute the expression for F into the formula for the apparent magnitude:
  m = -2.5 log10(L / (4 \* π \* d²)) + C

We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

  By simplifying the equation of motion, we can obtain an expression for the orbital radius r in terms of the masses and the velocity of the object.

  # Step 4: Derive Kepler's Second Law (Conservation of Angular Momentum)
  We can use the equation of motion to derive Kepler's second law, which states that the line connecting the object to the central mass sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

  # Step 5: Derive Kepler's Third Law
  By combining the equation of motion with the law of universal gravitation, we can derive Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period of the object to its distance from the central mass.

  # Step 6: Derive Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)
  We can use the equation of motion to derive Kepler's first law, which states that the orbit of the object is an ellipse with the central mass at one of its foci.

  1. The orbit of an object is an ellipse with the central mass at one of its foci.
  2. The line connecting the object to the central mass sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude:

  # Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what needs to be derived.
  The problem asks us to derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for two cases: (I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

  # Step 2: Recall the expression for the line-of-sight velocity in the two cases.
  For case (I), the line-of-sight velocity is given by $V_{\mathrm{r}} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$. For case (II), we need to use the first order approximation for the line-of-sight velocity, which is $V_{\mathrm{r}} = AD\sin2l$.

  # Step 3: Recall the expression for the angular velocity in the two cases.
  For case (I), we need to use the expression for the angular velocity in terms of the rotational velocity, which is $\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$. For case (II), we need to use the first order approximation for the angular velocity, which can be derived from the expression for the line-of-sight velocity.

  # Step 4: Derive the expression for the angular velocity in case (II).
  From the expression for the line-of-sight velocity in case (II), we have $V_{\mathrm{r}} = AD\sin2l$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $l$, we get $\frac{dV_{\mathrm{r}}}{dl} = 2AD\cos2l$. Using the expression for the angular velocity, we have $\Omega = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R}$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $R$, we get $\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R^2}$. Substituting the expression for $V_{\mathrm{r}}$, we get $\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{AD\sin2l}{R^2}$.

  # Step 5: Derive the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for case (II).
  At the location of the Sun, $R = R_{0}$. Substituting this value into the expression for the angular velocity, we get $\Omega = \frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R_{0}} = \frac{AD\sin2l}{R_{0}}$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $R$, we get $\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{AD\sin2l}{R_{0}^2}$. The radial gradient of the rotational velocity is given by $\frac{dV}{dR} = R\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$. Substituting the expression for $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$, we get $\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{AD\sin2l}{R_{0}}$.

  # Step 6: Derive the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for case (I).
  For case (I), we need to use the expression for the angular velocity in terms of the rotational velocity, which is $\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $R$, we get $\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{V}{R^2}$. The radial gradient of the rotational velocity is given by $\frac{dV}{dR} = R\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$. Substituting the expression for $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$, we get $\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{V}{R}$.

  # Step 7: Evaluate the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for case (I).
  At the location of the Sun, $R = R_{0}$. Substituting this value into the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity, we get $\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{V}{R_{0}}$.

  # Step 8: Evaluate the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for case (II).
  At the location of the Sun, $R = R_{0}$. Substituting this value into the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity, we get $\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{AD\sin2l}{R_{0}}$. Since the value of $l$ at the location of the Sun is not given, we cannot evaluate the radial gradient of the rotational velocity for case (II).

  ""solution"": 
  Step 1: Understand the given problem and identify the key elements.
  - The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is to be determined.
  - A large mirror is placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System.
  - A laser beam is directed towards the mirror for a time $T$ and returns to the Earth.
  - The separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, given by the law $S = se^{H_{0}t}$.

  Step 2: Identify the relationship between the time $T$ and the distance $S$.
  - The laser beam travels to the mirror and returns, so the total distance traveled is $2D$.
  - Since the separation $S$ increases due to the expansion of the universe, the distance $D$ traveled by the laser beam is equal to $S$.

  Step 3: Express $S$ in terms of $H_0$, $t$, and $s$ using the given law.
  - $S = se^{H_{0}t}$

  Step 4: Use the approximation $e^x \approx 1 + x$ for $x \ll 1$ to simplify the expression for $S$.
  - Since $x = H_{0}t \ll 1$, we can write $e^{H_{0}t} \approx 1 + H_{0}t$.
  - Therefore, $S \approx s(1 + H_{0}t)$

  Step 5: Express $t$ in terms of $T$.
  - The time $T$ is the time taken by the laser beam to travel to the mirror and return.
  - Therefore, $t = \frac{T}{2}$

  Step 6: Substitute $t = \frac{T}{2}$ into the expression for $S$.
  - $S \approx s(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})$

  Step 7: Equate $S$ to $D$ and solve for $H_0$.
  - $D \approx s(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})$
  - Rearranging the equation to solve for $H_0$:
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{2(D - s)}{sT}$

  Step 8: Simplify the expression for $H_0$.
  - Since $D \approx S$, we can write $D \approx s(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})$.
  - Therefore, $H_0 \approx \frac{2(D - s)}{sT}$

  Step 9: Write the final expression for $H_0$ in terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$.
  - Since $S = se^{H_{0}t}$ and $t = \frac{T}{2}$, we can write $e^{H_{0}t} \approx 1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2}$.
  - Therefore, $H_0 \approx \frac{2(D - s)}{sT}$.

  Step 10: Express $H_0$ in terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$.
  - Since $D \approx S$, we can write $D \approx s(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})$.
  - Rearranging the equation to solve for $H_0$:
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{2(D - s)}{sT}$

  Step 11: Simplify the expression for $H_0$.
  - Since $D \approx S$, we can write $D \approx s(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})$.
  - Therefore, $H_0 \approx \frac{2(D - s)}{sT}$.

  Step 12: Write the final expression for $H_0$ in terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$.
  - Since the speed of light is $c$, we can write $c = \frac{2D}{T}$.
  - Rearranging the equation to solve for $D$:
  - $D = \frac{cT}{2}$.

  Step 13: Substitute $D = \frac{cT}{2}$ into the expression for $H_0$.
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{2(\frac{cT}{2} - s)}{sT}$

  Step 14: Simplify the expression for $H_0$.
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{cT}{sT} - \frac{2s}{sT}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{s} - \frac{2}{T}$

  Step 15: Since $H_0$ is a constant, we can neglect the term $\frac{2}{T}$.
  - Therefore, $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{s}$.

  However, the question does not specify the initial separation $s$. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of $H_0$.

  However, we can express $H_0$ in terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$.
  - Since $D \approx \frac{cT}{2}$, we can write $s \approx \frac{D}{1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2}}$.
  - Substituting $s \approx \frac{D}{1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2}}$ into the expression for $H_0$:
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{s} \approx \frac{c}{\frac{D}{1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2}}}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c(1 + H_{0}\frac{T}{2})}{D}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c + cH_{0}\frac{T}{2}}{D}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D} + \frac{cH_{0}\frac{T}{2}}{D}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D} + H_0 \frac{cT}{2D}$
  - $H_0 - H_0 \frac{cT}{2D} \approx \frac{c}{D}$
  - $H_0(1 - \frac{cT}{2D}) \approx \frac{c}{D}$
  - $H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D(1 - \frac{cT}{2D})}$

  ""To find the expression for the total gravitational wave luminosity $L_{GW}$, we'll use the given dimensionless constant $\frac{2}{5}$ and the physical constants $G$ and $c$. Since $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power, we can assume that the expression for $L_{GW}$ will be of the form $L_{GW} = k \frac{GM^2}{c^p R^q}$, where $k$ is the dimensionless constant $\frac{2}{5}$, and $p$ and $q$ are the powers to which $c$ and $R$ are raised, respectively.

To find the powers $p$ and $q$, we'll use dimensional analysis. The dimensions of the terms in the expression are:
- $k$: dimensionless
- $G$: $\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}$
- $M$: $m$
- $c$: $\frac{m}{s}$
- $R$: $m$

Since the dimensions of the expression must be equal to the dimensions of power, we can set up the following equation:
$\frac{m^3}{kg s^2} \cdot m^2 \cdot \frac{m}{s}^{-p} \cdot m^{-q} = \frac{m^2}{s^2}$

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$m^{3+2-p-q} \cdot s^{-2-p} \cdot kg^{-1} = m^2 \cdot s^{-2}$

Equating the exponents of the same variables, we get:
$3+2-p-q = 2$
$-2-p = -2$
$-1 = -1$

Solving the first equation, we get:
$-p-q = -1$

Substituting $p = -2$ from the second equation, we get:
$-(-2) - q = -1$
$2 - q = -1$
$-q = -3$
$q = 3$

Now that we have the powers $p$ and $q$, we can substitute them into the expression for $L_{GW}$:
$L_{GW} = k \frac{GM^2}{c^p R^q} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{GM^2}{c^2 R^3}$

  ""solution"": 
  Step 1: We are given the expression for the luminosity of gravitational waves, L_{GW}, as a function of the mass of the neutron stars (M), the radius of the orbit (R), and the speed of light (c). We need to find the rate of change of the radius (R) with respect to time (t).

  Step 2: The luminosity of gravitational waves is related to the rate of change of the radius of the orbit. We can start by taking the time derivative of the expression for L_{GW}.

  Step 3: Using the chain rule, we can rewrite the time derivative of L_{GW} as:
  \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial L_{GW}}{\partial R} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}

  Step 4: We can now substitute the expression for L_{GW} and calculate the partial derivative with respect to R:

  \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}

  Step 8: We can now substitute the expression for L_{GW} into the equation for the time derivative of the energy:
  \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}

  Step 9: Equating the two expressions for the time derivative of the energy, we get:
