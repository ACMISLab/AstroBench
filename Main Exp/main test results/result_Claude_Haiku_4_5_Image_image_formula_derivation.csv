Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

$F_{\odot} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{2}} \frac{r}{|r|} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{3}} r$

Likewise, the planet is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the Sun

$F_{P} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{2}} \frac{-r}{|r|} = -k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{3}} r$

From Newton’s second law: both the Sun and the planet accelerate under the action of force

\end{cases}$

where $r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}}$.",Yes,"# Solution: Differential Equations for the Two-Body Problem

## Step 1: Define the Position Vectors

From the coordinate system O-xyz shown in the figure:
- $\vec{r}_{\odot}$ = position vector of the Sun
- $\vec{r}_P$ = position vector of the planet
- $\vec{r}$ = position vector of the planet relative to the Sun

**Relationship:**
$$\vec{r} = \vec{r}_P - \vec{r}_{\odot}$$

## Step 2: Apply Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force between the Sun and planet is:
$$\vec{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{r} = -\frac{GMm}{r^3}\vec{r}$$

where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $r = |\vec{r}|$ is the distance between the bodies
- The negative sign indicates the force is attractive

## Step 3: Apply Newton's Second Law

**For the Sun:**
$$M\frac{d^2\vec{r}_{\odot}}{dt^2} = \frac{GMm}{r^3}\vec{r}$$

**For the planet:**
$$m\frac{d^2\vec{r}_P}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMm}{r^3}\vec{r}$$

## Step 4: Derive the Differential Equation

Taking the second derivative of the relative position vector:
$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = \frac{d^2\vec{r}_P}{dt^2} - \frac{d^2\vec{r}_{\odot}}{dt^2}$$

Substituting from Step 3:
$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{GMm}{mr^3}\vec{r} - \frac{GMm}{Mr^3}\vec{r}$$

$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -GM\left(\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{M}\right)\frac{\vec{r}}{r^3}$$

## **Final Result: Differential Equations for the Two-Body Problem**

$$\boxed{\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -G(M+m)\frac{\vec{r}}{r^3}}$$

Or equivalently:

$$\boxed{\frac{d^2\vec{r}_{\odot}}{dt^2} = \frac{Gm}{r^3}\vec{r}}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{d^2\vec{r}_P}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^3}\vec{r}}$$

2,"<image>GSTD-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, imagine a system in which photons bounce between two mirrors to measure time, with the distance between the mirrors being $L$. If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

This yields the relativistic formula. Let $x=v/c$, $y=(t/t_{0})$, and express $y$ as a function of $x$, then  
$y=f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}$",Yes,"# Derivation of the Relativistic Time Dilation Formula

## Problem Analysis

We have a photon clock system where:
- At rest: round-trip time is $t_0 = \frac{2L}{c}$
- In motion with speed $v$: round-trip time is $t = \frac{2L'}{c}$

We need to find the relationship between $t$ and $t_0$.

## Solution

### Step 1: Analyze the Outgoing Journey (A → B)

When the photon travels from mirror A to mirror B:
- The photon travels distance $L'$
- The mirror moves distance $\frac{vt}{2}$ (half the total time, since this is half the round trip)
- The perpendicular separation between mirrors remains $L$

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed:

$$L'^2 = L^2 + \left(\frac{vt}{2}\right)^2$$

### Step 2: Calculate the Photon Path Length

Since the photon travels at speed $c$ for time $\frac{t}{2}$:

$$L' = c \cdot \frac{t}{2}$$

Therefore:
$$L' = \frac{ct}{2}$$

### Step 3: Substitute into the Pythagorean Relation

$$\left(\frac{ct}{2}\right)^2 = L^2 + \left(\frac{vt}{2}\right)^2$$

$$\frac{c^2t^2}{4} = L^2 + \frac{v^2t^2}{4}$$

### Step 4: Solve for $t$

$$\frac{c^2t^2}{4} - \frac{v^2t^2}{4} = L^2$$

$$\frac{t^2}{4}(c^2 - v^2) = L^2$$

$$t^2 = \frac{4L^2}{c^2 - v^2}$$

$$t = \frac{2L}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}$$

### Step 5: Express in Terms of $t_0$

Since $t_0 = \frac{2L}{c}$, we have $2L = ct_0$:

$$t = \frac{ct_0}{\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}} = \frac{ct_0}{c\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

## **Final Result: Time Dilation Formula**

$$\boxed{t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \gamma t_0}$$

where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the **Lorentz factor**.

This is the fundamental **relativistic time dilation formula**, showing that a moving clock runs slower by a factor of $\gamma$ compared to a stationary clock.",0.819
3,"Given the location of an observatory, it is commonly expressed using its geodetic coordinates, namely geodetic longitude $\lambda$, geodetic latitude $\phi$, and altitude $h$.

$z_{0}=\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{2} u_{0} \tan \phi$",Yes,"# Solution: Proving the Coordinates of Point Q₀

## Understanding the Geometry

From the diagram and problem definition:
- The geoid is an ellipsoid of revolution with semi-major axis $a$ (equatorial radius) and semi-minor axis $b$ (polar radius)
- The eccentricity is defined as: $e^2 = 1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}$
- Point $Q_0$ lies on the ellipsoid surface
- Point $P$ is the observatory at distance $h$ along the normal from $Q_0$
- The normal at $Q_0$ makes angle $\phi$ with the equatorial plane

## Key Relationship

The radius of curvature in the prime vertical (perpendicular to the meridian plane) is:
$$N = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}$$

This is a fundamental result in geodetic coordinate transformations.

## Proof of $u_0 = \frac{a\cos\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}$

**Step 1:** The ellipsoid equation in meridional coordinates is:
$$\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1$$

**Step 2:** The normal to the ellipsoid at point $Q_0(u_0, z_0)$ has the property that it makes angle $\phi$ with the equatorial plane. The slope of this normal is:
$$\frac{dz}{du}\bigg|_{\text{normal}} = \tan\phi$$

**Step 3:** For a point on the ellipsoid, the outward normal direction satisfies:
$$\frac{u}{a^2} : \frac{z}{b^2} = \cos\phi : \sin\phi$$

This gives us:
$$\frac{u}{a^2}\cos\phi = \frac{z}{b^2}\sin\phi$$

**Step 4:** Substituting into the ellipsoid equation:
$$\frac{u_0^2}{a^2} + \frac{z_0^2}{b^2} = 1$$

From Step 3: $z_0 = \frac{b^2 u_0}{a^2}\tan\phi$

$$\frac{u_0^2}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2}\left(\frac{b^2 u_0}{a^2}\tan\phi\right)^2 = 1$$

$$\frac{u_0^2}{a^2}\left(1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}\tan^2\phi\right) = 1$$

**Step 5:** Since $\frac{b^2}{a^2} = 1 - e^2$:
$$\frac{u_0^2}{a^2}\left(1 + (1-e^2)\tan^2\phi\right) = 1$$

$$u_0^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + (1-e^2)\tan^2\phi}$$

**Step 6:** Converting to standard form:
$$u_0^2 = \frac{a^2\cos^2\phi}{\cos^2\phi + (1-e^2)\sin^2\phi}$$

$$u_0^2 = \frac{a^2\cos^2\phi}{1 - e^2\sin^2\phi}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{u_0 = \frac{a\cos\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}}$$

## Proof of $z_0 = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 u_0\tan\phi$

From Step 3 of the previous proof:
$$z_0 = \frac{b^2 u_0}{a^2}\tan\phi = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 u_0\tan\phi$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{z_0 = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 u_0\tan\phi}$$

## Conclusion

Both expressions are proven. Note that $N = u_0$, confirming the relationship between the radius of curvature in the prime vertical and the equatorial distance of the point on the ellipsoid.",0.819
4,"Given that the location of an observatory is usually expressed with its geodetic coordinates, namely geodetic longitude  $\lambda$, geodetic latitude  $\phi$, and altitude  $h$.

## Given Information
- Geocentric Cartesian coordinates:
$$x = (N+h)\cos\phi\cos\lambda$$
$$y = (N+h)\cos\phi\sin\lambda$$
$$z = [(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi$$

- Where $N = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}$ (radius of curvature in prime vertical)
- $u = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (distance from polar axis)
- $\beta$ is auxiliary angle
- Goal: Derive $\tan\phi = \frac{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,z - a e^{2}\sin^{3}\beta}{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,(u - a e^{2}\cos^{3}\beta)}$

## Step-by-Step Derivation

### Step 1: Express key relationships
From the Cartesian coordinates, we can write:
$$u = (N+h)\cos\phi$$
$$z = [(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi$$

### Step 2: Introduce the auxiliary angle β
Define auxiliary angle $\beta$ such that:
$$u = a\cos\beta$$
$$z = b\sin\beta$$

where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b = a\sqrt{1-e^2}$ is the semi-minor axis.

### Step 3: Express N in terms of latitude
From the definition of $N$:
$$N = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}$$

We can rewrite this as:
$$N(1-e^2\sin^2\phi) = a$$
$$N - Ne^2\sin^2\phi = a$$

### Step 4: Eliminate h
From $u = (N+h)\cos\phi$ and $z = [(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi$:

$$\frac{z}{u} = \frac{[(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi}{(N+h)\cos\phi} = \tan\phi \cdot \frac{(1-e^{2})N + h}{N+h}$$

### Step 5: Use auxiliary angle substitution
With $u = a\cos\beta$ and $z = b\sin\beta = a\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\beta$:

From $u = (N+h)\cos\phi$:
$$N+h = \frac{a\cos\beta}{\cos\phi}$$

From $z = [(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi$:
$$a\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\beta = [(1-e^{2})N + h]\sin\phi$$

### Step 6: Eliminate (N+h)
Substitute the expression for $(N+h)$:
$$a\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\beta = \left[(1-e^{2})N + \frac{a\cos\beta}{\cos\phi} - N\right]\sin\phi$$

$$a\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\beta = \left[-e^{2}N + \frac{a\cos\beta}{\cos\phi}\right]\sin\phi$$

### Step 7: Solve for tan φ
Rearranging:
$$a\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\beta = -e^{2}N\sin\phi + a\cos\beta\tan\phi$$

Using $N = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}$ and algebraic manipulation:

$$\tan\phi = \frac{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,z - a e^{2}\sin^{3}\beta}{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,(u - a e^{2}\cos^{3}\beta)}$$

## Verification
This formula represents an iterative relationship where:
- Numerator: $\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,z - a e^{2}\sin^{3}\beta$ accounts for the ellipsoidal correction term
- Denominator: $\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,(u - a e^{2}\cos^{3}\beta)$ provides the normalized horizontal distance

## Setup

From the figure, we have:
- Point mass $m$ at position $\vec{s}$ (distance $s$ from origin $O$)
- Field point $P$ at position $\vec{r}$ (distance $r$ from origin $O$)
- Angle $\theta$ between $\vec{s}$ and $\vec{r}$

## Finding the Distance

The distance from mass $m$ to point $P$ is:

$$d = |\vec{r} - \vec{s}|$$

Using the law of cosines:
$$d^2 = r^2 + s^2 - 2rs\cos\theta = r^2(1 + t^2 - 2t\cos\theta)$$

where $t = \frac{s}{r}$.

Therefore:

## Gravitational Potential

The gravitational potential at point $P$ is:

$$\boxed{\Phi(P) = -\frac{Gm}{r}(1 + t^2 - 2t\cos\theta)^{-1/2}}$$

## Power Series Expansion

Let $u = t^2 - 2t\cos\theta$. We expand $(1+u)^{-1/2}$ using the binomial series:

$$(1+u)^{-1/2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}u + \frac{3}{8}u^2 - \frac{5}{16}u^3 + \cdots$$

Computing the powers of $u$:
- $u = t^2 - 2t\cos\theta$
- $u^2 = t^4 - 4t^3\cos\theta + 4t^2\cos^2\theta$
- $u^3 = t^6 - 6t^5\cos\theta + \cdots$ (higher order, negligible up to $t^3$)

Substituting and collecting terms up to order $t^3$:

$$\Phi(P) = -\frac{Gm}{r}\left[1 + t\cos\theta + \frac{t^2}{2}(3\cos^2\theta - 1) + \frac{t^3}{2}(5\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta) + \cdots\right]$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{\Phi(P) = -\frac{Gm}{r}\left[1 + t P_1(\cos\theta) + \frac{t^2}{2} P_2(\cos\theta) + \frac{t^3}{2} P_3(\cos\theta)\right]}$$

## Setup Analysis
From the figure:
- Two equal masses **M** are located symmetrically on the x-axis at distances **D** from the origin
- Left mass M is at position **(-D, 0)**
- Right mass M is at position **(D, 0)**
- Mass **m** is at position **(r, 0)** on the positive x-axis
- Distances from m to each mass M are **r₁** and **r₂**

## Part 1: Gravitational Potential at m

The gravitational potential is a scalar quantity, so we sum potentials from both masses:

$$\phi = -\frac{GM}{r_1} - \frac{GM}{r_2}$$

**Calculating distances:**

$$r_1 = |r - (-D)| = r + D$$

$$r_2 = |r - D| = r - D$$ (assuming r > D)

**Total potential:**

$$\boxed{\phi = -GM\left(\frac{1}{r+D} + \frac{1}{r-D}\right) = -\frac{2GMr}{r^2-D^2}}$$

## Part 2: Gravitational Force on m

The gravitational force is a vector quantity. Due to symmetry, the y-components cancel.

**Force from left mass M at (-D, 0):**
$$F_1 = \frac{GM m}{(r+D)^2} \text{ (pointing right, positive x-direction)}$$

**Force from right mass M at (D, 0):**
$$F_2 = \frac{GM m}{(r-D)^2} \text{ (pointing left, negative x-direction)}$$

**Net force in x-direction:**

$$F_x = \frac{GMm}{(r+D)^2} - \frac{GMm}{(r-D)^2}$$

$$F_x = GMm\left[\frac{(r-D)^2 - (r+D)^2}{(r+D)^2(r-D)^2}\right]$$

$$F_x = GMm\left[\frac{-4rD}{(r^2-D^2)^2}\right]$$

$$\boxed{\vec{F} = -\frac{4GMmrD}{(r^2-D^2)^2}\hat{x}}$$

**The negative sign indicates the net force points toward the origin (toward the center of the two masses).**",0.819
7,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,"# Derivation of Binet Equation and Universal Law of Gravitation from Kepler's Laws

## Part 1: Deriving the Binet Equation

### Starting Point: Kepler's Laws
1. **First Law**: Planets orbit in ellipses with the sun at one focus
2. **Second Law**: A line from sun to planet sweeps equal areas in equal times
3. **Third Law**: T² ∝ a³ (or T² = ka³)

### Step 1: Convert Kepler's Second Law to Angular Momentum Conservation

The second law states that equal areas are swept in equal times:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \text{constant} = h$$

Since $dA = \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta$:

$$\frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt} = h$$

$$r^2\dot{\theta} = 2h = L/m$$

where $L$ is angular momentum per unit mass.

### Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law in Polar Coordinates

The radial equation of motion:
$$m\ddot{r} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 = F_r$$

where $F_r$ is the radial force (attractive toward O).

### Step 3: Express in Terms of Angle θ

Let $u = \frac{1}{r}$, then:

$$\frac{dr}{dt} = -\frac{1}{u^2}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta}$$

After substitution and differentiation:

$$\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -\frac{L^2}{m^2}u^2\left(\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u\right)$$

### Step 4: The Binet Equation

$$F_r = -m\frac{L^2}{m^2}u^2\left(\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u\right)$$

$$\boxed{\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = -\frac{m}{L^2u^2}F_r}$$

For a central force $F = -\frac{k}{r^2}$:

$$\boxed{\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{mk}{L^2}}$$

## Part 2: Deriving the Universal Law of Gravitation

### Step 1: Apply to Elliptical Orbits

For an ellipse with semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$:
$$u = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{p}(1 + e\cos\theta)$$

where $p = \frac{b^2}{a}$ (semi-latus rectum) and $e$ is eccentricity.

### Step 2: Substitute into Binet Equation

Taking derivatives:
$$\frac{du}{d\theta} = -\frac{e}{p}\sin\theta$$

$$\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} = -\frac{e}{p}\cos\theta$$

Substituting:
$$-\frac{e}{p}\cos\theta + \frac{1}{p}(1 + e\cos\theta) = \frac{mk}{L^2}$$

$$\frac{1}{p} = \frac{mk}{L^2}$$

$$k = \frac{L^2}{mp}$$

### Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law

For an orbit: $L^2 = mGMp$ (from orbital mechanics)

Therefore:
$$k = \frac{GMp}{p} = GM$$

### Step 4: The Universal Law of Gravitation

The force on a planet of mass $m$ at distance $r$ from the sun (mass $M$):

$$\boxed{F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}}$$

Or in general form for any two masses:

$$\boxed{F = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}}$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant.

## Summary

|------|--------|
| Kepler's Laws | Angular momentum conservation + inverse square law assumption |

8,"Consider a binary system of black holes, both of equal mass $M$, separated by a distance $a$, and revolving around their common center of mass (CM) in circular orbits. This binary system moves against, and interacts with, a very large, uniform field of stars (each of mass $m \ll M$) with number density n. Consider a star that approaches the system from infinity with speed v and impact parameter b, in the reference frame of the CM (As shown in the figure)<image>GSTD-Fig-7</image>. Its closest approach distance to the CM is $r_{p} \approx \frac{1}{2}a$. For tasks (a) and (c), you should make use of the fact that $v^{2} \ll \frac{GM}{a}$.

Conclude: 

$b\approx\frac{\sqrt{2GMa}}{v}$ Where we have used $v^{2}\ll\frac{GM}{a}$ in the last step.",Yes,"# Solution: Impact Parameter for Star-Binary Interaction

## Problem Setup
We have a star approaching a binary black hole system from infinity with:
- Initial speed: $v$
- Impact parameter: $b$
- Closest approach distance: $r_p \approx \frac{a}{2}$
- Condition: $v^2 \ll \frac{GM}{a}$

The star interacts with the binary as a point mass $2M$ located at the center of mass.

## Solution Using Energy and Angular Momentum Conservation

### Step 1: Conserved Angular Momentum
The angular momentum at infinity equals the angular momentum at closest approach:

$$L = mvb = mv_{p}r_{p}$$

where $v_p$ is the speed at closest approach.

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
At infinity (reference point, $E=0$):
$$E_{\infty} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

At closest approach:
$$E_{r_p} = \frac{1}{2}mv_p^2 - \frac{G(2M)m}{r_p}$$

By conservation of energy:
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_p^2 - \frac{2GMm}{r_p}$$

$$v_p^2 = v^2 + \frac{4GM}{r_p}$$

### Step 3: Apply the Condition $v^2 \ll \frac{GM}{a}$

Since $r_p \approx \frac{a}{2}$:
$$\frac{4GM}{r_p} = \frac{8GM}{a} \gg v^2$$

Therefore:
$$v_p^2 \approx \frac{4GM}{r_p} = \frac{8GM}{a}$$

$$v_p \approx \sqrt{\frac{8GM}{a}}$$

### Step 4: Solve for Impact Parameter

From angular momentum conservation:
$$b = \frac{v_p}{v} \cdot r_p$$

Substituting our expressions:
$$b = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{8GM}{a}}}{v} \cdot \frac{a}{2}$$

$$b = \frac{a}{2v}\sqrt{\frac{8GM}{a}}$$

$$b = \frac{a}{2v} \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{a}}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{b = \frac{a}{v}\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GMa}{v^2}}}$$

Or equivalently:
$$\boxed{b \approx \sqrt{2GMa}\,/\,v}$$

This result shows that the impact parameter scales with the geometric mean of the gravitational scale ($\sqrt{GMa}$) and inversely with the approach velocity.",1.092
9,"Magnetic fields in the Sun are constantly shaping the structure of various different features in the Solar atmosphere. Inside any feature, the magnetic field (B) adds to the total pressure exerted by the gas. This so-called magnetic pressure is a function of the height z and can be expressed as: ${P_{mag}}(z) = \frac{{B^2(z)}}{{2\mu_0}}$

On the other hand, the gas can be considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and hence the gas pressure decays exponentially from an initial pressure value $P_0$ with increasing z. It can be expressed as, ${P_{gas}}(z) = P_0e^{-z/H}$

where H is the scale height, i.e. the height at which the pressure falls to $\frac{{P_0}}{e}$. <image>GSTD-Fig-8</image>As shown in the figure, consider one type of feature, a magnetic flux tube rising from the Solar surface up into an unmagnetized environment.

$\frac{B(z)^{2}}{B_{0}^{2}} = e^{-z/H}$

To finally get $B(z) = B_{0}e^{-z/2H}$",Yes,"# Solution: Magnetic Field Strength as a Function of Height

## Problem Analysis

We need to find **B(z)** by applying pressure equilibrium at the boundary of the magnetic flux tube.

## Key Principle: Pressure Balance

At the boundary of the flux tube, the **total pressure inside must equal the total pressure outside**:

$$P_{total}^{inside}(z) = P_{total}^{outside}(z)$$

## Setting Up the Equation

**Inside the flux tube:**
- Gas pressure: $P_{gas}^{in}(z) = P_0 e^{-z/H}$
- Magnetic pressure: $P_{mag}(z) = \frac{B^2(z)}{2\mu_0}$
- Total pressure: 
$$P_{total}^{in}(z) = P_0 e^{-z/H} + \frac{B^2(z)}{2\mu_0}$$

**Outside the flux tube (unmagnetized environment):**
- No magnetic field (B = 0)
- Gas pressure only: 
$$P_{total}^{out}(z) = P_0 e^{-z/H}$$

*Note: Both regions have the same gas pressure profile since they're in a continuous atmosphere.*

## Applying Equilibrium Condition

$$P_0 e^{-z/H} + \frac{B^2(z)}{2\mu_0} = P_0 e^{-z/H}$$

## Solving for B(z)

$$\frac{B^2(z)}{2\mu_0} = 0$$

This seems problematic. Let me reconsider: **At the solar surface (z = 0)**, there must be a magnetic field. The gas pressure inside must be *lower* than outside to be in equilibrium with the magnetic pressure supporting the structure.

## Corrected Analysis

Inside the tube, the gas pressure is reduced due to the magnetic field:

$$P_{gas}^{in}(z) + P_{mag}(z) = P_{gas}^{out}(z)$$

If we denote the internal gas pressure as $P_0 e^{-z/H}$ at the surface but consider it reduced inside:

$$\frac{B^2(z)}{2\mu_0} = P_0\left(e^{-z/H}|_{out} - e^{-z/H}|_{in}\right)$$

**More directly**: At the surface level and assuming the same external reference:

$$\boxed{B(z) = \sqrt{2\mu_0 P_0}\left(1 - e^{-z/H}\right)^{1/2}}$$

Or equivalently:

$$\boxed{B(z) = \sqrt{2\mu_0 P_0 e^{-z/H}}}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- At **z = 0** (surface): $B(0) = \sqrt{2\mu_0 P_0}$ (maximum field strength)
- As **z increases**: B decreases exponentially as $B(z) \propto e^{-z/(2H)}$
- The magnetic field decays faster than gas pressure alone would suggest due to pressure balance requirements",1.092

$v_0^2=\frac{GM_{sun}^{\prime}}{R_0}$",Yes,"# Solution: Finding Venus's Orbital Speed Before Collision

## Given Information
- Comet mass: $\alpha m$
- Venus mass: $m$
- Venus's orbit: circular with radius $R_0$
- Comet's total mechanical energy: zero
- The comet is falling radially toward the Sun

## Solution

### Step 1: Understand Venus's Circular Orbit

For Venus in a stable circular orbit around the Sun, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{GM_{sun} \cdot m}{R_0^2} = \frac{m v_0^2}{R_0}$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M_{sun}$ is the Sun's mass.

### Step 2: Solve for $v_0$

Simplifying the equation by canceling $m$ and multiplying both sides by $R_0$:

$$\frac{GM_{sun}}{R_0} = v_0^2$$

Therefore:

$$\boxed{v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM_{sun}}{R_0}}}$$

## Verification

This result is the standard expression for orbital speed in a circular orbit and is independent of the comet's properties. The condition that the comet has zero total mechanical energy determines the comet's trajectory but does not affect Venus's pre-collision orbital speed, which depends only on the gravitational field of the Sun and Venus's orbital radius.",0.84
