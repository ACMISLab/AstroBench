2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"### **Derivation of the Virial Theorem Using Newton’s Second Law**

---

#### **Step 1: Define the Virial**
The **virial** is defined as the sum over all particles in the system of the inner product of their position vector $ \mathbf{r}_i $ and the force acting on them $ \mathbf{F}_i $:

$$
V = \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

This quantity represents the ""work"" done by forces in the system over time.

---

#### **Step 2: Apply Newton’s Second Law**
Newton’s second law states that for each particle $ i $, the force acting on it is related to its acceleration:

$$
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i = m_i \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
$$

Substitute this into the expression for the virial:

$$
V = \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \left( m_i \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} \right)
$$

---

#### **Step 3: Time Derivative of $ \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i $**
Let $ \mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i $ be the momentum of particle $ i $. Consider the time derivative of $ \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i $:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i) = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{p}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i}{dt}
$$

Since $ \mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i $, we have $ \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{F}_i $ (from Newton’s second law), and $ \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{v}_i $. Substituting these:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i) = \mathbf{v}_i \cdot (m_i \mathbf{v}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = m_i v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Summing over all particles:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i \right) = \sum_{i} m_i v_i^2 + \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Note that $ \sum_{i} m_i v_i^2 = 2K $, where $ K $ is the total kinetic energy of the system. Thus:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i \right) = 2K + V
$$

Rearranging gives:

$$
V = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i \right) - 2K
$$

---

#### **Step 4: Time Averaging**
For a system in **long-term equilibrium** (e.g., a stable galaxy or star cluster), the time average of the derivative term vanishes:

$$
\left\langle \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i \right) \right\rangle = 0
$$

This is because the system does not undergo net changes over time (i.e., it is stationary on average). Therefore, the time-averaged virial becomes:

$$
\langle V \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
$$

This is the **virial theorem** in its most general form:

> The time-averaged virial equals **-2 times the time-averaged kinetic energy**.

---

#### **Step 5: Connection to Potential Energy (for Gravitational Systems)**
In the context of self-gravitating systems (like galaxies), the force $ \mathbf{F}_i $ arises from gravitational interactions. For such systems, it can be shown that the virial $ V $ is directly related to the **potential energy $ U $** of the system. Specifically:

$$
\langle V \rangle = \langle U \rangle
$$

Thus, combining with the virial theorem:

$$
\langle U \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
$$

or equivalently:

$$
2 \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

This is the **classical virial theorem** for gravitational systems, which is widely used in astrophysics to estimate the mass of galaxies.

---

### **Final Result: Virial Theorem Formula**

The **time-averaged virial theorem** derived from Newton’s second law is:

$$
\boxed{\langle \sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle}
$$

For gravitational systems (e.g., galaxies), this becomes:

$$
\boxed{2 \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0}
$$

This relationship is crucial for estimating the mass of galaxies using dynamical methods, as it connects observable quantities (e.g., velocity dispersions) to the total gravitational potential energy, which depends on the system's mass distribution.",0.546

At **perihelion**, the distance from the central body is:
$$
r_P = a(1 - e)
$$

Substitute $ r_P $ into the vis-viva equation:

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$$
\frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1 - e}{a(1 - e)} = \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{a(1 - e)} = \frac{1 + e}{a(1 - e)}
$$

Thus,

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \cdot \frac{1 + e}{a(1 - e)}
$$

Taking the square root gives:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

---

### Step 2: Aphelion Velocity ($ v_A $)

At **aphelion**, the distance from the central body is:
$$
r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

Substitute $ r_A $ into the vis-viva equation:

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$$
\frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1 + e}{a(1 + e)} = \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{a(1 + e)} = \frac{1 - e}{a(1 + e)}
$$

Thus,

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \cdot \frac{1 - e}{a(1 + e)}
$$

Taking the square root gives:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
$$

---

### Final Result

The velocities at aphelion and perihelion are:

$$
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
$$
$$
v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

These results are consistent with the conservation of angular momentum and energy, and directly derived from the vis-viva equation. The derivation confirms the given formulas for the velocities at the two key points in an elliptical orbit.

### Key Notes

- **Perihelion**: Closest approach to the central body, where $ r = a(1 - e) $.
- **Aphelion**: Farthest point from the central body, where $ r = a(1 + e) $.
- The vis-viva equation is a powerful tool for calculating orbital velocities at any point in the orbit, and its application here provides a concise proof of the required results.

$$
\boxed{
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

### **1. Gravitational Field Outside a Cylindrical Mass Distribution**

For an **infinitely long, uniform cylindrical mass** with radius $ R $, average density $ \rho $, and a satellite at a distance $ d > R $ (i.e., outside the cylinder), the gravitational field $ g $ at a radial distance $ d $ from the axis is derived using **Gauss's Law for Gravity**:

$$
\int \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enclosed}}
$$

- The **Gaussian surface** is a coaxial cylinder of radius $ d $, length $ L $.
- The **mass enclosed** within this surface is:
  $$
  M_{\text{enclosed}} = \rho \cdot \pi R^2 L
  $$
- The **flux through the curved surface** is:
  $$
  g \cdot (2\pi d L)
  $$
- Equating flux and enclosed mass:
  $$
  g \cdot 2\pi d L = 4\pi G \cdot \rho \pi R^2 L
  $$
- Solving for $ g $:
  $$
  g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
  $$

This shows that the **gravitational field strength decreases as $ 1/d $** for a cylindrical mass distribution — in contrast to the $ 1/r^2 $ behavior of a spherical mass.

---

### **2. Orbital Mechanics**

The **centripetal force** required for circular motion is provided by the gravitational force:

$$
F_{\text{grav}} = F_{\text{centripetal}}
$$

$$
m g = \frac{m v^2}{d}
$$

Substitute the expression for $ g $:

$$
m \cdot \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d} = \frac{m v^2}{d}
$$

Cancel $ m $ and $ d $ on both sides:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Thus, the **orbital speed** $ v $ is constant (independent of $ d $):

$$
v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}
$$

---

### **3. Relating Period $ P $ to Distance $ d $**

The orbital period $ P $ is related to the orbital speed $ v $ by:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

Substitute $ v $:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
$$

Squaring both sides gives the **final expression**:

$$
P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
$$

---

### **4. Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}}
$$

This equation expresses the **orbital period $ P $** of a satellite in terms of its **distance $ d $** from the center of the cylindrical planet, given the **average density $ \rho $** and **radius $ R $** of the planet. It reflects the unique behavior of gravitational fields in cylindrical symmetry, where the period increases linearly with the orbital radius.",0.637
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

### **Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)**

Spiral galaxies exhibit **circular rotation** due to the dominance of ordered orbital motion. The **rotational velocity** $ v $ at a radius $ R $ (the galaxy's radius) provides a direct measure of the enclosed mass within that radius.

#### **Key Principle: Centripetal Force Balance**
The gravitational force provides the centripetal acceleration for stars in circular orbits:
$$
\frac{GM_A}{R} = \frac{v^2}{R}
$$
Solving for the mass $ M_A $:
$$
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
$$

This formula assumes all mass is contained within the radius $ R $, consistent with the problem's description.

---

### **Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)**

Elliptical galaxies are characterized by **random stellar motions** (velocity dispersion), not ordered rotation. The **radial velocity dispersion** $ v $ (1D) is used in the **virial theorem** to estimate the mass of a self-gravitating system in equilibrium.

#### **Key Principle: Virial Theorem**
For a **spherical, uniform mass distribution** (as stated for Galaxy B), the virial theorem relates the total kinetic energy $ K $ to the gravitational potential energy $ W $:
$$
2K = -W
$$

- **Kinetic Energy**: For a system with 1D velocity dispersion $ v $, the 3D kinetic energy per unit mass is $ \frac{3}{2} v^2 $. Thus,
  $$
  K = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2
  $$

- **Gravitational Potential Energy**: For a uniform sphere of mass $ M_B $ and radius $ R $,
  $$
  W = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
  $$

Substituting into the virial theorem:
$$
2 \left( \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \right) = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$
$$
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$
Cancel $ 3 M_B $ from both sides:
$$
v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}
$$
Solving for $ M_B $:
$$
M_B = \frac{5 R v^2}{G}
$$

---

### **Final Results**

- **Mass of Galaxy A (Spiral):**
  $$
  \boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
  $$

- **Mass of Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical):**
  $$
  \boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
  $$

### **Key Insight**

- **Spiral galaxies** use **rotational velocity** to derive mass via the **circular orbit condition**.
- **Elliptical galaxies** use **velocity dispersion** and the **virial theorem** to account for the random motions of stars. The factor of 5 arises from the specific potential energy of a uniform sphere. 

Thus, Galaxy B (elliptical) has **5 times the mass** of Galaxy A (spiral) under the given conditions.",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"To determine the **density of a white dwarf** in terms of its total mass $ M $, atomic number $ Z $, mass number $ A $, and fundamental constants, we begin by equating the **electron degeneracy pressure** (which prevents gravitational collapse) to the **gravitational pressure** (which causes collapse). This equilibrium condition is key to deriving the density.

---

### **Step 1: Equating the Pressures**

The **electron degeneracy pressure** is given by:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}
$$
where $ n $ is the **number density of electrons**.

The **gravitational pressure** is derived from the total potential energy $ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} $, leading to:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GM^2}{5RV}
$$
with $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $ being the volume of the star.

---

### **Step 2: Expressing Electron Density in Terms of Star's Density**

In a white dwarf, each nucleus has $ Z $ electrons and a mass of approximately $ A m_p $, where $ m_p $ is the **proton mass**. The number density of electrons is:
$$
n = \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p}
$$
where $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} $ is the **mass density** of the star.

---

### **Step 3: Solving for $ \rho $**

Equating the two pressures and substituting $ n $ into the degeneracy pressure expression, we find:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5RV}
$$

Using $ V = \frac{M}{\rho} $ and $ R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} $, and simplifying, we eventually arrive at an expression for $ \rho $ in terms of $ M $, $ A $, $ Z $, and fundamental constants.

---

### **Final Expression for the Density**

After algebraic manipulation and unit consistency checks, the **density** of the white dwarf is:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4 G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5 A^5 M^2}{27 \pi^3 \hbar^6 Z^5}
}
$$

---

### **Key Physical Interpretation**

- $ G $: Gravitational constant  
- $ m_e $: Electron mass  
- $ m_p $: Proton mass (approximate nucleon mass)  
- $ \hbar $: Reduced Planck constant  
- $ A $: Mass number (nuclei mass)  
- $ Z $: Atomic number (number of electrons per nucleus)  
- $ M $: Total mass of the white dwarf  

This expression shows that:
- **Higher mass $ M $** increases the density.
- **Larger $ A $** (heavier nuclei) increases density due to fewer electrons per unit mass.
- **Larger $ Z $** (more electrons per nucleus) decreases density, as more electrons increase degeneracy pressure.
- The density scales **quadratically with $ M $** and **fifth power with $ A/Z $**.

This result is consistent with the physics of white dwarfs, where the **electron degeneracy pressure** dominates and balances **gravitational compression**.

13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

### Step 1: Substitute the expression for $ \vec{B} $ into the potential energy formula

We substitute the magnetic field $ \vec{B} $ (produced by $ \vec{m}_1 $) into the potential energy expression for $ \vec{m}_2 $:

$$

We are asked to derive the **total energy** and **orbital angular momentum** of an electron orbiting a proton under the influence of **Coulombic attraction**, with the assumption that the **proton mass is much larger than the electron mass** ($ m_p \gg m_e $). This allows us to treat the **proton as stationary**, simplifying the system to a **classical two-body problem** where the electron moves in a **circular orbit** around a fixed nucleus.

---

### **Step 1: Force Balance for Circular Motion**

The **Coulomb force** between the electron and proton provides the **centripetal force** required for circular motion:

$$
F_{\text{Coulomb}} = F_{\text{centripetal}}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}

### **Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum (L)**

For circular motion, the **angular momentum** is given by:

$$
L = m_e v r

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"### Solution

#### **Shape of the Orbit**
The conglomerate moves in a **closed orbit**, which is an **ellipse** since it is bounded and not circular (as the perigee $ r_p = R/2 $ and apogee $ r_a > R $).

---

### (i) Speed of the Meteorite Just Before the Collision

To determine the speed $ v_1 $ of the meteorite, we use conservation of angular momentum and energy. The total angular momentum before the collision is entirely due to the space station (since the meteorite's velocity is radial, contributing zero angular momentum):

$$
L_{\text{total}} = m_2 \sqrt{GM R}
$$

After the collision, the conglomerate has mass $ m_1 + m_2 $, and its angular momentum is conserved:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) v_p \left(\frac{R}{2}\right) = m_2 \sqrt{GM R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_p = \frac{2 m_2 \sqrt{GM}}{(m_1 + m_2) \sqrt{R}}
$$

Using energy conservation between the collision point $ r = R $ and the perigee $ r = R/2 $, we derive the condition for $ v_1 $. After algebraic manipulation, the expression for $ v_1 $ becomes:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1m_2}{m_1^2} }
$$

**Condition for Real $ v_1 $:**  
The numerator must be positive:
$$
m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1m_2 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_2 > m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6})
$$

---

### (ii) Minimum and Maximum Speeds of the Conglomerate

- **Maximum Speed (at Perigee):**  
  At $ r = R/2 $, the velocity is purely tangential. Using angular momentum conservation:

  $$
  v_{\text{max}} = v_p = \frac{2 m_2 \sqrt{GM}}{(m_1 + m_2) \sqrt{R}}
  $$

- **Minimum Speed (at Apogee):**  
  The apogee distance $ r_a $ is derived as $ r_a = \frac{m_2^2 R}{m_1 (m_1 + 2m_2)} $. Using angular momentum conservation $ v_a r_a = v_p (R/2) $, we find:

  $$
  v_{\text{min}} = \frac{m_1 (m_1 + 2m_2) \sqrt{GM}}{m_2 (m_1 + m_2) \sqrt{R}}
  $$

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To demonstrate that the **surface magnitude** of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe, we analyze how **surface brightness** (flux per unit solid angle) behaves under the inverse square law. Here's the step-by-step derivation:

---

### **1. Key Definitions**
- **Apparent magnitude $ m $** is related to flux $ F $ by:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10}(F) + C
  $$
  where $ C $ is a constant.
- **Surface magnitude $ \mu $** is defined as the magnitude corresponding to the **flux per unit solid angle** $ F_{\text{surface}} $:
  $$
  \mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(F_{\text{surface}}) + C
  $$
- **Flux per unit solid angle** is:
  $$
  F_{\text{surface}} = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{\Omega}
  $$
  where $ F_{\text{total}} $ is the total flux from the galaxy and $ \Omega $ is the solid angle it subtends.

---

### **2. Behavior of $ F_{\text{total}} $ and $ \Omega $ with Distance**
In a **non-expanding universe** (no redshift, no cosmological effects), the following hold:
- **Total flux** $ F_{\text{total}} $ from a galaxy follows the **inverse square law**:
  $$
  F_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
  $$
  where $ d $ is the distance to the galaxy.
- **Solid angle** $ \Omega $ subtended by the galaxy (for small angular sizes) is:
  $$
  \Omega \propto \left( \frac{D}{d} \right)^2
  $$
  where $ D $ is the physical size of the galaxy. Thus:
  $$
  \Omega \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
  $$

---

### **3. Surface Flux $ F_{\text{surface}} $**
Substitute $ F_{\text{total}} \propto 1/d^2 $ and $ \Omega \propto 1/d^2 $ into the expression for $ F_{\text{surface}} $:
$$
F_{\text{surface}} = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{\Omega} \propto \frac{1/d^2}{1/d^2} = \text{constant}
$$
This shows that **$ F_{\text{surface}} $ is independent of distance $ d $**.

---

### **4. Surface Magnitude $ \mu $**
Since $ F_{\text{surface}} $ is constant, the surface magnitude becomes:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(F_{\text{surface}}) + C
$$
The logarithm of a constant is also constant, so **$ \mu $ does not depend on $ d $**.

---

### **5. Physical Interpretation**
- The **total flux** decreases with $ 1/d^2 $, but the **solid angle** also decreases with $ 1/d^2 $.
- The **ratio $ F_{\text{total}} / \Omega $** (i.e., surface brightness) remains unchanged because both numerator and denominator scale equally with distance.
- This means the **intrinsic surface brightness** of the galaxy (as measured in flux per unit solid angle) is a property of the source itself, not the observer’s distance.

---

### **Conclusion**
In a **non-expanding universe**, the **surface magnitude** of a galaxy is **independent of its distance** because the **flux per unit solid angle** (which defines surface magnitude) remains constant as the galaxy moves farther away. This explains why extended objects like Andromeda appear ""dim"" not because they are faint, but because their light is spread over a large solid angle.

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{The surface magnitude is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe.}}

17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"### Derivation of Kepler’s Laws from the Law of Universal Gravitation

**1. Kepler’s First Law (Law of Ellipses):**  
*Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.*

#### Derivation:
- **Newton’s Law of Gravitation:** The gravitational force on a planet of mass $ m $ orbiting the Sun (mass $ M $) is $ F = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r} $, where $ r $ is the distance from the Sun and $ \hat{r} $ is the radial unit vector. This is a **central force** (radial direction only), so angular momentum $ L $ is conserved.
- **Polar Coordinates:** In polar coordinates $ (r, \theta) $, the motion is planar. The angular momentum is $ L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} $, which is constant. Thus, $ \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2} $.
- **Orbital Equation:** To find the orbit, substitute $ u = \frac{1}{r} $ and use the central force equation:
  $$
  \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{m}{L^2} \left| \vec{F} \right| = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} u^2.
  $$
  For an inverse-square force $ F = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} $, this simplifies to:
  $$
  \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2}.
  $$
- **Solution:** The general solution is:
  $$
  u = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0),
  $$
  where $ A $ and $ \theta_0 $ are constants. By redefining constants, this becomes:
  $$
  \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1 + e \cos(\theta - \theta_0)}{p},
  $$
  where $ e $ is the **eccentricity** and $ p $ is the **semi-latus rectum**. This is the equation of a **conic section**. For bound orbits (negative total energy), $ e < 1 $, so the orbit is an **ellipse** with the Sun at one focus.

---

**2. Kepler’s Second Law (Law of Equal Areas):**  
*The line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.*

#### Derivation:
- **Angular Momentum Conservation:** Since torque $ \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0 $ (force is radial), angular momentum $ L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} $ is conserved.
- **Area Swept per Time:** The infinitesimal area $ dA $ swept by the radius vector is:
  $$
  dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta.
  $$
  Differentiating with respect to time:
  $$
  \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{2m}.
  $$
- **Result:** Since $ L $ is constant, $ \frac{dA}{dt} $ is constant. Thus, **equal areas are swept in equal times**.

---

**3. Kepler’s Third Law (Harmonic Law):**  
*The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($ T^2 \propto a^3 $).*

#### Derivation:
- **Total Energy of the Orbit:** For an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $ a $, the total energy is:
  $$
  E = -\frac{G M m}{2a}.
  $$
- **Area of the Ellipse:** The area of an ellipse is $ \pi a b $, where $ b $ is the semi-minor axis. From Kepler’s second law:
  $$
  T = \frac{2\pi a b m}{L}.
  $$
- **Semi-Latus Rectum Relation:** The semi-latus rectum $ p = a(1 - e^2) $, and from the orbit equation:
  $$
  p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2}.
  $$
  Also, $ b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} $, so $ b = \sqrt{a p} $.
- **Substitute $ b $:** Using $ p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} $, we find:
  $$
  T = \frac{2\pi a \sqrt{a p}}{L} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2} L}{L \sqrt{G M m^2}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G M}}.
  $$
- **Final Result:** Squaring both sides gives:
  $$
  T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3.
  $$

---

### Summary of Key Steps:
1. **First Law:** Solved the orbital differential equation under inverse-square gravity, showing orbits are conic sections (ellipses for bound orbits).
2. **Second Law:** Directly derived from conservation of angular momentum, leading to constant area swept per time.
3. **Third Law:** Relating the period to the semi-major axis via the ellipse’s area and energy conservation, resulting in $ T^2 \propto a^3 $.

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude:

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

$\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{t}}&=(\Omega-\Omega_0)R_0\cos l-\Omega D=\frac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](-D\cos l)R_0\cos l-\Omega_0i=\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D\cos^2l-\Omega_0D=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D(1+\cos2l)-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}+\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}D\end{aligned}$

---

### **1. Key Relationships and Assumptions**

- The rotational velocity $ V = R \Omega $, where $ \Omega $ is the angular velocity.
- In the solar neighborhood, the difference in angular velocities $ \Omega - \Omega_0 $ is small, and we approximate:
  $$
  \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
  $$
  using the relation $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $ (from geometry of the triangle formed by the Sun, the Galactic Center, and the cloud).
- The derivative $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ can be related to $ \frac{dV}{dR} $ as:
  $$
  \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \left( \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R} \right)
  $$
  At $ R = R_0 $, this becomes:
  $$
  \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
  $$

---

### **2. Deriving Oort’s Constant $ A $**

From the line-of-sight velocity expression:
$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$
Substituting $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $, we get:
$$
V_r \approx -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l
$$
Using the identity $ \sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l $, we write:
$$
V_r = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
$$
Comparing with the given first-order approximation $ V_r = A D \sin 2l $, we identify:
$$
A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
$$
Substituting $ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ from above:
$$
A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{R_0} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

---

### **3. Deriving Oort’s Constant $ B $**

From the transverse velocity expression:
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$
Substituting $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $ and $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $ (since $ D \ll R_0 $), we get:
$$
V_t \approx -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$
Using the identity $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $, we expand:
$$
V_t = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D (1 + \cos 2l) - \Omega_0 D
$$
$$
= -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \left( \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right) D
$$
Comparing with the given form $ V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D $, we identify:
$$
B = -\left( \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right)
$$
Substituting $ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ and $ \Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0} $, we find:
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
$$

---

### **4. Final Expressions for $ A $ and $ B $**

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$
$$
\boxed{
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

These expressions are derived under the assumption that the solar neighborhood is characterized by small $ D $, and the rotation curve is analyzed in the vicinity of the Sun. The constants $ A $ and $ B $ capture the local shear (rate of change of angular velocity) and the local angular velocity of the Galactic rotation, respectively.",0.728

Consider a star that approaches the system from infinity with speed v and impact parameter b, in the reference frame of the CM (As shown in the figure)<image>GSTD-Fig-7</image>.

### **1. Total Mechanical Energy in a Circular Orbit**

For an object in a circular orbit around a central mass $ M $ at radius $ R $, the orbital velocity satisfies the Keplerian condition:

$$
v^2 = \frac{GM}{R}
$$

The **total mechanical energy per unit mass** is the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Substituting $ v^2 = \frac{GM}{R} $:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2R}
$$

This is the standard result for the total mechanical energy per unit mass in a circular orbit.

---

### **2. Energy Released During Accretion**

The gas starts at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ with energy per unit mass:

$$
E_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

It ends at radius $ r $ with energy per unit mass:

$$
E_{\text{final}} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

The **change in mechanical energy** (final minus initial) is:

$$
\Delta E = E_{\text{final}} - E_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{GM}{2r} + \frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

Since the process occurs slowly and the energy is dissipated as heat via viscous forces, the **energy released** (i.e., the magnitude of energy lost) is the **negative** of this change:

$$
\text{Energy released} = -\Delta E = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

---

### **3. Applying the Approximation $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $**

Given that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, the term $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} $ becomes negligible compared to $ \frac{1}{r} $. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the energy released is:

$$
\text{Energy released} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

---

### **4. Final Answer**

Thus, the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by the gas element as it moves from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $ is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}
$$

This expression is derived under the assumptions of a Keplerian orbit, slow accretion, and negligible gravitational interactions between disc particles. The energy released is directly proportional to $ \frac{1}{r} $, reflecting the strong gravitational binding energy at small radii.",0.728

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"To determine the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{GW} $ of a binary neutron star system, we begin by analyzing the physical units and applying dimensional analysis. The problem specifies that $ L_{GW} $ is a function of the gravitational constant $ G $, the speed of light $ c $, the mass $ M $ of each neutron star, and the orbital radius $ R $, with a dimensionless constant $ \frac{2}{5} $. Additionally, it is given that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Units of Power**

The gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{GW} $ has units of **power**, which is energy per unit time. In SI units, this corresponds to:

$$
[L_{GW}] = [M][L]^2[T]^{-3}
$$

where:
- $ [M] $ is the unit of mass,
- $ [L] $ is the unit of length,
- $ [T] $ is the unit of time.

---

### **Step 2: Express the Physical Constants in Terms of Base Units**

We now write the units of the variables involved:

- $ G $ (gravitational constant): $ [L]^3 [M]^{-1} [T]^{-2} $
- $ c $ (speed of light): $ [L][T]^{-1} $
- $ M $ (mass of each star): $ [M] $
- $ R $ (orbital radius): $ [L] $

Let us assume the general form:

$$
L_{GW} = k \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^c \cdot R^d
$$

where $ k = \frac{2}{5} $ is the dimensionless constant, and we need to find exponents $ a, b, c, d $ such that the product of the units matches $ [M][L]^2[T]^{-3} $.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Unit Equations**

Compute the combined units from $ G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^c \cdot R^d $:

- From $ G^a $: $ [L]^{3a} [M]^{-a} [T]^{-2a} $
- From $ c^b $: $ [L]^b [T]^{-b} $
- From $ M^c $: $ [M]^c $
- From $ R^d $: $ [L]^d $

Multiplying all together gives:

$$
[L]^{3a + b + d} \cdot [M]^{-a + c} \cdot [T]^{-2a - b}
$$

This must equal $ [M][L]^2[T]^{-3} $, so we equate exponents:

1. For mass: $ -a + c = 1 $
2. For length: $ 3a + b + d = 2 $
3. For time: $ -2a - b = -3 $

Additionally, the problem states that **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**, i.e., $ b = d $.

---

### **Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**

From equation (3):  
$$
-2a - b = -3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2a + b = 3 \quad \text{(1)}
$$

From equation (2) with $ d = b $:  
$$
3a + b + b = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3a + 2b = 2 \quad \text{(2)}
$$

Now solve equations (1) and (2):

From (1): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Substitute into (2):  
$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -a + 6 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = 4
$$

Then:  
$$
b = 3 - 2(4) = -5, \quad d = b = -5
$$

From equation (1):  
$$
c = a + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
$$

---

### **Step 5: Construct the Final Expression**

Using the values $ a = 4 $, $ b = -5 $, $ c = 5 $, $ d = -5 $, and the given dimensionless constant $ k = \frac{2}{5} $, the expression becomes:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

This is the correct expression for the gravitational wave luminosity in terms of the given constants and parameters.

### **Final Answer**

Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"To determine the rate of change of the orbital radius $ R $ in a binary neutron star system due to gravitational wave emission, we proceed as follows:

### **1. Total Energy of the System**

In a circular binary system with two identical masses $ M $, the separation between the stars is $ a = 2R $ (where $ R $ is the distance from each star to the center of mass). The total energy $ E $ of the system is given by:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{2a} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

This result is derived from the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy for equal-mass systems.

### **2. Rate of Change of Energy**

The system loses energy via gravitational waves at a rate $ \frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{GW} $, where $ L_{GW} $ is the luminosity (power radiated) due to gravitational waves. Given the expression:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

we compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using the chain rule:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4R} \right) = \frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

Setting this equal to $ -L_{GW} $:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = -L_{GW}
$$

Solving for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4 L_{GW}}{G M^2 R^2}
$$

---

### **3. Substituting the Gravitational Wave Luminosity**

Now substitute the given expression for $ L_{GW} $:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Substitute into the equation for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4}{G M^2 R^2} \cdot \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Simplify constants and exponents:

- Numerator: $ 4 \cdot 2 = 8 $
- $ G^4 / G = G^3 $
- $ M^5 / M^2 = M^3 $
- $ R^{-2} / R^5 = R^{-7} $

Thus:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^7}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^7}}
$$

This expression gives the rate at which the orbital radius $ R $ decreases due to gravitational wave emission in the binary neutron star system. The negative sign indicates that the orbit is shrinking over time.",0.49
