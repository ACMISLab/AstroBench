2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"The virial theorem is a powerful tool in astrophysics and mechanics, allowing us to relate the total kinetic energy of a stable, self-gravitating system to its total potential energy. It was first derived by Rudolf Clausius in 1870. The derivation starts directly from Newton's second law.

**Problem-Solving Process:**

1.  **Start with Newton's Second Law for a Single Particle:**
    For a single particle $i$ with mass $m_i$, position vector $r_i$, and momentum $p_i = m_i v_i$, Newton's second law states:
    $F_i = \frac{dp_i}{dt}$
    where $F_i$ is the resultant force acting on particle $i$.

2.  **Consider the Time Derivative of $r_i \cdot p_i$:**
    Let's consider the quantity $r_i \cdot p_i$. Its time derivative is given by the product rule:
    $\frac{d}{dt} (r_i \cdot p_i) = \frac{dr_i}{dt} \cdot p_i + r_i \cdot \frac{dp_i}{dt}$

    We know that $\frac{dr_i}{dt} = v_i$ (velocity of particle $i$).
    Substituting $p_i = m_i v_i$ and $\frac{dp_i}{dt} = F_i$:
    $\frac{d}{dt} (r_i \cdot p_i) = v_i \cdot (m_i v_i) + r_i \cdot F_i$
    $\frac{d}{dt} (r_i \cdot p_i) = m_i v_i^2 + r_i \cdot F_i$

3.  **Sum Over All Particles in the System:**
    Now, let's sum this equation over all $N$ particles in the system:
    $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{d}{dt} (r_i \cdot p_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (m_i v_i^2 + r_i \cdot F_i)$
    The left side can be written as the time derivative of the sum:
    $\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot F_i$

4.  **Define Kinetic Energy and Virial:**
    Let's define two important quantities:
    *   **Total Kinetic Energy ($K$):** The total kinetic energy of the system is $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2$.
        Therefore, $\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_i^2 = 2K$.
    *   **Virial ($\mathcal{G}$):** As defined in the problem, the virial is the sum of the inner product $r_i \cdot F_i$ over all molecules: $\mathcal{G} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot F_i$.

    Substituting these definitions into the equation from step 3:
    $\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) = 2K + \mathcal{G}$

5.  **Take the Time Average:**
    Let's consider the time average of this equation over a sufficiently long period $T$. We denote the time average of a quantity $X$ as $\langle X \rangle = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T X(t) dt$.
    Taking the time average of both sides:
    $\left\langle \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) \right\rangle = \langle 2K \rangle + \langle \mathcal{G} \rangle$

    The time average of the derivative term is:
    $\left\langle \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) \right\rangle = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) dt$
    $= \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \left[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right)_T - \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right)_0 \right]$

    For a stable, bounded system (like a galaxy or a star cluster that doesn't collapse or expand indefinitely), the quantity $\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i$ (often called the virial function or moment of inertia function) remains bounded over time. In this case, as $T \to \infty$, the average value of its time derivative approaches zero. This is because the difference between its final and initial values remains finite, while $T$ grows infinitely large.
    Therefore:
    $\left\langle \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \cdot p_i \right) \right\rangle = 0$

6.  **The General Virial Theorem:**
    Substituting this back into the averaged equation:
    $0 = \langle 2K \rangle + \langle \mathcal{G} \rangle$
    $\boxed{2\langle K \rangle = -\langle \mathcal{G} \rangle}$
    This is the general form of the virial theorem. It states that for a stable, bounded system, twice the time-averaged total kinetic energy is equal to the negative of the time-averaged virial.

7.  **Special Case: Gravitational Systems:**
    In many astrophysical applications, especially for galaxies and star clusters, the dominant force is gravity. Gravitational forces are conservative and can be derived from a potential energy function.
    For a system of particles interacting via inverse-square law forces (like gravity), the force on particle $i$ due to particle $j$ is $F_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|r_i - r_j|^3} (r_i - r_j)$.
    The total force on particle $i$ is $F_i = \sum_{j \neq i} F_{ij}$.

    The total potential energy $U$ of such a system is given by:
    $U = \sum_{i<j} U_{ij} = -\sum_{i<j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|r_i - r_j|}$
    This potential energy function is a homogeneous function of degree $-1$ in the coordinates (meaning if all coordinates $r_i$ are scaled by a factor $\lambda$, $U$ scales by $\lambda^{-1}$).
    According to Euler's homogeneous function theorem, for a potential $U$ that is a homogeneous function of degree $n$, we have:
    $\sum_i r_i \cdot \nabla_i U = nU$
    Since $F_i = -\nabla_i U$, the virial can be expressed as:
    $\mathcal{G} = \sum_i r_i \cdot F_i = \sum_i r_i \cdot (-\nabla_i U) = -\sum_i r_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -nU$
    For gravitational forces, $n = -1$, so:
    $\mathcal{G} = -(-1)U = U$

    Substituting $\langle \mathcal{G} \rangle = \langle U \rangle$ into the general virial theorem:
    $\boxed{2\langle K \rangle = -\langle U \rangle}$
    This is the most widely used form of the virial theorem in astrophysics for systems dominated by gravity. It implies that for a stable, self-gravitating system, the total kinetic energy is half the absolute value of the total potential energy.",0.546

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

$\mathrm{d} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 = - \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i^\top} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathrm{d} V$

Integrating yields the energy integral:
$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + V = \varepsilon$",No,"The problem asks us to derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system, given the dynamical equation for each body. The first integrals of motion are conserved quantities (constants of motion) of the system. For a system under central forces like gravity, these typically include total linear momentum, total angular momentum, and total energy.

The dynamical equation for body $i$ is given by:
$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

Let's denote the force exerted on body $i$ by body $j$ as $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$.
So, $\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$.
The equation of motion for body $i$ is $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \mathbf{F}_{ji}$.

### 1. Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

The total linear momentum of the system, $\mathbf{P}$, is the sum of the linear momenta of all individual bodies:
$\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{p}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$

To check for conservation, we differentiate $\mathbf{P}$ with respect to time:
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$

Substitute the given dynamical equation:
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \mathbf{F}_{ji}$

Consider a pair of interacting bodies, $i$ and $j$. The force exerted by $j$ on $i$ is $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$. The force exerted by $i$ on $j$ is $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$.
From the definition:
$\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$
$\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$

Since $|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|$ and $(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$, we can see that:
$\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)) = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$
Comparing $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$, we find that $\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij}$. This is Newton's third law of motion.

The double summation $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \mathbf{F}_{ji}$ includes every pair of interaction forces twice, once as $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$ and once as $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$. For example, it contains the term $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{21}$.
Since $\mathbf{F}_{ji} + \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \mathbf{0}$ for any pair $(i, j)$, the entire sum cancels out:
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \mathbf{0}$

Therefore, the total linear momentum $\mathbf{P}$ is a constant vector.
$\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}$
This provides three scalar first integrals (one for each Cartesian component of the vector).

### 2. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum

The total angular momentum of the system, $\mathbf{L}$, with respect to the origin is the sum of the angular momenta of all individual bodies:
$\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{L}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{p}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$

To check for conservation, we differentiate $\mathbf{L}$ with respect to time:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)$
Using the product rule for cross products, $\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) = \dot{\mathbf{A}} \times \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \times \dot{\mathbf{B}}$:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i)$

The first term, $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$, is zero because the cross product of a vector with a parallel vector is zero.
So, $\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$

Substitute the dynamical equation for $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j})$

Let's consider the sum for a pair of particles $(i, j)$. Let $C_{ij} = \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}$. Note that $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$.
The sum includes terms like $-C_{ij} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$ (from the $i$-th sum, considering $j$) and $-C_{ji} \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$ (from the $j$-th sum, considering $i$).
Let's analyze the sum of these two terms, corresponding to the interaction between $i$ and $j$:
$T_{ij} = -C_{ij} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - C_{ji} \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$
Since $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$ and $(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$:
$T_{ij} = -C_{ij} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - C_{ij} \mathbf{r}_j \times (-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j))$
$T_{ij} = -C_{ij} \left[ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right]$
Using the distributive property of the cross product, $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{C} - \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{C} = (\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}) \times \mathbf{C}$:
$T_{ij} = -C_{ij} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right]$
The cross product of a vector with itself is zero: $(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{0}$.
Therefore, $T_{ij} = \mathbf{0}$.

Since all such pairs of terms sum to zero, the total sum is zero:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{0}$

Therefore, the total angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ is a constant vector.
$\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}$
This provides three scalar first integrals.

### 3. Conservation of Total Energy

The total energy of the system, $E$, is the sum of its total kinetic energy $K$ and total potential energy $V$.
The kinetic energy of body $i$ is $K_i = \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2$.
The total kinetic energy is $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} K_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$.

The gravitational potential energy between two bodies $i$ and $j$ is $V_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.
The total potential energy of the system is the sum over all unique pairs:
$V = \sum_{\substack{i,j=1 \\ i<j}}^{N} V_{ij} = -\sum_{\substack{i,j=1 \\ i<j}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$
This can also be written as $V = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.

To check for conservation, we differentiate $E = K + V$ with respect to time:
$\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dK}{dt} + \frac{dV}{dt}$

First, let's calculate $\frac{dK}{dt}$:
$\frac{dK}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i (2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$
Substitute $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$ from the equation of motion:
$\frac{dK}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{dK}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j})$

Next, let's calculate $\frac{dV}{dt}$:
$\frac{dV}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} G m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right)$
Let $\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j$ and $r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_{ij}|$.
Then $\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \frac{dr_{ij}}{dt}$.
We know that $r_{ij}^2 = \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij}$. Differentiating with respect to time:
$2 r_{ij} \frac{dr_{ij}}{dt} = 2 \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = 2 (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$.
So, $\frac{dr_{ij}}{dt} = \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.
Substituting this back:
$\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right) = -\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^2} \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$
$= -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}$.

Now substitute this into the expression for $\frac{dV}{dt}$:
$\frac{dV}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} G m_i m_j \left( -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right)$
$\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$

Now, let's sum $\frac{dK}{dt}$ and $\frac{dV}{dt}$:
$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$
Let $D_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}$. Note $D_{ij} = D_{ji}$.
The expression for $\frac{dE}{dt}$ becomes:
$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$

Consider the first term: $\sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$.
This sum includes pairs like $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$. The term for $(j, i)$ is $D_{ji} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$.
Since $D_{ij} = D_{ji}$ and $(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$, we can rewrite the first term as:
$\sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \left[ D_{ij} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + D_{ji} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right]$
$= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} \left[ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)) \right]$
$= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} \left[ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right]$
$= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$

Now substitute this back into the expression for $\frac{dE}{dt}$:
$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} D_{ij} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$
These two terms are identical but with opposite signs. Therefore, they cancel out:
$\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$

Thus, the total energy $E$ is a constant scalar.
$E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \sum_{\substack{i,j=1 \\ i<j}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}$
This provides one scalar first integral.

### Summary of First Integrals of Motion

For an N-body system governed by the given gravitational dynamical equations, the first integrals of motion are:

1.  **Conservation of Total Linear Momentum:**
    The total linear momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of the system is constant.
    $\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$
    (This represents 3 independent scalar integrals, corresponding to the conservation of momentum along x, y, and z axes.)

2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**
    The total angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ of the system (about the origin) is constant.
    $\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$
    (This represents 3 independent scalar integrals, corresponding to the conservation of angular momentum about x, y, and z axes.)

3.  **Conservation of Total Energy:**
    The total mechanical energy $E$ of the system is constant.
    $E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \sum_{\substack{i,j=1 \\ i<j}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant scalar}$
    (This represents 1 independent scalar integral.)

In total, there are 7 scalar first integrals for an N-body system under gravity.",0.714

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"To prove the formulas for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion for a celestial body in elliptical motion, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and known orbital parameters for an elliptical path.

**1. Definitions and Fundamental Principles**

*   **Celestial Body Mass:** $m$
*   **Central Body Mass:** $M$
*   **Standard Gravitational Parameter:** $\mu = GM$ (where $G$ is the gravitational constant)
*   **Semi-major axis:** $a$
*   **Eccentricity:** $e$
*   **Distance at Aphelion ($r_A$):** The farthest point from the central body. For an ellipse, $r_A = a(1+e)$.
*   **Distance at Perihelion ($r_P$):** The closest point to the central body. For an ellipse, $r_P = a(1-e)$.

**Conservation of Specific Orbital Energy ($\mathcal{E}$):**
For a body in orbit under a central gravitational force, the total specific orbital energy (energy per unit mass) is constant.
$\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{\mu}{r}$
For an elliptical orbit, the specific orbital energy is also given by:
$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$

Therefore, we can equate these two expressions for specific energy:
$\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$

This equation will be the primary tool for deriving the velocities.

---

**2. Derivation of Velocity at Aphelion ($v_A$)**

At aphelion, the distance from the central body is $r_A = a(1+e)$, and the velocity is $v_A$.
Substitute these into the energy equation:

$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 - \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$

Now, we solve for $v_A$:
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$

To combine the terms on the right side, find a common denominator, which is $2a(1+e)$:
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{2a(1+e)} - \frac{\mu(1+e)}{2a(1+e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu - \mu(1+e)}{2a(1+e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu - \mu - \mu e}{2a(1+e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu - \mu e}{2a(1+e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu(1-e)}{2a(1+e)}$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$v_A^2 = \frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}$

Take the square root of both sides to get $v_A$:
$v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$

This can be rewritten as:
$v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

---

**3. Derivation of Velocity at Perihelion ($v_P$)**

At perihelion, the distance from the central body is $r_P = a(1-e)$, and the velocity is $v_P$.
Substitute these into the energy equation:

$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 - \frac{\mu}{a(1-e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$

Now, we solve for $v_P$:
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1-e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$

To combine the terms on the right side, find a common denominator, which is $2a(1-e)$:
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu}{2a(1-e)} - \frac{\mu(1-e)}{2a(1-e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu - \mu(1-e)}{2a(1-e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu - \mu + \mu e}{2a(1-e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu + \mu e}{2a(1-e)}$
$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu(1+e)}{2a(1-e)}$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$v_P^2 = \frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}$

Take the square root of both sides to get $v_P$:
$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}$

This can be rewritten as:
$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$

---

Thus, we have successfully proven the formulas for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion for a celestial body in elliptical motion:

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"To find the expression relating the period $P$ of a satellite to its distance $d$ from the center of a very long cylindrical planet, we need to follow these steps:

1.  **Determine the gravitational field (or force) due to an infinitely long cylinder.**
2.  **Equate this gravitational force to the centripetal force required for a circular orbit.**
3.  **Solve for the period $P$.**

We will assume the satellite orbits in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder's axis and that the satellite's mass is negligible compared to the planet's mass. The planet has a uniform density $\rho$ and radius $R$. The satellite is orbiting at a distance $d$ from the center of the cylinder, so $d > R$.

---

### Step 1: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

We can use Gauss's Law for Gravitation, which states $\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{enc}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\vec{g}$ is the gravitational field, and $M_{enc}$ is the mass enclosed by the Gaussian surface.

Consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $d$ and length $L$, concentric with the planet cylinder.
*   **Symmetry:** Due to the infinite length of the cylinder, the gravitational field $\vec{g}$ will be purely radial (perpendicular to the cylinder's axis) and its magnitude will be constant on the curved surface of the Gaussian cylinder. The flux through the end caps of the Gaussian cylinder will be zero because $\vec{g}$ is parallel to these surfaces (or more accurately, perpendicular to their area vectors).
*   **Flux:** The flux through the curved surface of the Gaussian cylinder is $g \times (2\pi d L)$.
*   **Enclosed Mass ($M_{enc}$):** The mass per unit length ($\lambda$) of the planet is the density times its cross-sectional area:
    $\lambda = \rho \times (\pi R^2)$
    For a length $L$ of the planet, the enclosed mass within the Gaussian surface (since $d > R$) is:
    $M_{enc} = \lambda L = \rho \pi R^2 L$

Now, applying Gauss's Law (ignoring the negative sign as we are interested in the magnitude of the force/field):
$g (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)$

Solve for $g$:
$g = \frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L}$
$g = \frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d}$

This is the gravitational acceleration (gravitational field strength) at a distance $d$ from the center of the cylindrical planet.

The gravitational force $F_g$ on a satellite of mass $m$ is $F_g = m g$:
$F_g = m \frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d}$

---

### Step 2: Centripetal Force for a Circular Orbit

For a satellite of mass $m$ to maintain a circular orbit of radius $d$ with period $P$, it requires a centripetal force $F_c$.
The orbital velocity $v$ is related to the period by $v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}$.
The centripetal force is given by:
$F_c = \frac{m v^2}{d}$
Substitute the expression for $v$:
$F_c = \frac{m (\frac{2\pi d}{P})^2}{d}$
$F_c = \frac{m (4\pi^2 d^2 / P^2)}{d}$
$F_c = \frac{4\pi^2 m d}{P^2}$

---

### Step 3: Equate Forces and Solve for Period $P$

For the satellite to remain in orbit, the gravitational force must provide the necessary centripetal force:
$F_g = F_c$
$m \frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2 m d}{P^2}$

We can cancel the satellite's mass $m$ from both sides:
$\frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}$

Now, rearrange the equation to solve for $P^2$:
$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d \cdot d}{2 G \rho \pi R^2}$
$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2 G \rho \pi R^2}$
$P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}$

Finally, take the square root to find the period $P$:
$P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}}$
$P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}$

---

### Conclusion

The expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the cylindrical planet is:

$\boxed{P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}}$",0.637
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

The velocity distribution in an elliptical galaxy is uniform and random. Then, we can use the Virial theorem ($T=-U/2$) to calculate the velocity at the edge of the galaxy.

Conclude: 

$1/2Mv_{tot}^{2}=\frac{3}{10}\frac{GM^{2}}{R}\Longrightarrow M=\frac{5}{3}\frac{v_{tot}^{2}R}{G}$

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"The problem asks us to calculate the masses of two different types of galaxies, A and B, based on given characteristics. We will approach each galaxy separately using the appropriate astrophysical formulas.

### Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy

For a spiral galaxy, the rotational velocity of stars (or gas) at a given distance from the center is primarily due to the gravitational pull of the mass enclosed within that radius. We assume a star or gas cloud of mass $m$ is on a circular orbit at a distance $R$ from the center of Galaxy A.

1.  **Gravitational Force ($F_g$):** The gravitational force exerted by the mass $M_A$ enclosed within radius $R$ on a star of mass $m$ at that radius is:
    $F_g = \frac{G M_A m}{R^2}$
    where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.

2.  **Centripetal Force ($F_c$):** For an object moving in a circular orbit with velocity $v$ at radius $R$, the centripetal force required is:
    $F_c = \frac{m v^2}{R}$

3.  **Equating Forces:** For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force must provide the necessary centripetal force:
    $F_g = F_c$
    $\frac{G M_A m}{R^2} = \frac{m v^2}{R}$

4.  **Solving for $M_A$:** We can cancel $m$ from both sides and simplify:
    $\frac{G M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}$
    $G M_A = v^2 R$
    $M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$

Thus, the mass of Galaxy A (specifically, the mass enclosed within radius R) is $\frac{v^2 R}{G}$.

### Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy

For an elliptical galaxy, stars do not follow simple circular orbits; their motion is more random. For a self-gravitating system in equilibrium, the Virial Theorem is generally applicable. The problem states that Galaxy B is a ""spherical elliptical"" composed of ""uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" and has a radial velocity dispersion equal to $v$. This implies a uniform density spherical mass distribution.

1.  **Virial Theorem:** For a self-gravitating, bound system in dynamical equilibrium, the Virial Theorem states:
    $2K + U = 0$
    where $K$ is the total kinetic energy and $U$ is the total gravitational potential energy of the system.

2.  **Total Kinetic Energy ($K$):**
    Let $M_B$ be the total mass of Galaxy B. The kinetic energy of a system of stars is $K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v_{tot}^2 \rangle$, where $\langle v_{tot}^2 \rangle$ is the mean-square velocity of all stars.
    We are given the radial velocity dispersion $\sigma_r = v$. For a spherical system with isotropic velocity dispersion (meaning the velocity dispersion is the same in all three spatial directions, $\sigma_r = \sigma_\theta = \sigma_\phi$), the mean-square total velocity is:
    $\langle v_{tot}^2 \rangle = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_\theta^2 + \sigma_\phi^2 = 3\sigma_r^2 = 3v^2$
    Therefore, the total kinetic energy is:
    $K = \frac{1}{2} M_B (3v^2) = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2$

3.  **Total Potential Energy ($U$):**
    Since Galaxy B is described as a ""spherical elliptical"" with ""uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" (implying uniform density) and a radius $R$, its gravitational potential energy can be calculated for a uniform sphere of mass $M_B$ and radius $R$. The formula for the gravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is:
    $U = - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}$

4.  **Applying the Virial Theorem:** Substitute the expressions for $K$ and $U$ into the Virial Theorem:
    $2 \left( \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \right) + \left( - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} \right) = 0$
    $3 M_B v^2 - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0$

5.  **Solving for $M_B$:** We can divide by $M_B$ (since $M_B \neq 0$):
    $3 v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}$
    Now, solve for $M_B$:
    $M_B = \frac{3 v^2 R}{G} \cdot \frac{5}{3}$
    $M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}$

Thus, the mass of Galaxy B is $\frac{5 v^2 R}{G}$.

### Summary of Results:

*   **Mass of Galaxy A ($M_A$):**
    $M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$

*   **Mass of Galaxy B ($M_B$):**
    $M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}$",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"White dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. The equilibrium condition for a white dwarf is that the outward electron degeneracy pressure ($p_{electron}$) balances the inward gravitational pressure ($p_{grav}$).

**1. Calculate the Gravitational Pressure ($p_{grav}$):**
The problem provides the total potential energy $\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$ and the formula for gravitational pressure $p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}$.
The volume of a spherical star of radius $R$ is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$.

Substitute $\Omega$ into the $p_{grav}$ formula:
$p_{grav} = -\frac{1}{3V} \left(-\frac{3GM^2}{5R}\right) = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}$

Now substitute $V$:
$p_{grav} = \frac{GM^2}{5\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\right)R} = \frac{GM^2}{\frac{20}{3}\pi R^4} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$

**2. Calculate the Electron Degeneracy Pressure ($p_{electron}$):**
The electron degeneracy pressure is given by $p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$, where $n$ is the number density of electrons.

To find $n$, we need the total number of electrons ($N_e$) and the volume ($V$).
The total mass of the star $M$ is predominantly due to the nuclei. Let $m_u$ be the atomic mass unit.
The mass of a single nucleus is approximately $A \cdot m_u$.
The total number of nuclei in the star is $N_{nuclei} = \frac{M}{A \cdot m_u}$.
Each nucleus has $Z$ electrons. Therefore, the total number of electrons is $N_e = Z \cdot N_{nuclei} = \frac{ZM}{A \cdot m_u}$.

Now, the electron number density $n$ is:
$n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{ZM / (A \cdot m_u)}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3ZM}{4\pi A m_u R^3}$

Substitute this expression for $n$ into the $p_{electron}$ formula:
$p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3ZM}{4\pi A m_u R^3}\right)^{5/3}$
$p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^5}$

**3. Equate Pressures and Solve for the Radius ($R$):**
At equilibrium, $p_{electron} = p_{grav}$:
$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^5} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$

To solve for $R$, we can simplify by canceling $R^4$ from both sides and rearranging:
$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}$

Now, isolate $R$:
$R = \frac{20\pi}{3GM^2} \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}\right)^{5/3} M^{5/3}$
$R = \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3Gm_e} M^{(5/3 - 2)} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}\right)^{5/3}$
$R = \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3Gm_e} M^{-1/3} (3^{2/3}\pi^{4/3}) \frac{3^{5/3}Z^{5/3}}{4^{5/3}\pi^{5/3}A^{5/3}m_u^{5/3}}$

Combine the constant terms:
$R = \frac{4 \cdot 3^{2/3} \cdot 3^{5/3} \cdot \pi \cdot \pi^{4/3} \hbar^2 Z^{5/3}}{3 \cdot 4^{5/3} \cdot \pi^{5/3} G m_e A^{5/3} m_u^{5/3}} M^{-1/3}$
$R = \frac{4^{1} \cdot 3^{(2/3+5/3)} \cdot \pi^{(1+4/3)} \hbar^2 Z^{5/3}}{3^1 \cdot 4^{5/3} \cdot \pi^{5/3} G m_e A^{5/3} m_u^{5/3}} M^{-1/3}$
$R = \frac{4^1 \cdot 3^{7/3} \cdot \pi^{7/3} \hbar^2 Z^{5/3}}{3^1 \cdot 4^{5/3} \cdot \pi^{5/3} G m_e A^{5/3} m_u^{5/3}} M^{-1/3}$
$R = \left(4^{1-5/3} \cdot 3^{7/3-1} \cdot \pi^{7/3-5/3}\right) \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}$
$R = \left(4^{-2/3} \cdot 3^{4/3} \cdot \pi^{2/3}\right) \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}$
We can write the constant term more compactly:
$R = \left(\frac{3^4 \pi^2}{4^2}\right)^{1/3} \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}$
$R = \left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right)^{1/3} \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}$

Let $K = \left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right)^{1/3} \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3}$. So $R = K M^{-1/3}$.

**4. Calculate the Density ($\rho$):**
The density of the white dwarf is $\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Substitute $R = K M^{-1/3}$ into the density formula:
$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi (K M^{-1/3})^3}$
$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi K^3 (M^{-1/3})^3}$
$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi K^3 M^{-1}}$
$\rho = \frac{M^2}{\frac{4}{3}\pi K^3}$

Now substitute the full expression for $K^3$:
$K^3 = \left(\left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right)^{1/3} \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3}\right)^3$
$K^3 = \left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right) \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e}\right)^3 \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5$
$K^3 = \left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right) \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5$

Substitute $K^3$ back into the density equation:
$\rho = \frac{M^2}{\frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{81 \pi^2}{16}\right) \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5}$
$\rho = \frac{M^2}{\frac{4 \cdot 81 \pi^3}{3 \cdot 16} \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5}$
$\rho = \frac{M^2}{\frac{324 \pi^3}{48} \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5}$
$\rho = \frac{M^2}{\frac{27 \pi^3}{4} \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^5}$

Finally, rearrange to get the density:
$\rho = \frac{4 M^2}{27 \pi^3} \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left(\frac{A m_u}{Z}\right)^5$

The final answer is $\boxed{\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left(\frac{A m_u}{Z}\right)^5 M^2}$.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

We are provided with two fundamental formulas:

1.  **Magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$**:
    $\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

2.  **Potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$**:
    $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$

We will use these two formulas to find the interaction energy.

### Problem-Solving Process:

**Step 1: Define the roles of the two dipoles.**
Let $\vec{m}_1$ be the source of the magnetic field, and $\vec{m}_2$ be the dipole experiencing the potential energy in that field. The vector $\vec{r}$ points from the position of $\vec{m}_1$ to the position of $\vec{m}_2$.

**Step 2: Calculate the magnetic field produced by $\vec{m}_1$ at the location of $\vec{m}_2$.**
Using the first formula, the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ generated by $\vec{m}_1$ at the position $\vec{r}$ (where $\vec{m}_2$ is located) is:
$\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$

**Step 3: Calculate the potential energy of $\vec{m}_2$ in the field $\vec{B}_1$.**
Using the second formula, the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of dipole $\vec{m}_2$ in the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ is:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1(\vec{r})$

**Step 4: Substitute the expression for $\vec{B}_1(\vec{r})$ into the potential energy formula.**
$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right)$

**Step 5: Simplify the expression by performing the dot product.**
We can factor out the constant terms $\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3}$:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right) \right]$

Now, distribute the dot product $\vec{m}_2 \cdot$ inside the square brackets:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]$

For the first term, $(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})$ is a scalar quantity. So, the expression becomes:
$\vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})) = 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})$

Also, recall that the dot product is commutative, so $\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 = \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2$.

Substituting these back into the expression for $U_{\text{int}}$:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]$

Finally, distributing the negative sign to make the expression more commonly seen:
$U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]$

This formula represents the interaction energy between two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1$ and $\vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $r$.",0.49

The electrostatic potential energy between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:
$U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$
For the electron-proton system:
$U = k \frac{(+e)(-e)}{r}$
$U = -k \frac{e^2}{r}$

#### b. Kinetic Energy ($K$)
The kinetic energy of the electron with mass $m_e$ and orbital speed $v$ is:
$K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2$

To find $v$, we use the condition for a stable circular orbit: the Coulombic attraction provides the necessary centripetal force.
Centripetal force: $F_c = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}$
Coulombic force (magnitude): $F_{Coulomb} = k \frac{|q_e q_p|}{r^2} = k \frac{e^2}{r^2}$

Equating these forces:
$\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = k \frac{e^2}{r^2}$
Multiply by $r$:
$m_e v^2 = k \frac{e^2}{r}$

Now substitute this into the kinetic energy expression:
$K = \frac{1}{2} \left( k \frac{e^2}{r} \right)$
$K = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r}$

#### c. Total Energy ($E$)
The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies:
$E = K + U$
$E = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r} - k \frac{e^2}{r}$
$E = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r}$

Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$\boxed{E = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 r}}$

### 2. Orbital Momentum ($L$)

The orbital momentum (or angular momentum) of a point mass $m_e$ orbiting at radius $r$ with speed $v$ is given by:
$L = m_e v r$ (for a circular orbit where the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector)

We already found an expression for $v^2$ from the force balance:
$m_e v^2 = k \frac{e^2}{r}$
$v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}$
Taking the square root to find $v$:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}$

Now substitute this expression for $v$ into the angular momentum equation:
$L = m_e \left( \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \right) r$
$L = m_e r \frac{\sqrt{k} e}{\sqrt{m_e r}}$
To simplify, bring $m_e r$ inside the square root by squaring it:
$L = \sqrt{(m_e r)^2 \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}$
$L = \sqrt{m_e^2 r^2 \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}$
$L = \sqrt{m_e r k e^2}$
$L = e \sqrt{m_e r k}$

Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$\boxed{L = e \sqrt{\frac{m_e r}{4\pi\epsilon_0}}}$",0.637
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"This problem involves a collision followed by orbital motion. We'll use principles of conservation of momentum and energy, along with standard formulas for elliptical orbits.

Let $M$ be the mass of the Earth, $G$ the gravitational constant, $m_1$ the mass of the meteorite, and $m_2$ the mass of the space station. $R$ is the radius of the space station's circular orbit and also the radius at which the collision occurs.

**1. Initial State before Collision:**
*   **Space Station:** Orbits in a circular path of radius $R$. Its speed is the circular orbital velocity:
    $v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$
    Its velocity vector $\vec{v}_s$ is purely tangential to the orbit.
*   **Meteorite:** Radially approaching the Earth. Its velocity vector $\vec{v}_m$ is purely radial and points towards the Earth's center. Let its speed just before impact be $v_m$.

**2. Collision (Inelastic):**
The meteorite and space station collide and form a conglomerate of mass $m = m_1 + m_2$. Momentum is conserved during the collision. Let's define a coordinate system at the point of collision: $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing radially outward from Earth's center, and $\hat{\theta}$ is the unit vector tangential to the orbit in the direction of the space station's motion.

*   Initial momentum of the meteorite: $\vec{p}_1 = m_1 \vec{v}_m = -m_1 v_m \hat{r}$ (negative because it's approaching radially inward).
*   Initial momentum of the space station: $\vec{p}_2 = m_2 \vec{v}_s = m_2 v_s \hat{\theta}$.
*   Total initial momentum: $\vec{P}_{initial} = -m_1 v_m \hat{r} + m_2 v_s \hat{\theta}$.

After the collision, the conglomerate moves with velocity $\vec{V}_c = V_r \hat{r} + V_\theta \hat{\theta}$ at radius $R$.
*   Total final momentum: $\vec{P}_{final} = (m_1+m_2) \vec{V}_c$.

By conservation of momentum $\vec{P}_{initial} = \vec{P}_{final}$:
$(m_1+m_2) V_r = -m_1 v_m \implies V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_m}{m_1+m_2}$
$(m_1+m_2) V_\theta = m_2 v_s \implies V_\theta = \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{m_2 \sqrt{GM/R}}{m_1+m_2}$

**3. Conglomerate's Orbit:**
The conglomerate moves in a closed orbit, which is an ellipse because its minimum distance ($R/2$) is different from its collision distance ($R$).
At the collision point (radius $R$), the conglomerate has radial velocity $V_r$ and tangential velocity $V_\theta$.

The orbital parameters for the conglomerate (mass $m_1+m_2$) are determined by its total energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$.
*   **Angular momentum at collision point $R$**: $L = (m_1+m_2) R V_\theta$.
    $L = (m_1+m_2) R \left( \frac{m_2 \sqrt{GM/R}}{m_1+m_2} \right) = m_2 R \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}$.
    So, $L^2 = m_2^2 GMR$.

*   **Total energy at collision point $R$**: $E = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)(V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R}$.
    $E = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2) \left[ \left(-\frac{m_1 v_m}{m_1+m_2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m_2 \sqrt{GM/R}}{m_1+m_2}\right)^2 \right] - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R}$
    $E = \frac{1}{2(m_1+m_2)} \left[ m_1^2 v_m^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R}$.

For an elliptical orbit, the energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ are also related to the semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$:
*   $E = -\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{2a}$
*   $L^2 = GM(m_1+m_2)^2 a(1-e^2)$

We are given the pericenter (minimum distance) $r_p = R/2$.
For an ellipse, $r_p = a(1-e)$. So, $R/2 = a(1-e)$.

Now we use these relations to find $a$ and $e$.
From $L^2 = GM(m_1+m_2)^2 a(1-e^2)$ and $L^2 = m_2^2 GMR$:
$m_2^2 GMR = GM(m_1+m_2)^2 a(1-e^2)$
$m_2^2 R = (m_1+m_2)^2 a(1-e^2)$ (Equation 1)

Substitute $a = R/(2(1-e))$ into Equation 1:
$m_2^2 R = (m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{R}{2(1-e)}(1-e^2) = (m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{R}{2}(1+e)$
$2m_2^2 = (m_1+m_2)^2 (1+e)$
From this, we can find the eccentricity $e$:
$1+e = \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} \implies e = \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} - 1$.

Now find the semi-major axis $a$:
$a = \frac{R}{2(1-e)} = \frac{R}{2\left(1 - \left(\frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} - 1\right)\right)} = \frac{R}{2\left(2 - \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)}$
$a = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4(m_1+m_2)^2 - 4m_2^2} = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4(m_1^2 + 2m_1m_2 + m_2^2 - m_2^2)} = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4(m_1^2 + 2m_1m_2)}$
$a = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$.

**Shape of the orbit:**
Since $r_p = R/2$ and the collision occurs at $R$, the orbit is clearly elliptical.

---

**(i) The speed of the meteorite just before the collision ($v_m$):**
Equate the two expressions for energy $E$:
$\frac{1}{2(m_1+m_2)} \left[ m_1^2 v_m^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R} = -\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{2a}$
Multiply by $2R(m_1+m_2)$:
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 + m_2^2 GM - 2GM(m_1+m_2)^2 = -GM(m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{R}{a}$
Substitute $a = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$, so $\frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{a} = \frac{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R}$:
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 + m_2^2 GM - 2GM(m_1+m_2)^2 = -GM \cdot 4m_1(m_1+2m_2)$
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 = GM [2(m_1+m_2)^2 - m_2^2 - 4m_1(m_1+2m_2)]$
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 = GM [2(m_1^2+2m_1m_2+m_2^2) - m_2^2 - 4m_1^2 - 8m_1m_2]$
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 = GM [2m_1^2+4m_1m_2+2m_2^2 - m_2^2 - 4m_1^2 - 8m_1m_2]$
$R m_1^2 v_m^2 = GM [-2m_1^2 - 4m_1m_2 + m_2^2]$
$v_m^2 = \frac{GM}{R m_1^2} (m_2^2 - 4m_1m_2 - 2m_1^2)$
$v_m = \frac{1}{m_1}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R} (m_2^2 - 4m_1m_2 - 2m_1^2)}$

---

**(iii) The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth ($r_{max}$):**
The maximum distance (apocenter) is $r_{max} = a(1+e)$.
Using our expressions for $a$ and $(1+e)$:
$r_{max} = \left(\frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}\right) \left(\frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
$r_{max} = \frac{2R m_2^2}{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$

---

**(ii) The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate:**
The speeds at pericenter ($r_p = R/2$) and apocenter ($r_a = r_{max}$) are given by the Vis-viva equation: $V^2 = GM \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)$.

*   **Maximum speed ($V_{max}$) at pericenter ($r_p = R/2$):**
    $V_{max}^2 = GM \left(\frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a}\right) = GM \left(\frac{4}{R} - \frac{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
    $V_{max}^2 = \frac{4GM}{R} \left(1 - \frac{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right) = \frac{4GM}{R} \left(\frac{(m_1+m_2)^2 - (m_1^2+2m_1m_2)}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
    $V_{max}^2 = \frac{4GM}{R} \left(\frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+m_2^2 - m_1^2-2m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right) = \frac{4GM}{R} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}$
    $V_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$

*   **Minimum speed ($V_{min}$) at apocenter ($r_a = r_{max}$):**
    $V_{min}^2 = GM \left(\frac{2}{r_{max}} - \frac{1}{a}\right) = GM \left(\frac{2}{\frac{R m_2^2}{2m_1(m_1+2m_2)}} - \frac{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
    $V_{min}^2 = GM \left(\frac{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R m_2^2} - \frac{4m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
    $V_{min}^2 = \frac{4GM m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R} \left(\frac{1}{m_2^2} - \frac{1}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\right)$
    $V_{min}^2 = \frac{4GM m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R} \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2 - m_2^2}{m_2^2(m_1+m_2)^2}$
    $V_{min}^2 = \frac{4GM m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2}{m_2^2(m_1+m_2)^2} = \frac{4GM m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{R} \frac{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{m_2^2(m_1+m_2)^2}$
    $V_{min}^2 = \frac{4GM m_1^2 (m_1+2m_2)^2}{R m_2^2 (m_1+m_2)^2}$
    $V_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{m_2(m_1+m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$

---

**Condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey:**
For this scenario to be possible, several conditions must be met:
1.  The orbit must be elliptical (closed), so $0 \le e < 1$.
2.  The speed of the meteorite $v_m$ must be real and positive (as it is ""radially approaching"").

*   **Condition for $e < 1$**:
    $e = \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} - 1 < 1 \implies \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} < 2 \implies m_2^2 < (m_1+m_2)^2$.
    Since masses are positive, $m_2 < m_1+m_2$, which is true if $m_1 > 0$.

*   **Condition for $e \ge 0$**:
    $e \ge 0 \implies \frac{2m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} - 1 \ge 0 \implies 2m_2^2 \ge (m_1+m_2)^2$.
    Taking the square root (and noting masses are positive): $\sqrt{2}m_2 \ge m_1+m_2 \implies (\sqrt{2}-1)m_2 \ge m_1$.
    This means $m_2/m_1 \ge 1/(\sqrt{2}-1) = \sqrt{2}+1 \approx 2.414$.

*   **Condition for $v_m^2 > 0$**:
    From the expression for $v_m^2$, we need $m_2^2 - 4m_1m_2 - 2m_1^2 > 0$.
    To compare with the eccentricity condition, divide by $m_1^2$: $(m_2/m_1)^2 - 4(m_2/m_1) - 2 > 0$.
    Let $x = m_2/m_1$. Then $x^2 - 4x - 2 > 0$.
    The roots of $x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0$ are $x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{24}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{6}$.
    Since $m_1, m_2$ are positive, $x = m_2/m_1$ must be positive. Therefore, $x > 2+\sqrt{6}$.
    $2+\sqrt{6} \approx 2+2.449 = 4.449$.
    So, $m_2/m_1 > 2+\sqrt{6}$.

This condition ($m_2/m_1 > 2+\sqrt{6}$) is stricter than the condition for $e \ge 0$ ($m_2/m_1 \ge \sqrt{2}+1$). If $m_2/m_1 > 2+\sqrt{6}$ is met, then $m_2/m_1 \ge \sqrt{2}+1$ is also met, and $e \ge 0$ is satisfied. The condition for $e<1$ is satisfied as long as $m_1 > 0$.

Therefore, the condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible is:
$m_2^2 - 4m_1m_2 - 2m_1^2 > 0$.

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe, we will first derive the expression for surface brightness, and then demonstrate its independence from distance.

**Definitions:**
*   **Surface Brightness ($I$):** The observed flux per unit solid angle. It is a measure of how bright an extended object appears per unit angular area.
*   **Surface Magnitude ($\mu$):** The magnitude equivalent of surface brightness, typically measured in $mag/arcmin^2$ or $mag/arcsec^2$.

**Assumptions:**
1.  **Non-expanding universe:** This is explicitly stated in the problem and means we don't need to account for redshift effects (energy loss, time dilation) or cosmological distance measures. Euclidean geometry and the simple inverse-square law apply.
2.  **Isotropic emission:** The galaxy emits light uniformly in all directions.
3.  **Transparent medium:** There is no extinction or absorption of light between the galaxy and the observer.

---

### Derivation Steps:

**1. Define Surface Brightness:**
Surface brightness ($I$) is defined as the total observed flux ($F$) from a galaxy divided by the solid angle ($\Omega$) it subtends in the sky:
$$I = \frac{F}{\Omega} \quad (1)$$

**2. Express Observed Flux ($F$):**
Consider a galaxy with an intrinsic total luminosity $L$ (total power emitted). If this galaxy is at a distance $d$ from the observer in a non-expanding universe, the observed flux $F$ (power received per unit area) is given by the inverse-square law:
$$F = \frac{L}{4 \pi d^2} \quad (2)$$
Here, $4\pi d^2$ represents the surface area of a sphere centered on the galaxy at distance $d$.

**3. Express Solid Angle ($\Omega$):**
Let $A_{physical}$ be the projected physical area of the galaxy on the sky (e.g., if it's a disk, its area $\pi R^2$, where $R$ is its physical radius). The solid angle $\Omega$ (in steradians) subtended by this galaxy at a distance $d$ is given by:
$$\Omega = \frac{A_{physical}}{d^2} \quad (3)$$
This formula is valid for small angles, which is always the case for distant galaxies.

**4. Substitute and Simplify for Surface Brightness ($I$):**
Now, substitute the expressions for $F$ (from equation 2) and $\Omega$ (from equation 3) into the definition of surface brightness (equation 1):
$$I = \frac{\frac{L}{4 \pi d^2}}{\frac{A_{physical}}{d^2}}$$
$$I = \frac{L}{4 \pi d^2} \times \frac{d^2}{A_{physical}}$$
$$I = \frac{L}{4 \pi A_{physical}} \quad (4)$$

**5. Show Independence from Distance:**
From equation (4), we can clearly see that the distance $d$ to the galaxy has cancelled out. The surface brightness $I$ depends only on the galaxy's intrinsic luminosity ($L$) and its intrinsic projected physical area ($A_{physical}$). Both $L$ and $A_{physical}$ are inherent properties of the galaxy itself and do not change with the observer's distance.

Therefore, in a non-expanding universe, the surface brightness of a galaxy is independent of its distance.

**6. Relate to Surface Magnitude ($\mu$):**
Surface magnitude ($\mu$) is related to surface brightness ($I$) by a logarithmic scale, similar to how apparent magnitude is related to flux:
$$\mu = C - 2.5 \log_{10}(I)$$
where $C$ is a constant that depends on the units chosen for $I$ (e.g., $mag/arcmin^2$).

Since the surface brightness $I$ is independent of the distance $d$, its logarithm $\log_{10}(I)$ must also be independent of $d$. Consequently, the surface magnitude $\mu$ is also independent of the distance to the galaxy.

### Conclusion:

In a non-expanding universe, the surface brightness and therefore the surface magnitude of a galaxy are determined solely by its intrinsic properties – its total luminosity and its physical size. The apparent ""dimness"" of Andromeda, despite its relatively bright total apparent magnitude, arises because its light is spread over a very large angular area, meaning its *surface* brightness (brightness per unit solid angle) is relatively low, making it difficult to discern against the background sky. The fact that surface brightness doesn't diminish with distance is a fundamental property in such a universe, contrasting with an expanding universe where cosmological effects cause surface brightness to decrease with increasing distance (e.g., by a factor of $(1+z)^{-4}$).",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"Kepler's Laws, which describe the motion of planets around the Sun, were empirical laws derived from extensive astronomical observations by Tycho Brahe and analyzed by Johannes Kepler. Decades later, Isaac Newton provided the theoretical foundation for these laws by demonstrating that they are direct consequences of his Law of Universal Gravitation and Laws of Motion.

Let's derive each of Kepler's Laws from Newton's principles.

**Assumptions:**
1.  **Two-body problem:** We consider a system of two bodies, a central body (e.g., the Sun) with mass $M$, and an orbiting body (e.g., a planet) with mass $m$.
2.  **Central Force:** The gravitational force acts purely along the line connecting the two bodies.
3.  **Reduced Mass:** For accuracy, we use the concept of reduced mass $\mu = \frac{Mm}{M+m}$, which allows us to treat the two-body problem as an equivalent one-body problem where a particle of mass $\mu$ orbits the center of mass.
4.  **Polar Coordinates:** We will use polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ to describe the position of the orbiting body relative to the central body (which we assume to be at the origin).

**Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:**
The force exerted by the central body $M$ on the orbiting body $m$ is:
$\mathbf{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}$
where:
*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.
*   $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies.
*   $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing from $M$ to $m$. The negative sign indicates an attractive force.

**Newton's Second Law of Motion:**
The force acting on the reduced mass $\mu$ is related to its acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ by:
$\mathbf{F} = \mu\mathbf{a}$

Combining these, the equation of motion for the orbiting body is:
$\mu\mathbf{a} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}$

### **Conservation of Angular Momentum and Planar Motion**

Before deriving the specific laws, let's establish a crucial property of central forces: the conservation of angular momentum.
The torque $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ acting on the orbiting body about the central body is given by:
$\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}$
Since $\mathbf{F}$ is always directed along $\mathbf{r}$ (or opposite to it), the cross product $\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}$ is zero.
$\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \left(-\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right) = \mathbf{0}$
According to Newton's second law for rotation, $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is the angular momentum.
Since $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{0}$, it implies that $\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{0}$, which means the angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ is a constant vector.
Since $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}$ (where $\mathbf{p}=\mu\mathbf{v}$ is the linear momentum), $\mathbf{L}$ is always perpendicular to both the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ and the velocity vector $\mathbf{v}$. For $\mathbf{L}$ to be constant, the plane containing $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ (and thus the motion itself) must remain fixed in space. Therefore, the motion of the orbiting body is confined to a single plane.

### **1. Derivation of Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Areas**

**Statement:** A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

**Derivation:**
In polar coordinates, the position vector is $\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and the velocity vector is $\mathbf{v} = \dot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}} + r\dot{\theta}\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$.
The angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ of the orbiting body with reduced mass $\mu$ is:
$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mu (\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v})$
$\mathbf{L} = \mu (r\hat{\mathbf{r}}) \times (\dot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}} + r\dot{\theta}\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})$
$\mathbf{L} = \mu (r\dot{r}(\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}}) + r^2\dot{\theta}(\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}))$
Since $\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{0}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}}$ (a unit vector perpendicular to the orbital plane), we get:
$\mathbf{L} = \mu r^2\dot{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{k}}$
The magnitude of the angular momentum is $L = \mu r^2\dot{\theta}$.
As established earlier, for a central force, $L$ is constant.

Now, consider the area swept by the radius vector $\mathbf{r}$. In a small time interval $dt$, the radius vector sweeps out a small area $dA$. This area can be approximated as a triangle with sides $\mathbf{r}$ and $d\mathbf{r}$.
$dA = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{r} \times d\mathbf{r}|$
Since $d\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v} dt$, we have:
$dA = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}| dt$
The rate at which area is swept out is:
$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}|$
From the angular momentum magnitude, $L = \mu |\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}|$, so $|\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}| = \frac{L}{\mu}$.
Therefore, substituting this into the area rate equation:
$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2\mu}$

Since $L$ is constant (conservation of angular momentum) and $\mu$ is constant, $\frac{dA}{dt}$ is also a constant. This means that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is Kepler's Second Law.

### **2. Derivation of Kepler's First Law: The Law of Orbits**

**Statement:** The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.

**Derivation:**
We need to find the equation of the orbit, $r(\theta)$. We start with Newton's second law in polar coordinates. The radial component of the force is $F_r = \mu (\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2)$, and the tangential component is $F_\theta = \mu (r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta})$.
For a central force, $F_\theta = 0$. This leads to $\mu \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{dt}(r^2\dot{\theta}) = 0$, implying $r^2\dot{\theta} = \text{constant}$. This constant is $L/\mu$, consistent with our previous finding.
So, $\dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{\mu r^2}$.

The radial equation of motion is:
$\mu (\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2) = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}$

To solve this, we often use the substitution $u = 1/r$.
First, let's express $\dot{r}$ and $\ddot{r}$ in terms of $u$ and $\theta$:
$\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta}\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta}\dot{\theta}$
Since $r = 1/u$, $\frac{dr}{d\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2}\frac{du}{d\theta}$.
And $\dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{\mu r^2} = \frac{L}{\mu}u^2$.
So, $\dot{r} = \left(-\frac{1}{u^2}\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\left(\frac{L}{\mu}u^2\right) = -\frac{L}{\mu}\frac{du}{d\theta}$.

Now for $\ddot{r}$:
$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(-\frac{L}{\mu}\frac{du}{d\theta}\right) = -\frac{L}{\mu}\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\frac{L}{\mu}\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2}\left(\frac{L}{\mu}u^2\right) = -\left(\frac{L}{\mu}\right)^2 u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2}$.

Substitute these into the radial equation of motion:
$\mu \left( -\left(\frac{L}{\mu}\right)^2 u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} - \frac{1}{u}\left(\frac{L}{\mu}u^2\right)^2 \right) = -GMm u^2$
$\mu \left( -\frac{L^2}{\mu^2} u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} - \frac{L^2}{\mu^2} u^3 \right) = -GMm u^2$
Divide by $\mu u^2$ and rearrange:
$-\frac{L^2}{\mu^2} \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} - \frac{L^2}{\mu^2} u = -GMm$
$\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GMm\mu}{L^2}$

This is the differential equation for the orbit. It's a second-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation.
The general solution for $u(\theta)$ is the sum of a particular solution and the solution to the homogeneous equation ($\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = 0$).
A particular solution is $u_p = \frac{GMm\mu}{L^2}$.
The homogeneous solution is $u_c = A\cos(\theta - \theta_0)$, where $A$ and $\theta_0$ are constants determined by initial conditions. By choosing the orientation of our coordinate system such that $\theta_0 = 0$ (meaning the periapsis is at $\theta=0$), we get $u_c = A\cos\theta$.
So, the full solution is:
$u(\theta) = \frac{GMm\mu}{L^2} + A\cos\theta$
Substituting back $u = 1/r$:
$\frac{1}{r} = \frac{GMm\mu}{L^2} \left(1 + \frac{A L^2}{GMm\mu}\cos\theta\right)$

This equation has the standard form of a conic section in polar coordinates:
$\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{l}(1 + e\cos\theta)$
where:
*   $l = \frac{L^2}{GMm\mu}$ is the semi-latus rectum.
*   $e = \frac{A L^2}{GMm\mu}$ is the eccentricity.

The type of conic section depends on the eccentricity $e$:
*   $e = 0$: Circle
*   $0 < e < 1$: Ellipse
*   $e = 1$: Parabola
*   $e > 1$: Hyperbola

The eccentricity $e$ is related to the total mechanical energy $E$ of the system:
$E = \frac{1}{2}\mu v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}$
It can be shown that $e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2EL^2}{\mu(GMm)^2}}$.

For planets orbiting the Sun, the system is bound, meaning the total energy $E$ is negative ($E < 0$).
If $E < 0$, then $1 + \frac{2EL^2}{\mu(GMm)^2} < 1$. This implies $0 \le e < 1$.
Therefore, the orbits of planets are ellipses, with the Sun (the source of the gravitational force) located at one of the foci. This is Kepler's First Law. (A circular orbit is a special case of an ellipse where $e=0$.)

### **3. Derivation of Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Periods**

**Statement:** The square of the orbital period ($T$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$) of its orbit ($T^2 \propto a^3$).

**Derivation:**
From Kepler's Second Law, we know that the rate of area swept out is constant:
$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2\mu}$
The total area $A$ swept out during one orbital period $T$ is the area of the ellipse itself.
For an ellipse, the area is $A = \pi ab$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.
Thus, $A = \int_0^T \frac{dA}{dt} dt = \frac{L}{2\mu} T$.
Equating the two expressions for the area:
$\pi ab = \frac{L}{2\mu} T$
Solving for the period $T$:
$T = \frac{2\pi ab\mu}{L}$
Squaring both sides:
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2 \mu^2}{L^2}$

Now we need to relate $b$ to $a$ and the constants from the first law derivation.
From the equation of the ellipse in polar coordinates, we found the semi-latus rectum $l = \frac{L^2}{GMm\mu}$.
For an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum is also related to the semi-major and semi-minor axes by $l = \frac{b^2}{a}$.
Equating these two expressions for $l$:
$\frac{b^2}{a} = \frac{L^2}{GMm\mu}$
Solving for $b^2$:
$b^2 = \frac{L^2 a}{GMm\mu}$

Substitute this expression for $b^2$ back into the equation for $T^2$:
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 \mu^2}{L^2} \left(\frac{L^2 a}{GMm\mu}\right)$
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3 \mu^2}{GMm\mu}$
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 \mu}{GMm} a^3$

Finally, substitute the definition of the reduced mass $\mu = \frac{Mm}{M+m}$:
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 \left(\frac{Mm}{M+m}\right)}{GMm} a^3$
$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M+m)} a^3$

This is the generalized form of Kepler's Third Law.
In the common case where the mass of the central body $M$ is much greater than the mass of the orbiting body $m$ (i.e., $M \gg m$, so $M+m \approx M$), the formula simplifies to:
$T^2 \approx \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3$

Since $4\pi^2$, $G$, and $M$ (for a given central body like the Sun) are all constants, the term $\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}$ is a constant.
Thus, $T^2 \propto a^3$, which is Kepler's Third Law.

---

**Conclusion:**
We have successfully derived all three of Kepler's Laws from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton's Laws of Motion.
*   **Kepler's Second Law** arises from the conservation of angular momentum inherent in a central force.
*   **Kepler's First Law** results from solving the differential equation of motion for an inverse-square force, which naturally yields the equation of a conic section (an ellipse for bound orbits).
*   **Kepler's Third Law** is obtained by combining the constant rate of area sweeping with the geometrical properties of an ellipse and the parameters derived from the orbit equation.

These derivations demonstrate the profound connection between Newton's fundamental laws of physics and the observed celestial mechanics described by Kepler.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude:

We will use the given definitions and Oort's approximations.

First, let's establish the relationship between the radial gradient of rotational velocity and Oort's constants, which will be applicable to Case (I).

### Derivation of Oort's Constants A and B

We are given the line-of-sight velocity $V_r$ and transverse velocity $V_t$ components:
1.  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
2.  $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

And Oort's first-order approximations in the solar neighborhood ($D \ll R_0$):
3.  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$
4.  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

Let's expand $\Omega(R)$ around $R_0$ using a Taylor series:
$\Omega(R) = \Omega_0 + \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} (R - R_0) + \mathcal{O}((R-R_0)^2)$
For a first-order approximation, we have:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} (R - R_0)$

From the geometry of the Sun-GC-HI cloud triangle, using the law of cosines:
$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2R_0D \cos l$
For $D \ll R_0$, we can approximate $R$:
$R = R_0 \sqrt{1 + \frac{D^2}{R_0^2} - 2\frac{D}{R_0} \cos l} \approx R_0 \left(1 - \frac{D}{R_0} \cos l + \frac{D^2}{2R_0^2} \sin^2 l\right)$
To first order in $D$:
$R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l$.

Substitute this into the expression for $\Omega - \Omega_0$:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} (-D \cos l)$

Now, substitute this into the expression for $V_r$ (Eq. 1):
$V_r \approx \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} (-D \cos l) R_0 \sin l$
$V_r \approx - R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \sin l \cos l$
Using the identity $\sin(2l) = 2 \sin l \cos l$:
$V_r \approx - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \sin(2l)$

Comparing this with Oort's approximation for $V_r$ (Eq. 3):
$AD \sin(2l) = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \sin(2l)$
So, Oort's constant $A$ is:
$A = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0}$ (Eq. 5)

Next, substitute the approximation for $\Omega - \Omega_0$ into the expression for $V_t$ (Eq. 2), keeping only first-order terms in $D$:
$V_t \approx \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} (-D \cos l) R_0 \cos l - \Omega_0 D$ (We approximate $\Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D$ for first order in $D$)
$V_t \approx - R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D$
Using the identity $\cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos(2l)}{2}$:
$V_t \approx - R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \left(\frac{1 + \cos(2l)}{2}\right) - \Omega_0 D$
$V_t \approx - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \cos(2l) - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D - \Omega_0 D$

Comparing this with Oort's approximation for $V_t$ (Eq. 4):
$AD \cos(2l) + BD = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} D \cos(2l) + \left(- \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} - \Omega_0\right) D$
From the $\cos(2l)$ term, we again find $A = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0}$, confirming Eq. 5.
From the $D$ term, Oort's constant $B$ is:
$B = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} - \Omega_0$
Substitute $A$ (Eq. 5) into the expression for $B$:
$B = A - \Omega_0$ (Eq. 6)

From Eq. 6, we can express $\Omega_0$ as:
$\Omega_0 = A - B$ (Eq. 7)

### Deriving the Radial Gradient of Rotational Velocity

The rotational velocity $V$ is related to the angular velocity $\Omega$ by $V = \Omega R$.
We want to find $\frac{dV}{dR}$ at $R = R_0$. Differentiating $V = \Omega R$ with respect to $R$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}(\Omega R) = \Omega \frac{dR}{dR} + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \Omega + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}$
Evaluating this at $R = R_0$:
$\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0}$

From Eq. 5, we have $R_0 \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right)_{R_0} = -2A$.
Substitute this into the expression for $\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R_0}$:
$\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R_0} = \Omega_0 - 2A$

Now, substitute $\Omega_0 = A - B$ (Eq. 7) into this expression:
$\left(\frac{dV}{dR}\right)_{R_0} = (A - B) - 2A = -A - B = -(A+B)$

This is the general expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity in terms of Oort's constants.

### Case (I): The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy

For the actual observed rotation curve, the derived relationship holds directly.
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -(A+B)$

---

### Case (II): Hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

In this scenario, the rotational velocity $V$ is determined by the gravitational pull of a central point mass $M_{GC}$. The centripetal force equals the gravitational force:
$\frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{GM_{GC}}{R^2}$
$V^2 = \frac{GM_{GC}}{R}$
So, $V(R) = \sqrt{GM_{GC}} R^{-1/2}$.

Now, we calculate the radial gradient $\frac{dV}{dR}$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{GM_{GC}} R^{-1/2} \right)$
$\frac{dV}{dR} = \sqrt{GM_{GC}} \left( -\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2} \right)$
$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sqrt{GM_{GC}}}{R^{3/2}}$

We can express $\sqrt{GM_{GC}}$ in terms of $V(R)$ from $V(R) = \sqrt{GM_{GC}} R^{-1/2}$, so $\sqrt{GM_{GC}} = V(R) R^{1/2}$.
Substituting this back into the derivative:
$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R) R^{1/2}}{R^{3/2}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}$

Now, we evaluate this at the Sun's location, $R = R_0$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$

Since $V_0 = \Omega_0 R_0$, we can also write this as:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0$

Finally, we express this in terms of Oort's constants using $\Omega_0 = A - B$ (Eq. 7):
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\frac{1}{2} (A - B)$

---

### Summary of Results:

**For Case (I): The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy:**
The radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -(A+B)$

**For Case (II): The rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre:**

20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"To derive Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_0$, $R_0$, and $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$, we will follow these steps:
1.  Establish the geometrical relationship between $R$, $R_0$, $D$, and $l$.
2.  Use the solar neighborhood approximation ($D \ll R_0$) to expand $R$ and $\Omega(R)$ in a Taylor series.
3.  Substitute these approximations into the given expressions for $V_r$ and $V_t$.
4.  Compare the resulting expressions with Oort's approximations to identify $A$ and $B$.
5.  Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of the required parameters.

**Step 1: Geometrical Relationship**
Consider the triangle formed by the Galactic Centre (GC), the Sun (S), and the HI cloud (C). Let the distances be $R_0$ (GC-S), $R$ (GC-C), and $D$ (S-C). The Galactic longitude $l$ is the angle at the Sun between the line of sight to the cloud (S-C) and the line from the Sun to the Galactic Centre (S-GC). Using the Law of Cosines on this triangle for side $R$:
$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2R_0D\cos(\angle GCS)$
This is not correct. The angle opposite to $R$ is $l'$ at the Sun, not $l$.
Let's use the standard setup where $l$ is the angle between the Sun-GC line and the Sun-cloud line.
The angle at the Sun, between the direction *towards* the GC and the line of sight to the cloud, is $l$.
If we consider the angle at the Sun between the line segment $S \rightarrow GC$ and $S \rightarrow C$, this angle is $l$. This is what is meant by $l$ in most contexts and for the given $V_r$ formula.
So, using the Law of Cosines for side $R$:
$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2R_0D\cos(\pi-l)$
$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 + 2R_0D\cos l$

**Step 2: Solar Neighborhood Approximation ($D \ll R_0$)**
For a cloud in the solar neighborhood, $D \ll R_0$. We can approximate $R$:
$R = \sqrt{R_0^2 + 2R_0D\cos l + D^2} = R_0 \sqrt{1 + \frac{2D\cos l}{R_0} + \frac{D^2}{R_0^2}}$
Since $D/R_0$ is small, we use the binomial approximation $(1+x)^p \approx 1+px$ for small $x$. We can ignore the $D^2/R_0^2$ term for a first-order approximation in $D$:
$R \approx R_0 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{2D\cos l}{R_0}\right) = R_0 (1 + \frac{D\cos l}{R_0})$
$R \approx R_0 + D\cos l$.
So, the radial displacement of the cloud from the Sun's orbit is $\Delta R = R - R_0 \approx D\cos l$.

The angular velocity $\Omega(R)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series around $R_0$:
$\Omega(R) \approx \Omega(R_0) + (R-R_0) \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx (D\cos l) \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$.

**Step 3: Substitute and Compare with Oort's Approximations**
We are given the general expressions for $V_r$ and $V_t$:
$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

Substitute the approximation for $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$ into $V_r$:
$V_r \approx \left(D\cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right) R_0 \sin l$
$V_r \approx R_0 D \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \sin l \cos l$
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin l \cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin(2l)$:
$V_r \approx \frac{1}{2} R_0 D \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \sin(2l)$.

Comparing this with Oort's approximation $V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$, we can identify $A$:
$A = \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$.

Now, substitute the approximations into $V_t$:
$V_t \approx \left(D\cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right) R_0 \cos l - (\Omega_0 + D\cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}) D$.
$V_t \approx R_0 D \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D - D^2\cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$.
Since we are considering a first-order approximation in $D$, we neglect the $D^2$ term:
$V_t \approx R_0 D \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D$.

Substitute $A = \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$, which implies $R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = 2A$:
$V_t \approx 2AD \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D$.
Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2 l = \frac{1+\cos(2l)}{2}$:
$V_t \approx 2AD \left(\frac{1+\cos(2l)}{2}\right) - \Omega_0 D$
$V_t \approx AD(1+\cos(2l)) - \Omega_0 D$
$V_t \approx AD\cos(2l) + AD - \Omega_0 D$
$V_t \approx AD\cos(2l) + (A - \Omega_0) D$.

Comparing this with Oort's approximation $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$, we can identify $B$:
$B = A - \Omega_0$.

**Step 4: Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_0$, $R_0$, and $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$**
We know that angular velocity $\Omega = V/R$. Therefore, $\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0$.
First, let's find the derivative $\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$:
$\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) = \frac{R\frac{dV}{dR} - V\frac{dR}{dR}}{R^2} = \frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}$.
At $R=R_0$:
$\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}$.

Now, substitute this into the expression for $A$:
$A = \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left(\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right)$
$A = \frac{1}{2} \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.

Finally, substitute the expression for $A$ and $\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0$ into the expression for $B$:
$B = A - \Omega_0 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{3}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0}$.

The final expressions for Oort's constants are:

$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\right)}$
$\boxed{B = \frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} - \frac{3}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}}$",0.728

1.  **Recall the total mechanical energy for a circular Keplerian orbit:**
    For a particle of mass $m$ orbiting a central mass $M$ in a circular orbit of radius $r_{orbit}$, its total mechanical energy $E$ is the sum of its kinetic energy ($K$) and gravitational potential energy ($U$).

    *   **Gravitational Potential Energy:** $U = -\frac{G M m}{r_{orbit}}$
    *   **Kinetic Energy:** For a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:
        $\frac{m v^2}{r_{orbit}} = \frac{G M m}{r_{orbit}^2}$
        Solving for $v^2$: $v^2 = \frac{G M}{r_{orbit}}$
        So, $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \left(\frac{G M}{r_{orbit}}\right) = \frac{G M m}{2 r_{orbit}}$

    *   **Total Mechanical Energy:**

    $\frac{E_{initial}}{\Delta m} = -\frac{G M}{2 R_{max}}$

3.  **Calculate the final mechanical energy per unit mass:**
    The gas element eventually reaches an orbit of radius $r$.
    The final total mechanical energy per unit mass is:
    $\frac{E_{final}}{\Delta m} = -\frac{G M}{2 r}$

4.  **Determine the released mechanical energy per unit mass:**
    When the gas accretes from a larger radius ($R_{max}$) to a smaller radius ($r$), its total mechanical energy decreases (becomes more negative). This decrease in energy is the energy *released* by the gas, primarily through viscous dissipation as described in the problem.
    The total mechanical energy per unit mass released, $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$, is the difference between the initial and final energy states:
    $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{E_{initial}}{\Delta m} - \frac{E_{final}}{\Delta m}$
    $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \left(-\frac{G M}{2 R_{max}}\right) - \left(-\frac{G M}{2 r}\right)$
    $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{G M}{2 r} - \frac{G M}{2 R_{max}}$
    $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{G M}{2} \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}}\right)$

5.  **Apply the approximation $r \ll R_{max}$:**
    The problem states that the final radius $r$ is much smaller than the maximum radius $R_{max}$ ($r \ll R_{max}$). This means that $\frac{1}{R_{max}}$ is much smaller than $\frac{1}{r}$. Therefore, we can neglect the term $\frac{1}{R_{max}}$ in the expression:
    $\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}} \approx \frac{1}{r}$

6.  **Final Expression:**
    Substituting this approximation into the released energy expression:
    $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{G M}{2 r}$

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}$.",0.728

25,"A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences.

The universe's expansion is described by $S = s e^{H_0 t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation. We are given the initial distance $D$, the speed of light $c$, and the total round-trip time $T$.

**1. Define the expansion and light propagation:**

Let $t=0$ be the time the laser beam is emitted from Earth.
The initial proper distance to the mirror is $D$.
The problem states the separation $S$ follows $S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}$. Here, $s$ represents the initial separation, which is $D$ at $t=0$. So, the proper distance to the mirror at time $t$ is $D(t) = D e^{H_0 t}$.

To describe light propagation in an expanding universe, we use the concept of comoving distance. Let $r$ be the comoving distance. The proper distance $S(t)$ is related to the comoving distance $r$ by $S(t) = a(t) r$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor. From $S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}$, we can infer that $a(t) = e^{H_0 t}$ (assuming the comoving distance of the mirror is $D$).

For a photon, the relationship between proper time $dt$ and change in comoving distance $dr$ is $c dt = a(t) dr$.

**2. Outward Journey (Earth to Mirror):**

Let $t_1$ be the time the light reaches the mirror. The light travels from a comoving distance of $0$ (Earth) to $D$ (mirror).
So, we integrate:
$\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c}{a(t')} dt' = \int_0^D dr'$
$\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c}{e^{H_0 t'}} dt' = D$
$c \int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t'} dt' = D$
$c \left[ \frac{e^{-H_0 t'}}{-H_0} \right]_0^{t_1} = D$
$\frac{c}{-H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^0) = D$
$\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D \quad (*)$

**3. Inward Journey (Mirror to Earth):**

The light reflects off the mirror at time $t_1$ and returns to Earth at time $T$. It travels from the mirror's comoving distance $D$ back to Earth's comoving distance $0$.
So, we integrate:
$\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c}{a(t')} dt' = \int_0^D dr'$ (The comoving distance covered is still $D$, just in the opposite direction).
$\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c}{e^{H_0 t'}} dt' = D$
$c \left[ \frac{e^{-H_0 t'}}{-H_0} \right]_{t_1}^{T} = D$
$\frac{c}{-H_0} (e^{-H_0 T} - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D$
$\frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}) = D \quad (**)$

**4. Solve for $H_0$:**

We have two expressions for $D$. Equating them:
$\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})$
$1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}$
$1 + e^{-H_0 T} = 2 e^{-H_0 t_1}$
$e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{1 + e^{-H_0 T}}{2}$

Substitute this back into equation $(*)$:
$D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( 1 - \frac{1 + e^{-H_0 T}}{2} \right)$
$D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( \frac{2 - 1 - e^{-H_0 T}}{2} \right)$
$D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( \frac{1 - e^{-H_0 T}}{2} \right)$

Rearranging for $H_0$:
$2 D H_0 = c (1 - e^{-H_0 T})$
$H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} (1 - e^{-H_0 T})$

This is an implicit equation for $H_0$. The problem hints at using the approximation $e^x \approx 1+x$ for $x \ll 1$. Let $x = -H_0 T$.
If we use only the first-order approximation $e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T$:
$H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} (1 - (1 - H_0 T))$
$H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} (H_0 T)$
This simplifies to $1 = \frac{cT}{2D}$, which means $H_0$ cannot be determined (it cancels out, or implies $H_0=0$ if $cT \neq 2D$). This indicates that this approximation is not sufficient to find a non-zero $H_0$.

Therefore, we must use a higher-order approximation for $e^x$. The next order is $e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2}$.
For $x = -H_0 T$:
$e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(-H_0 T)^2}{2} = 1 - H_0 T + \frac{1}{2} (H_0 T)^2$

Substitute this into the equation for $H_0$:
$H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} \left( 1 - \left( 1 - H_0 T + \frac{1}{2} (H_0 T)^2 \right) \right)$
$H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} \left( H_0 T - \frac{1}{2} (H_0 T)^2 \right)$

Assuming $H_0 \ne 0$ (which it must be for a non-static universe that has an expansion to be measured), we can divide both sides by $H_0$:
$1 = \frac{c}{2D} \left( T - \frac{1}{2} H_0 T^2 \right)$
$1 = \frac{cT}{2D} - \frac{c H_0 T^2}{4D}$

Now, we can solve for $H_0$:
$\frac{c H_0 T^2}{4D} = \frac{cT}{2D} - 1$
$H_0 = \frac{4D}{c T^2} \left( \frac{cT}{2D} - 1 \right)$
$H_0 = \frac{4D}{c T^2} \left( \frac{cT - 2D}{2D} \right)$
$H_0 = \frac{2 (cT - 2D)}{c T^2}$
$H_0 = \frac{2cT}{cT^2} - \frac{4D}{cT^2}$
$H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}$

This expression for $H_0$ is valid under the approximation $H_0 T \ll 1$.

The final answer is $\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}$.",0.728

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"The task is to determine the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity ($L_{GW}$) of a binary neutron star system using dimensional analysis and given constraints.

**1. Identify the physical quantities and their dimensions:**

*   **Gravitational Wave Luminosity ($L_{GW}$):** This is a power, so its dimensions are:
    $[L_{GW}] = [\text{Energy}]/[\text{Time}] = [M L^2 T^{-3}]$
*   **Gravitational Constant ($G$):**
    $[G] = [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]$
*   **Speed of Light ($c$):**
    $[c] = [L T^{-1}]$
*   **Mass of one neutron star ($M$):**
    $[M] = [M]$
*   **Orbital radius around the center of mass ($R$):**
    $[R] = [L]$
*   **Dimensionless constant:** The problem states it's $\frac{2}{5}$, which has no dimensions.

**2. Set up the general expression:**

We are told that $L_{GW}$ can be expressed as a single term involving these quantities and a dimensionless constant. Let's assume the expression is of the form:
$L_{GW} = \text{Constant} \cdot G^a c^b M^d R^e$

Substituting the dimensionless constant $\frac{2}{5}$:
$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^a c^b M^d R^e$

**3. Perform dimensional analysis:**

Equate the dimensions of both sides of the equation:
$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]^a [L T^{-1}]^b [M]^d [L]^e$

Combine the powers for each fundamental dimension ($M$, $L$, $T$):
$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = [M^{-a+d} L^{3a+b+e} T^{-2a-b}]$

**4. Equate the exponents for each dimension:**

This gives us a system of linear equations for the exponents $a, b, d, e$:

*   For $[M]$: $1 = -a + d$  (Equation 1)
*   For $[L]$: $2 = 3a + b + e$ (Equation 2)
*   For $[T]$: $-3 = -2a - b$ (Equation 3)

**5. Apply the additional constraint:**

The problem states: ""Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power.""
This means:
$b = e$ (Equation 4)

**6. Solve the system of equations:**

*   From Equation 1, we can express $d$ in terms of $a$:
    $d = 1 + a$

*   From Equation 3, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:
    $b = 3 - 2a$

*   Using Equation 4, since $b=e$:
    $e = 3 - 2a$

*   Now substitute the expressions for $b$ and $e$ into Equation 2:
    $2 = 3a + (3 - 2a) + (3 - 2a)$
    $2 = 3a + 3 - 2a + 3 - 2a$
    $2 = (3a - 2a - 2a) + (3 + 3)$
    $2 = -a + 6$
    $a = 6 - 2$
    $a = 4$

*   Now that we have $a$, we can find $d, b, e$:
    $d = 1 + a = 1 + 4 = 5$
    $b = 3 - 2a = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5$
    $e = b = -5$

**7. Write the final expression for $L_{GW}$:**

Substitute the determined exponents ($a=4, b=-5, d=5, e=-5$) and the dimensionless constant ($\frac{2}{5}$) into the general form:

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}$

This can be written in a more conventional form by placing terms with negative exponents in the denominator:

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}$

This expression satisfies all the given conditions: it includes the specified dimensionless constant, $G, c, M, R$, and $c$ and $R$ are indeed raised to the same power ($-5$).

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"To find the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, we need to relate the rate of change of the system's total orbital energy to the energy radiated away by gravitational waves.

**1. Calculate the Total Orbital Energy (E) of the Binary System**

The system consists of two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each, orbiting in a circular path. The problem states that $R$ is the radius of the circular orbit, which typically refers to the separation between the two stars in such a symmetric system. Thus, each star orbits around the center of mass at a radius $r = R/2$.

*   **Kinetic Energy (K):**
    For each star, the kinetic energy is $K_1 = \frac{1}{2} M v^2$, where $v$ is the orbital speed of each star.
    The total kinetic energy of the system is $K_{total} = 2 \times K_1 = M v^2$.

*   **Gravitational Potential Energy (U):**
    The gravitational potential energy between the two stars separated by a distance $R$ is $U = -\frac{G M M}{R} = -\frac{G M^2}{R}$.

*   **Orbital Velocity (v):**
    For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force between the stars provides the centripetal force for each star orbiting its center of mass.
    The gravitational force between the two stars is $F_g = \frac{G M^2}{R^2}$.
    The centripetal force required for one star orbiting at radius $r = R/2$ is $F_c = M \frac{v^2}{r} = M \frac{v^2}{R/2} = \frac{2 M v^2}{R}$.
    Equating these forces:
    $\frac{2 M v^2}{R} = \frac{G M^2}{R^2}$
    $2 v^2 = \frac{G M}{R}$
    $v^2 = \frac{G M}{2R}$

*   **Substitute $v^2$ into $K_{total}$:**
    $K_{total} = M \left(\frac{G M}{2R}\right) = \frac{G M^2}{2R}$.

*   **Total Energy (E):**
    The total orbital energy is the sum of the total kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy:
    $E = K_{total} + U = \frac{G M^2}{2R} - \frac{G M^2}{R} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}$.

**2. Relate Energy Loss to Gravitational Wave Luminosity**

The system loses energy due to gravitational wave emission. The rate of change of the total orbital energy, $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$, is equal to the negative of the gravitational wave luminosity, $L_{GW}$ (since energy is being radiated away):
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$.

**3. Differentiate E with Respect to Time (t)**

We have $E = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}$. We need to find $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$.
Since $G$ and $M$ are constants, we can rewrite $E$ as $E = -\frac{G M^2}{2} R^{-1}$.
Using the chain rule (as hinted, $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$):
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left(-\frac{G M^2}{2} R^{-1}\right)$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{G M^2}{2} \left( (-1) R^{-1-1} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{G M^2}{2} \left( -R^{-2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$.

**4. Equate and Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$**

Now, we set the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$ equal to $-L_{GW}$:
$\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$.

Substitute the given expression for $L_{GW}$: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.
$\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.

Finally, solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \times \frac{2R^2}{G M^2}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4 G^4 M^5 R^2}{5 G M^2 R^5 c^5}$.

Simplify the powers of $G$, $M$, and $R$:
$G^{4-1} = G^3$
$M^{5-2} = M^3$
$R^{2-5} = R^{-3}$

Thus, the final expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is:
$\boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4 G^3 M^3}{5 R^3 c^5}}$.",0.49
