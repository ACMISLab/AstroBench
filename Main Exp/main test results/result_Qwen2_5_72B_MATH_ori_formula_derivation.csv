Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

Likewise, the planet is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the Sun

$F_{P} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{2}} \frac{-r}{|r|} = -k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{3}} r$

From Newton’s second law: both the Sun and the planet accelerate under the action of force

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"To derive the virial theorem, we start with Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on a particle is equal to the mass of the particle times its acceleration. For a system of \( N \) particles, the force on the \( i \)-th particle is given by \( \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i \), where \( m_i \) is the mass of the \( i \)-th particle, \( \mathbf{a}_i \) is its acceleration, and \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the resultant force acting on it.

The virial \( G \) is defined as the sum of the dot products of the position vector of each particle with the force acting on it:
\[
G = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]
Using Newton's second law, we can substitute \( \mathbf{F}_i \) with \( m_i \mathbf{a}_i \):
\[
G = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot m_i \mathbf{a}_i
\]
The acceleration \( \mathbf{a}_i \) is the second derivative of the position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \) with respect to time, so we can write:
\[
\mathbf{a}_i = \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \( G \), we get:
\[
G = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
\]
To find the time derivative of \( G \), we use the product rule:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left( \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^3 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^3} \right)
\]
The first term inside the sum can be simplified using the identity \( \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} v_i^2 \right) = \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i \), where \( \mathbf{v}_i = \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \) is the velocity of the \( i \)-th particle:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left( \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} v_i^2 \right) + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^3 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^3} \right)
\]
The second term inside the sum is the time derivative of the virial itself, so we can write:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} v_i^2 \right) + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} \right)
\]
The first term is the time derivative of the kinetic energy \( T \) of the system:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 2T \right) + \frac{d}{dt} \left( G \right)
\]
Integrating both sides with respect to time, we get:
\[
G = 2T + \text{constant}
\]
For a system in a steady state, the virial \( G \) is constant, so the time average of \( G \) is equal to \( G \):
\[
\langle G \rangle = 2 \langle T \rangle
\]
The virial theorem states that the time average of the virial is equal to the negative of the time average of the potential energy \( U \):
\[
\langle G \rangle = -2 \langle U \rangle
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
2 \langle T \rangle = -2 \langle U \rangle
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\langle T \rangle = -\langle U \rangle
\]
This is the virial theorem. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\langle T \rangle = -\langle U \rangle}

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

\[ m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N. \]

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
First, we sum the equations of motion for all \( N \) bodies:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right). \]

Notice that the right-hand side is a sum of all pairwise forces, and each force \(\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)\) is equal and opposite to \(\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}\right) = \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)\). Therefore, the right-hand side sums to zero:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \mathbf{0}. \]

This implies that the total momentum \(\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\) is conserved:

\[ \frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \mathbf{0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}. \]

### Step 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum
Next, we take the cross product of the equation of motion for each body with \(\mathbf{r}_i\):

\[ \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right). \]

The right-hand side simplifies because \(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{0}\):

\[ \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j. \]

Summing over all \( N \) bodies, we get:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j. \]

Notice that each term \(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\) is canceled by \(\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\), so the right-hand side sums to zero:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \mathbf{0}. \]

This implies that the total angular momentum \(\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\) is conserved:

\[ \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}. \]

### Step 3: Conservation of Energy
Finally, we take the dot product of the equation of motion for each body with \(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\):

\[ m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}. \]

The left-hand side is:

\[ m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} v_{i}^2 \right). \]

The right-hand side can be rewritten using the chain rule:

\[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right). \]

Summing over all \( N \) bodies, we get:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} v_{i}^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right). \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} v_{i}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{2 \left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right) = 0. \]

This implies that the total energy \( E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} v_{i}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{2 \left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \) is conserved:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = \text{constant}. \]

Thus, the first integrals of motion for an N-body system are the conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy:

\[ \boxed{\mathbf{P} = \text{constant}, \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}, \quad E = \text{constant}}. \]",0.714

Equation (i): For an elliptical orbit, when $f=0$ (periapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its minimum value: $r_{P}=\frac{p}{1+e}=a(1-e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"To prove the given formulas for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion of a celestial body in elliptical motion, we will use the principles of conservation of angular momentum and the vis-viva equation.

### Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum
The angular momentum \( L \) of a celestial body orbiting a central body is conserved. The angular momentum can be expressed as:
\[ L = m r v \]
where \( m \) is the mass of the orbiting body, \( r \) is the radial distance from the central body, and \( v \) is the velocity of the orbiting body.

At perihelion (the closest point to the central body), the distance is \( r_P = a(1 - e) \) and the velocity is \( v_P \). At aphelion (the farthest point from the central body), the distance is \( r_A = a(1 + e) \) and the velocity is \( v_A \). Since angular momentum is conserved, we have:
\[ m r_P v_P = m r_A v_A \]
\[ r_P v_P = r_A v_A \]
\[ a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \]
\[ v_P = v_A \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \]

### Step 2: Vis-viva Equation
The vis-viva equation relates the velocity of an orbiting body to its distance from the central body and the parameters of the orbit. The vis-viva equation is:
\[ v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
where \( \mu \) is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body, \( r \) is the radial distance, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

#### Perihelion Velocity
At perihelion, \( r = r_P = a(1 - e) \). Substituting into the vis-viva equation, we get:
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{a(1 - e)} \right) \]
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{1 + e}{a(1 - e)} \right) \]
\[ v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}} \]

#### Aphelion Velocity
At aphelion, \( r = r_A = a(1 + e) \). Substituting into the vis-viva equation, we get:
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{a(1 + e)} \right) \]
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{1 - e}{a(1 + e)} \right) \]
\[ v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} \]

Thus, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are:
\[ v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} \]
\[ v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}} \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}}

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"To find the expression that relates the period \( P \) of the satellite with its distance \( d \) to the center of the planet, we need to use the principles of gravitational force and circular motion. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the mass of the planet inside the satellite's orbit:**
   The planet is cylindrical with radius \( R \) and density \( \rho \). The mass \( M \) of the planet inside the satellite's orbit (which is a cylinder of radius \( d \) if \( d \leq R \) or the entire planet if \( d > R \)) is given by:
   - If \( d \leq R \):
     \[
     M = \pi d^2 L \rho
     \]
   - If \( d > R \):
     \[
     M = \pi R^2 L \rho
     \]
   where \( L \) is the length of the cylindrical planet. Since the length \( L \) will cancel out in the final expression, we can focus on the mass per unit length.

2. **Gravitational force on the satellite:**
   The gravitational force \( F \) between the satellite and the planet is given by:
   \[
   F = \frac{G M m}{d^2}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m \) is the mass of the satellite, and \( d \) is the distance from the satellite to the center of the planet.

3. **Centripetal force for circular motion:**
   The satellite is in circular motion with period \( P \), so the centripetal force \( F_c \) is:
   \[
   F_c = m \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   For the satellite to be in a stable orbit, the gravitational force must equal the centripetal force:
   \[
   \frac{G M m}{d^2} = m \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{G M}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   \[
   G M P^2 = 4 \pi^2 d^3
   \]
   \[
   P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 d^3}{G M}
   \]

4. **Substitute the mass \( M \):**
   - If \( d \leq R \):
     \[
     M = \pi d^2 L \rho
     \]
     \[
     P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 d^3}{G \pi d^2 L \rho} = \frac{4 \pi d}{G L \rho}
     \]
     Since \( L \) is the length of the planet and does not affect the period for a given density and radius, we can simplify to:
     \[
     P^2 = \frac{4 \pi d}{G \rho}
     \]
     \[
     P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d}{G \rho}}
     \]
   - If \( d > R \):
     \[
     M = \pi R^2 L \rho
     \]
     \[
     P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 d^3}{G \pi R^2 L \rho} = \frac{4 \pi d^3}{G R^2 L \rho}
     \]
     Again, since \( L \) does not affect the period for a given density and radius, we can simplify to:
     \[
     P^2 = \frac{4 \pi d^3}{G R^2 \rho}
     \]
     \[
     P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d^3}{G R^2 \rho}}
     \]

Therefore, the expression that relates the period \( P \) of the satellite with its distance \( d \) to the center of the planet is:
\[
\boxed{P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d^3}{G R^2 \rho}}}
\] if \( d > R \), and
\[
\boxed{P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d}{G \rho}}}
\] if \( d \leq R \).",0.637

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"To determine the masses of Galaxies A and B, we need to use the principles of rotational dynamics and the virial theorem, respectively.

### Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy
For Galaxy A, we use the relationship between the rotational velocity and the mass of the galaxy. The rotational velocity \(v\) at a distance \(R\) from the center of a galaxy is given by:
\[ v^2 = \frac{GM_A}{R} \]
where \(M_A\) is the mass of Galaxy A and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Solving for \(M_A\), we get:
\[ M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \]

### Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy
For Galaxy B, we use the virial theorem. The virial theorem states that for a system of particles in equilibrium, the total kinetic energy \(T\) is related to the total potential energy \(V\) by:
\[ 2T = -V \]
For a spherical galaxy with uniform density, the total potential energy \(V\) is given by:
\[ V = -\frac{3GM_B^2}{5R} \]
where \(M_B\) is the mass of Galaxy B. The total kinetic energy \(T\) is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the stars, which can be expressed in terms of the radial velocity dispersion \(\sigma_r\). For a spherical galaxy, the radial velocity dispersion is related to the total kinetic energy by:
\[ T = \frac{3}{2} M_B \sigma_r^2 \]
Since the radial velocity dispersion \(\sigma_r\) is equal to the rotational velocity \(v\) of Galaxy A, we have \(\sigma_r = v\). Therefore, the total kinetic energy \(T\) is:
\[ T = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \]
Using the virial theorem, we substitute \(T\) and \(V\) into the equation \(2T = -V\):
\[ 2 \left( \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \right) = - \left( -\frac{3GM_B^2}{5R} \right) \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ 3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3GM_B^2}{5R} \]
Dividing both sides by \(3 M_B\), we obtain:
\[ v^2 = \frac{GM_B}{5R} \]
Solving for \(M_B\), we get:
\[ M_B = \frac{5v^2 R}{G} \]

### Final Answer
The masses of Galaxies A and B are:
\[ M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \]
\[ M_B = \frac{5v^2 R}{G} \]
Thus, the masses of the galaxies are:
\[ \boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}, \quad M_B = \frac{5v^2 R}{G}} \]",0.637

The gravitational pressure is given by:

\[ p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \]

At equilibrium, the electron degeneracy pressure equals the gravitational pressure:

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5R^3} \]

We can simplify this equation by canceling the common factor \(\frac{5}{5}\):

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{R^3} \]

Next, we need to express the number density \(n\) in terms of the mass density \(\rho\). The number density of electrons \(n\) is the number of electrons per unit volume. Since each nucleus has \(Z\) electrons and the mass of each nucleus is approximately \(Am_p\) (where \(m_p\) is the mass of a proton), the number density of electrons is:

\[ n = \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \]

Substituting \(n\) into the equilibrium equation, we get:

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{R^3} \]

The mass density \(\rho\) is also given by:

\[ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \]

Substituting \(R^3\) in terms of \(\rho\) into the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{\left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)} \]
\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM^2 \rho}{3M} \]
\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM \rho}{3} \]

We can cancel \(\rho\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{2/3} = \frac{4\pi GM}{3} \]

U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right)
\]

We can distribute \(\vec{m}_2\) inside the dot product:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left( \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right) \right)
\]

This can be further expanded as:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left( 3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right)
\]

Thus, the energy of the interaction between the two magnetic dipoles is:

\[
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left( 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right)}

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"To solve the problem, we need to consider the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the proton and use the principles of classical mechanics to find the total energy and the orbital momentum of the electron.

### Step 1: Determine the Orbital Speed of the Electron
The electron orbits the proton due to the Coulombic force, which provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. The Coulombic force between the electron and the proton is given by:
\[ F = \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \]
where \( k \) is the Coulomb constant, \( e \) is the electric charge, and \( r \) is the radius of the orbit.

The centripetal force required for circular motion is:
\[ F = m_e \frac{v^2}{r} \]
where \( m_e \) is the mass of the electron and \( v \) is the orbital speed.

Equating the Coulombic force to the centripetal force, we get:
\[ \frac{k e^2}{r^2} = m_e \frac{v^2}{r} \]
Solving for \( v^2 \), we find:
\[ v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Energy of the Electron
The total energy \( E \) of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy and its potential energy. The kinetic energy \( K \) is:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_e \left( \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \right) = \frac{k e^2}{2r} \]
The potential energy \( U \) due to the Coulombic attraction is:
\[ U = -\frac{k e^2}{r} \]
Therefore, the total energy \( E \) is:
\[ E = K + U = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{2k e^2}{2r} = -\frac{k e^2}{2r} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Orbital Momentum of the Electron
The orbital momentum \( L \) of the electron is given by:
\[ L = m_e v r \]
Substituting the expression for \( v \) from Step 1, we get:
\[ L = m_e \left( \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \right) r = m_e r \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e^2 r^2 \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r k e^2} \]

The total energy of the electron is:
\[ \boxed{-\frac{k e^2}{2r}} \]
The orbital momentum of the electron is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{m_e r k e^2}} \]",0.637

For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to:

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the collision and the resulting orbit of the conglomerate. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the space station before the collision
The space station is in a circular orbit with radius \( R \). The speed \( v_2 \) of the space station can be found using the circular orbit speed formula:
\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision
Let the speed of the meteorite just before the collision be \( v_1 \). Since the meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, its speed is purely radial.

### Step 3: Determine the speed of the conglomerate immediately after the collision
The collision is perfectly inelastic, so the meteorite and the space station stick together to form a conglomerate with mass \( m_1 + m_2 \). The speed \( v_c \) of the conglomerate immediately after the collision can be found using the conservation of momentum:
\[
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_c
\]
Solving for \( v_c \):
\[
v_c = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate
The conglomerate moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of \( R/2 \) from the center of the Earth. This implies that the orbit is an ellipse with the Earth at one of its foci. The minimum distance \( R/2 \) is the periapsis distance \( r_p \).

### Step 5: Determine the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate
The minimum speed of the conglomerate is at the periapsis, which is \( v_p \). The maximum speed of the conglomerate is at the apoapsis, which is \( v_a \). For an elliptical orbit, the speed at any point can be found using the vis-viva equation:
\[
v^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
where \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Earth and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the ellipse.

At periapsis \( r = r_p = R/2 \):
\[
v_p^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

At apoapsis \( r = r_a \):
\[
v_a^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r_a} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

The semi-major axis \( a \) can be found using the relationship between the semi-major axis, periapsis, and apoapsis:
\[
a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2}
\]

### Step 6: Determine the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth
The maximum distance \( r_a \) is the apoapsis distance. Using the vis-viva equation at periapsis and the fact that the total energy is conserved, we can find \( r_a \).

### Step 7: Determine the condition that \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) must obey
The condition that \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) must obey is that the total energy of the system after the collision must be negative, ensuring a closed orbit. The total energy \( E \) of the system after the collision is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{r}
\]
At periapsis \( r = R/2 \):
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}
\]
For a closed orbit, \( E < 0 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 < \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}
\]
\[
v_c^2 < \frac{4GM}{R}
\]
Substituting \( v_c \):
\[
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 < \frac{4GM}{R}
\]
\[
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 < \frac{4GM}{R}
\]

This is the condition that \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) must obey.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\left( \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 < \frac{4GM}{R}}

This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, we need to consider the relationship between the apparent magnitude, the solid angle, and the distance.

First, let's recall the definition of apparent magnitude. The apparent magnitude \( m \) of a galaxy is given by:
\[ m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \right) + C \]
where \( L \) is the luminosity of the galaxy, \( d \) is the distance to the galaxy, and \( C \) is a constant that depends on the units used for \( L \) and the zero point of the magnitude scale.

Next, let's consider the surface magnitude. The surface magnitude \( \mu \) is defined as the magnitude per unit solid angle. If the galaxy subtends a solid angle \( \Omega \) in the sky, then the surface magnitude is:
\[ \mu = \frac{m}{\Omega} \]

The solid angle \( \Omega \) subtended by the galaxy is given by:
\[ \Omega = \frac{A}{d^2} \]
where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the galaxy.

Substituting the expression for \( m \) into the expression for \( \mu \), we get:
\[ \mu = \frac{-2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \right) + C}{\frac{A}{d^2}} \]

To simplify this, we can use the property of logarithms that \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \right) = \log_{10} L - \log_{10} (4\pi d^2) = \log_{10} L - \log_{10} (4\pi) - 2 \log_{10} d \). Substituting this into the expression for \( \mu \), we get:
\[ \mu = \frac{-2.5 (\log_{10} L - \log_{10} (4\pi) - 2 \log_{10} d) + C}{\frac{A}{d^2}} \]
\[ \mu = \frac{-2.5 \log_{10} L + 2.5 \log_{10} (4\pi) + 5 \log_{10} d + C}{\frac{A}{d^2}} \]

Now, let's multiply the numerator by \( \frac{d^2}{A} \):
\[ \mu = \left( -2.5 \log_{10} L + 2.5 \log_{10} (4\pi) + 5 \log_{10} d + C \right) \frac{d^2}{A} \]

Notice that the term \( 5 \log_{10} d \) in the numerator is multiplied by \( d^2 \) in the denominator, which results in:
\[ 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} \]

However, the term \( 5 \log_{10} d \) in the numerator is multiplied by \( d^2 \) in the denominator, which results in:
\[ 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} \]

Therefore, the term \( 5 \log_{10} d \) in the numerator is multiplied by \( d^2 \) in the denominator, which results in:
\[ 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} = 5 \log_{10} d \cdot \frac{d^2}{A} \]

Thus, the surface magnitude \( \mu \) is independent of the distance \( d \) to the galaxy. Therefore, the surface magnitude is:

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( r \) is the distance between the sun and the planet, and \( \hat{r} \) is the radial unit vector.
3. Using Newton's second law, \( F = m \mathbf{a} \), we get:
   \[
   m \mathbf{a} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{r}
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{r}
   \]
4. The acceleration \( \mathbf{a} \) can be written in terms of the radial and tangential components:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} = \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 \right) \hat{r} + \left( r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \right) \hat{\theta}
   \]
   where \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate.
5. Equating the radial components, we get:
   \[
   \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
   \]
6. Equating the tangential components, we get:
   \[
   r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} = 0
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt} \left( r^2 \dot{\theta} \right) = 0
   \]
   Therefore, \( r^2 \dot{\theta} \) is a constant, which is the angular momentum per unit mass \( h \):
   \[
   r^2 \dot{\theta} = h
   \]
7. Substituting \( \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2} \) into the radial equation, we get:
   \[
   \ddot{r} - r \left( \frac{h}{r^2} \right)^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   \ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
   \]
   Multiplying through by \( r^3 \), we get:
   \[
   r^3 \ddot{r} - h^2 = -GM r
   \]
   Rearranging, we have:
   \[
   r^3 \ddot{r} + GM r = h^2
   \]
8. To solve this differential equation, we use the substitution \( u = \frac{1}{r} \). Then \( \dot{r} = -\frac{\dot{u}}{u^2} \) and \( \ddot{r} = -\frac{\ddot{u}}{u^2} + 2 \frac{\dot{u}^2}{u^3} \). Also, \( \dot{\theta} = hu^2 \), so \( \frac{d}{dt} = hu^2 \frac{d}{d\theta} \). Therefore:
   \[
   \ddot{r} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \left( h^2 u^4 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - 2 h^2 u^3 \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right)^2 \right) + 2 \frac{h^2 u^4 \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right)^2}{u^3} = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2}
   \]
   Substituting into the equation, we get:
   \[
   -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + \frac{GM}{u} = h^2
   \]
   Multiplying through by \( -\frac{1}{h^2 u^2} \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
   \]
   The general solution to this differential equation is:
   \[
   u = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
   \]
   where \( A \) and \( \theta_0 \) are constants. Therefore:
   \[
   r = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{h^2}{GM + A h^2 \cos(\theta - \theta_0)}
   \]
   This is the equation of an ellipse with the sun at one focus.

### Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Areas
Kepler's second law states that a line segment joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

**Derivation:**
1. The area \( dA \) swept out by the planet in a small time interval \( dt \) is given by:
   \[
   dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
   \]
2. The rate at which area is swept out is:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}
   \]
3. From the conservation of angular momentum, we know that \( r^2 \dot{\theta} = h \), so:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} h
   \]
   Since \( h \) is a constant, the rate at which area is swept out is constant. Therefore, equal areas are swept out in equal intervals of time.

### Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Harmonies
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

**Derivation:**
1. For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis \( a \) is given by:
   \[
   a = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 - e^2)}
   \]
   where \( e \) is the eccentricity of the ellipse.
2. The period \( T \) of the orbit is the time it takes to complete one full revolution, which is the circumference of the ellipse divided by the average speed. For an elliptical orbit, the period is given by:
   \[
   T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}}
   \]
3. Squaring both sides, we get:
   \[
   T^2 = 4\pi^2 \frac{a^3}{GM}
   \]
   Therefore, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3}
\]",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

### Case I: Actual Observed Rotation Curve of the Galaxy

For the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, the rotational velocity \(V\) is a function of the distance \(R\) from the Galactic Centre. The relationship between the rotational velocity and the distance is complex and typically requires empirical data to determine. However, we can use the fact that the Galaxy is in a state of approximate circular motion and apply the centripetal force equation.

The centripetal force required to keep a mass \(m\) in a circular orbit of radius \(R\) with velocity \(V\) is given by:
\[ F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mV^2}{R} \]

This centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force due to the mass \(M(R)\) enclosed within radius \(R\):
\[ F_{\text{gravitational}} = \frac{GM(R)m}{R^2} \]

Equating the two forces, we get:
\[ \frac{mV^2}{R} = \frac{GM(R)m}{R^2} \]
\[ V^2 = \frac{GM(R)}{R} \]
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{GM(R)}{R}} \]

To find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, we take the derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(R\) and evaluate it at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM(R)}{R}} \right) \]
Using the chain rule, we get:
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM(R)}{R} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{GM(R)}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{GM(R)}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{V^2}{R} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{V^2}{R} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2R} \left( \frac{G}{V} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - V \right) \]

Evaluating this at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = \frac{1}{2R_0} \left( \frac{G}{V_0} \frac{dM(R_0)}{dR} - V_0 \right) \]

### Case II: Hypothetical Scenario with No Dark Matter

In this hypothetical scenario, the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter, and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre. The mass enclosed within radius \(R\) is simply the total mass \(M\) of the Galaxy:
\[ M(R) = M \]

The rotational velocity \(V\) is then given by:
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \]

To find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, we take the derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(R\) and evaluate it at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM}{R} \right)^{-1/2} \left( -\frac{GM}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{V}{2R} \]

Evaluating this at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} \]

### Final Answers

The expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, \(\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}\), for the two cases are:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{2R_0} \left( \frac{G}{V_0} \frac{dM(R_0)}{dR} - V_0 \right)} \]
\[ \boxed{-\frac{V_0}{2R_0}} \]",0.728

\[ V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \]
\[ V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D \]

For the solar neighborhood where \(D \ll R_0\), we can approximate \(\Omega\) as \(\Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D\). Since \(\Omega = \frac{V}{R}\), we have:

\[ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \left.\frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)\right|_{R=R_0} = \left.\frac{R \frac{dV}{dR} - V}{R^2}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{R_0 \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0^2} = \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{R_0} \]

Thus, \(\Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{R_0} D\). Substituting this into the expressions for \(V_r\) and \(V_t\), we get:

We are given that \(V_r = AD \sin 2l\) and \(V_t = AD \cos 2l + BD\). Comparing the expressions, we identify:

\[ AD \sin 2l = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) D \sin l \]
\[ AD \cos 2l + BD = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) D R_0 \cos l - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D \]

From the first equation, we get:

\[ A \sin 2l = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \sin l \]
\[ A \sin 2l = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \sin l \]
\[ A = \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{2} \]

\[ A \cos 2l + B = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) R_0 \cos l - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \]
\[ B = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) R_0 \cos l - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - A \cos 2l \]
\[ B = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) R_0 \cos l - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R R_0} - \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{2} \cos 2l \]

The total mechanical energy per unit mass of a gas element in a circular orbit around a compact object is the sum of its kinetic energy per unit mass and its potential energy per unit mass.

The potential energy per unit mass of a gas element at a distance \(R\) from the compact object is given by:
\[
U = -\frac{GM}{R}
\]
The kinetic energy per unit mass of a gas element in a circular orbit is given by:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}v^2
\]
where \(v\) is the orbital velocity. For a circular orbit, the orbital velocity is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]
Thus, the kinetic energy per unit mass is:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{2R}
\]
The total mechanical energy per unit mass is the sum of the kinetic energy per unit mass and the potential energy per unit mass:
\[
E = K + U = \frac{GM}{2R} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2R}
\]
Now, we need to find the change in the total mechanical energy per unit mass as the gas element moves from \(R_{max}\) to \(r\):
\[
\Delta E = E(r) - E(R_{max}) = \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} \right) = \frac{GM}{2R_{max}} - \frac{GM}{2r}
\]
Since \(r \ll R_{max}\), the term \(\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}\) is much smaller than \(\frac{GM}{2r}\), and we can approximate:
\[
\Delta E \approx -\frac{GM}{2r}
\]
Therefore, the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element is:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}
\]
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}

The key point is that the distance between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, which affects the total travel time of the laser beam.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial distance between the Solar System and the mirror is \( D \).
   - The speed of light is \( c \).
   - The time for the laser beam to travel to the mirror and back is \( T \).
   - The separation \( S \) between the Solar System and the mirror after time \( t \) is given by \( S = D e^{H_0 t} \).

2. **Travel Time Analysis:**
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time it takes for the laser beam to travel from the Solar System to the mirror.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time it takes for the laser beam to travel back from the mirror to the Solar System.
   - The total travel time is \( T = t_1 + t_2 \).

3. **Distance Traveled:**
   - At time \( t_1 \), the distance to the mirror is \( D e^{H_0 t_1} \).
   - The speed of light is constant, so the time \( t_1 \) is given by:
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c}
     \]
   - At time \( t_1 + t_2 \), the distance to the mirror is \( D e^{H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} = D e^{H_0 T} \).
   - The time \( t_2 \) is given by:
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{D e^{H_0 T}}{c}
     \]

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time \( T \) is:
     \[
     T = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} + \frac{D e^{H_0 T}}{c}
     \]
   - Since \( t_1 \) is the time it takes for the light to reach the mirror, we can approximate \( t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c} \) for small \( H_0 \). Using the approximation \( e^x \approx 1 + x \) for \( x \ll 1 \), we get:
     \[
     e^{H_0 t_1} \approx e^{H_0 \frac{D}{c}} \approx 1 + H_0 \frac{D}{c}
     \]
   - Substituting this into the equation for \( T \), we get:
     \[
     T \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + H_0 \frac{D}{c}\right) + \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + H_0 T\right) = \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D}{c} H_0 \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D}{c} H_0 T = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{D^2}{c^2} H_0 + \frac{D}{c} H_0 T
     \]
   - Rearranging terms to isolate \( H_0 \), we get:
     \[
     T - \frac{2D}{c} \approx \frac{D^2}{c^2} H_0 + \frac{D}{c} H_0 T = H_0 \left(\frac{D^2}{c^2} + \frac{D}{c} T\right)
     \]
   - Solving for \( H_0 \), we get:
     \[
     H_0 \approx \frac{T - \frac{2D}{c}}{\frac{D^2}{c^2} + \frac{D}{c} T} = \frac{T c^2 - 2D c}{D^2 + D c T} = \frac{c (T c - 2D)}{D (D + c T)}
     \]

Therefore, the expression for the Hubble constant \( H_0 \) is:
\[

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"To determine the expression for the total gravitational wave luminosity \( L_{GW} \) of the binary neutron star system, we start by considering the dimensions of the quantities involved. The gravitational wave luminosity \( L_{GW} \) has dimensions of power, which is energy per unit time, or \( \text{[M][L]^2}[T]^{-3} \).

The relevant physical constants and variables are:
- The mass of each neutron star, \( M \), with dimensions \( \text{[M]} \).
- The radius of the orbit, \( R \), with dimensions \( \text{[L]} \).
- The gravitational constant, \( G \), with dimensions \( \text{[M]^{-1}[L]^3}[T]^{-2} \).
- The speed of light, \( c \), with dimensions \( \text{[L]}[T]^{-1} \).

We need to form a combination of these quantities that has the dimensions of power. Let's assume the expression for \( L_{GW} \) is of the form:
\[ L_{GW} = k G^a M^b c^d R^e \]
where \( k \) is a dimensionless constant. We need to determine the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( d \), and \( e \) such that the dimensions on both sides of the equation match.

The dimensions of the right-hand side are:
\[ [G^a M^b c^d R^e] = \left( \text{[M]^{-1}[L]^3}[T]^{-2} \right)^a \left( \text{[M]} \right)^b \left( \text{[L]}[T]^{-1} \right)^d \left( \text{[L]} \right)^e = \text{[M]}^{b-a} \text{[L]}^{3a+d+e} \text{[T]}^{-2a-d} \]

We need this to equal the dimensions of power, \( \text{[M][L]^2}[T]^{-3} \). Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:
1. \( b - a = 1 \)
2. \( 3a + d + e = 2 \)
3. \( -2a - d = -3 \)

From the third equation, we can solve for \( d \):
\[ d = 3 - 2a \]

Substitute \( d = 3 - 2a \) into the second equation:
\[ 3a + (3 - 2a) + e = 2 \]
\[ a + 3 + e = 2 \]
\[ e = -1 - a \]

Now we have \( d \) and \( e \) in terms of \( a \). Substitute \( b = a + 1 \), \( d = 3 - 2a \), and \( e = -1 - a \) into the expression for \( L_{GW} \):
\[ L_{GW} = k G^a M^{a+1} c^{3-2a} R^{-1-a} \]

We are given that \( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power, so \( 3 - 2a = -1 - a \). Solving for \( a \):
\[ 3 - 2a = -1 - a \]
\[ 4 = a \]
\[ a = 4 \]

Now substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the expressions for \( b \), \( d \), and \( e \):
\[ b = a + 1 = 5 \]
\[ d = 3 - 2a = 3 - 8 = -5 \]
\[ e = -1 - a = -1 - 4 = -5 \]

Therefore, the expression for \( L_{GW} \) is:

The power radiated in gravitational waves \( L_{GW} \) is given by the expression:

\[ L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \]

The power radiated is also equal to the rate of change of the total energy of the system. For a binary system in a circular orbit, the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. The kinetic energy \( K \) of each star is:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 \]

where \( v \) is the orbital velocity. The orbital velocity \( v \) can be expressed in terms of the radius \( R \) and the period \( T \) of the orbit. Using the centripetal force equation and the gravitational force, we have:

\[ M \frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M^2}{R^2} \]

Solving for \( v^2 \), we get:

\[ v^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \]

Thus, the kinetic energy of each star is:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2} M \left( \frac{G M}{R} \right) = \frac{G M^2}{2R} \]

Since there are two stars, the total kinetic energy is:

\[ K_{\text{total}} = 2 \times \frac{G M^2}{2R} = \frac{G M^2}{R} \]

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is:

\[ U = -\frac{G M^2}{R} \]

Therefore, the total energy \( E \) of the system is:

\[ E = K_{\text{total}} + U = \frac{G M^2}{R} - \frac{G M^2}{R} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R} \]

The rate of change of the total energy is:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{2} \left( -\frac{1}{R^2} \right) \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} \]

Since the power radiated in gravitational waves is equal to the rate of change of the total energy, we have:

\[ L_{GW} = \frac{dE}{dt} \]

Substituting the expressions for \( L_{GW} \) and \( \frac{dE}{dt} \), we get:

\[ \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} \]
