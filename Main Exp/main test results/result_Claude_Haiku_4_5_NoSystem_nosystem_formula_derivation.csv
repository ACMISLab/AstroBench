2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"# Derivation of the Virial Theorem

I'll derive the virial theorem step-by-step from Newton's second law.

## Starting Point: Newton's Second Law

For each molecule in the system, Newton's second law states:
$$\vec{F} = m\vec{a} = m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$

where $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$ is the velocity.

## Step 1: Form the Virial Expression

Taking the inner product of position vector $\vec{r}$ with both sides of Newton's second law:

$$\vec{r} \cdot \vec{F} = m\vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$

## Step 2: Sum Over All Molecules

Summing over all N molecules in the system:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}_i}{dt}$$

## Step 3: Manipulate the Right Side

The right side can be rewritten using the product rule:

$$\vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{v}) - \vec{v} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$$

Since $\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{v}$:

$$\vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{v}) - v^2$$

where $v^2 = \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}$

## Step 4: Express in Terms of Kinetic Energy

Note that $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} = v^2$, so:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}_i}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i - 2\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2}m_i v_i^2$$

$$= \frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i - 2K$$

where $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2}m_i v_i^2$ is the total kinetic energy.

## Step 5: Separate External and Internal Forces

The force $\vec{F}_i$ on molecule $i$ consists of:
- External forces: $\vec{F}_i^{ext}$
- Internal forces from other molecules: $\vec{F}_i^{int}$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{ext} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{int}$$

By Newton's third law, internal forces cancel in pairs, so:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{int} = 0$$

Therefore:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{ext}$$

## Step 6: The Virial Theorem

Combining results:

$$\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{ext} = \frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i - 2K}$$

## For a System in Equilibrium (Time-Averaged Form):

If the system is in a steady state or we time-average over a long period:

$$\boxed{\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i^{ext} \right\rangle = -2\langle K \rangle}$$

**For a self-gravitating system** (where internal forces are gravitational and external forces are negligible):

$$\boxed{2K + U = 0}$$

or 

$$\boxed{K = -\frac{U}{2}}$$

where $U$ is the gravitational potential energy. This is the **virial theorem for self-gravitating systems**, which is fundamental for determining galaxy masses.",0.546

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

## 1. Conservation of Linear Momentum

### Derivation:

Sum the equations of motion over all bodies:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$$

**Key observation:** Each pair $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ appears in the double sum. Since:
$$\frac{\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|^3} = -\frac{\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}}{|\mathbf{r}_{j}-\mathbf{r}_{i}|^3}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{r}_{i} \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\mathbf{r}_{i}\times\mathbf{r}_{j}$$

**Key observation:** The double sum cancels because:
$$\mathbf{r}_{i}\times\mathbf{r}_{j} + \mathbf{r}_{j}\times\mathbf{r}_{i} = 0$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = 0$$

### **First Integral (Angular Momentum):**
$$\boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}}$$

This gives **3 conserved quantities** (components of angular momentum).

## 3. Conservation of Energy

### Derivation:

Take the dot product of the equation of motion with $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$:

$$m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$$

Sum over all $i$:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$$

The left side is:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}^2\right) = \frac{dT}{dt}$$

For the right side, using the chain rule and pair symmetry:

$$-\sum_{\substack{i,j \\ i<j}} G m_{i}m_{j} \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|}\right) = \frac{d}{dt}\left(-\sum_{\substack{i,j \\ i<j}} \frac{G m_{i}m_{j}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|}\right) = \frac{dU}{dt}$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{d}{dt}(T + U) = 0$$

### **First Integral (Total Energy):**
$$\boxed{E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2}m_{i}\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}^2 - \sum_{\substack{i,j \\ i<j}} \frac{G m_{i}m_{j}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|} = \text{constant}}$$

This gives **1 conserved quantity**.

Equation (ii): When $f=\pi$ (apoapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its maximum value: $r_{A}=\frac{p}{1-e}=a(1+e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

I'll prove both velocity formulas using conservation of energy and angular momentum.

## Given Information
- **μ** = GM (gravitational parameter)
- **a** = semi-major axis
- **e** = eccentricity
- **r_A** = aphelion distance = a(1+e)
- **r_P** = perihelion distance = a(1-e)

---

## Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum

The specific angular momentum **h** is constant throughout the orbit:

$$h = r_A v_A = r_P v_P$$

Substituting the distances:
$$a(1+e) \cdot v_A = a(1-e) \cdot v_P$$

$$v_A(1+e) = v_P(1-e) \quad \text{...(1)}$$

## Step 2: Conservation of Energy

The specific orbital energy is constant:

$$E = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

At any point on the orbit:
$$E = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

**At Aphelion:**
$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1}{1+e} - \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2-(1+e)}{2(1+e)}\right)$$

$$v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1-e}{1+e}$$

$$\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}} \quad \text{...(2)}$$

$$v_P = v_A \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e}$$

Substituting equation (2):
$$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}} \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e}$$

$$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1-e}}{\sqrt{1+e}} \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e}$$

$$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{(1+e)}{(1-e)} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1-e}}{\sqrt{1+e}}$$

$$v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1+e}}{\sqrt{1-e}}$$

$$\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}} \quad \text{...(3)}$$

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"# Solution: Orbital Period Around a Cylindrical Planet

## Problem Setup

We have:
- A very long cylindrical planet with radius $R$ and average density $\rho$
- A satellite orbiting at distance $d$ from the cylinder's axis
- Need to find: relationship between period $P$ and distance $d$

## Step 1: Calculate the Gravitational Force

For a **long cylindrical mass distribution**, the gravitational field at perpendicular distance $d$ from the axis is:

$$g(d) = \frac{2G\lambda}{d}$$

where $\lambda$ is the linear mass density (mass per unit length).

**Derivation of linear mass density:**

The linear mass density is:
$$\lambda = \rho \cdot A = \rho \pi R^2$$

where $A = \pi R^2$ is the cross-sectional area.

Therefore:
$$g(d) = \frac{2G\rho\pi R^2}{d}$$

## Step 2: Apply Orbital Mechanics

For a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{d} = mg(d)$$

This simplifies to:
$$v^2 = g(d) \cdot d = \frac{2G\rho\pi R^2}{d} \cdot d = 2G\rho\pi R^2$$

## Step 3: Relate Velocity to Period

The orbital velocity is:
$$v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}$$

## Step 4: Solve for Period

Substituting:
$$\left(\frac{2\pi d}{P}\right)^2 = 2G\rho\pi R^2$$

$$\frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2} = 2G\rho\pi R^2$$

$$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2G\rho\pi R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G\rho R^2}$$

## **Final Result**

$$\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho R^2}} \cdot d}$$

Or equivalently:

$$\boxed{P \propto d \quad \text{(linear relationship)}}$$

## Given Information
- Both galaxies have radius R
- Galaxy A (spiral): rotational velocity at distance R is v
- Galaxy B (elliptical): radial velocity dispersion is v
- Galaxy B has uniform, evenly-spaced star distribution

---

## Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)

For a rotating system in circular motion, gravitational force provides centripetal force.

**At radius R from the center:**

$$F_{\text{gravity}} = F_{\text{centripetal}}$$

$$\frac{GM_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$

**Solving for $M_A$:**

$$\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2R}{G}}$$

---

## Galaxy B (Elliptical Galaxy)

For a spherically symmetric system in virial equilibrium, we use the **virial theorem**.

The virial theorem relates kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy:

$$2K + U = 0$$

For a self-gravitating system with velocity dispersion σ (in this case σ = v):

$$2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}M_B v^2 = \frac{GM_B^2}{R}$$

This simplifies to:

$$M_B v^2 = \frac{GM_B^2}{R}$$

**Solving for $M_B$:**

$$\boxed{M_B = \frac{v^2R}{G}}$$

---

## Result

Interestingly, **both galaxies have the same mass**:

$$\boxed{M_A = M_B = \frac{v^2R}{G}}$$

### Physical Interpretation
- **Galaxy A**: The rotational velocity directly probes the enclosed mass through circular orbital mechanics
- **Galaxy B**: The velocity dispersion reflects random motions in hydrostatic equilibrium, which also depends on the enclosed mass supporting the system against gravitational collapse

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"# Solution: Density of a White Dwarf

## Step 1: Set Up the Equilibrium Condition

At equilibrium, the electron degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational pressure:

$$p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}|$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{\Omega}{3V} = \frac{3GM^2}{5 \cdot 3V \cdot R}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}$$

## Step 2: Relate Number Density to Mass Density

The number density of electrons $n$ is related to the mass density $\rho$ through:

$$n = \frac{Z}{A}\rho/m_u$$

where:
- $Z$ = atomic number (electrons per nucleus)
- $A$ = mass number (nucleons per nucleus)
- $m_u$ ≈ nucleon mass

This is because the star contains $M/A m_u$ nuclei total, and each nucleus contributes $Z$ electrons.

## Step 3: Express Volume and Radius

For a uniform density sphere:
$$V = \frac{4\pi R^3}{3}$$

Therefore: $R = \left(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}$

## Step 4: Substitute and Simplify

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A}\frac{\rho}{m_u}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5V \cdot \left(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A}\frac{\rho}{m_u}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2(4\pi)^{1/3}}{5V^{2/3} \cdot 3^{1/3}}$$

## Step 5: Solve for Density

Isolating $\rho^{5/3}$:

$$\rho^{5/3} = \frac{AM_u}{Z} \left[\frac{GM^2(4\pi)^{1/3}m_e}{5\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \cdot 3^{1/3}V^{2/3}}\right]^{3/5}$$

After substituting $V = \frac{4\pi R^3}{3} = \frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)$ and simplifying:

## Final Result

$$\boxed{\rho = \left(\frac{3\pi^2}{2}\right)^{2/5} \frac{Gm_e}{{\hbar^2}} \left(\frac{A}{Z}\right)^{2/5} M^{2/5} m_u^{2/5}}$$

Or equivalently:

$$\boxed{\rho \propto \left(\frac{A}{Z}\right)^{2/5} M^{2/5}}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- **$M^{2/5}$ dependence**: More massive white dwarfs are denser due to stronger gravity
- **$(A/Z)^{2/5}$ dependence**: Higher $A/Z$ ratio increases density (more mass per electron)
- **No $R$ dependence**: The radius is determined by mass and density through $V = M/\rho$",0.637

## Problem Setup
We need to find the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1$ and $\vec{m}_2$ separated by distance $r$.

## Solution Process

### Step 1: Identify the Magnetic Field from Dipole 1
The magnetic field created by dipole $\vec{m}_1$ at the location of dipole $\vec{m}_2$ is:

$$\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$$

where $\hat{r}$ points from dipole 1 toward dipole 2.

### Step 2: Calculate the Interaction Energy
The potential energy of dipole $\vec{m}_2$ in the field $\vec{B}_1$ is:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$$

Substituting the expression for $\vec{B}_1$:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}\right]$$

### Step 3: Distribute the Dot Product

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"# Solution: Meteorite Collision with Space Station

## Problem Analysis

We have:
- Space station in circular orbit at radius R
- Meteorite approaching radially (toward Earth's center)
- After collision: conglomerate with perihelion r_min = R/2
- Need to find conditions and orbital characteristics

---

## (i) Speed of Meteorite Before Collision

**For the space station in circular orbit:**
$$v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

**At the collision point (radius R), apply conservation of momentum:**

Let $v_m$ = meteorite speed (radially inward) and $v_c$ = conglomerate speed (tangential, just after collision).

Tangential momentum conservation:
$$m_1 v_m \sin(\theta) + m_2 v_s = (m_1 + m_2)v_c$$

Since the meteorite is radially approaching, at the collision instant the tangential components must satisfy:
$$m_2 v_s = (m_1 + m_2)v_c$$

Therefore:
$$v_c = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

**For the conglomerate orbit with perihelion r_p = R/2:**

At perihelion (closest approach), all velocity is tangential:
$$v_p = v_c = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

Using the orbit equation at perihelion:
$$\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{r_p} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_p^2 + \frac{L^2}{2(m_1+m_2)r_p^2}$$

where $L = (m_1+m_2)r_p v_p$ (angular momentum).

This gives us:
$$v_p = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r_p}\cdot\frac{2r_a}{r_p + r_a}}$$

where $r_a$ is the aphelion distance.

**From radial momentum conservation at collision:**
$$m_1 v_m = (m_1 + m_2)v_{r,collision}$$

where $v_{r,collision}$ is the radial velocity component after collision (which becomes zero at perihelion by energy conservation).

Using energy conservation and the constraint that R is where collision occurs:

$$\boxed{v_m = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\left[\frac{2(m_1+m_2)}{m_2} - 1\right]^{1/2}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\cdot\frac{2m_1 + m_2}{m_2}}}$$

---

## Shape of Orbit

**The orbit is an ellipse** with:
- Perihelion: $r_p = \frac{R}{2}$
- Semi-major axis: $a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2}$

---

## (ii) Minimum and Maximum Speeds of Conglomerate

**Minimum speed (at perihelion, r = R/2):**
$$\boxed{v_{min} = \frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$$

**For maximum speed (at aphelion), use energy and angular momentum conservation:**

Total energy of conglomerate:
$$E = -\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{2a}$$

At aphelion: $v_a = \frac{r_p}{r_a}v_p$

Using $\varepsilon = \frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p}$ (eccentricity), the aphelion distance becomes:

$$r_a = \frac{r_p(1+e)}{1-e}$$

**Maximum speed (at aphelion):**
$$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\cdot\frac{r_p}{r_a}}}$$

where $r_a$ is determined below.

---

## (iii) Maximum Distance from Earth's Center

Using energy conservation from collision point (R, $v_c$):
$$\frac{1}{2}v_c^2 - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2a}$$

$$a = \frac{GM}{2(GM/R - v_c^2/2)} = \frac{R}{2(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{2(m_1+m_2)^2})}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{r_a = 2a - r_p = 2a - \frac{R}{2} = \frac{R(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_2^2 + (m_1+m_2)^2}}$$

---

## Condition for Feasibility

For the scenario to be possible:
$$\boxed{m_1 > \frac{m_2}{2}}$$

This ensures that the meteorite has sufficient momentum to deflect the space station inward to r_p = R/2.",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"# Solution: Surface Magnitude Independence from Distance

## Definition and Setup

**Surface magnitude** is defined as:
$$\mu = m + 2.5\log_{10}(\Omega)$$

where:
- $m$ = apparent magnitude of the galaxy
- $\Omega$ = solid angle subtended by the galaxy (in arcmin²)
- The factor 2.5 log₁₀ converts solid angle differences to magnitude differences

## Step 1: Relate Apparent Magnitude to Distance

The apparent magnitude depends on the absolute magnitude $M$ and distance $d$ via the distance modulus:

$$m = M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5$$

where distance is measured in parsecs.

## Step 2: Relate Solid Angle to Distance

For a galaxy with physical radius $R$, the solid angle it subtends is related to its angular size. For small angles:

$$\Omega \propto \left(\frac{R}{d}\right)^2$$

More precisely:
$$\Omega = \frac{\pi R^2}{d^2} \cdot k$$

where $k$ is a geometric constant. Therefore:

$$\log_{10}(\Omega) = \log_{10}(R^2) + \log_{10}(k) - 2\log_{10}(d)$$

## Step 3: Calculate Surface Magnitude

Substituting into the surface magnitude formula:

$$\mu = M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5 + 2.5[\log_{10}(R^2) + \log_{10}(k) - 2\log_{10}(d)]$$

$$\mu = M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5 + 2.5\log_{10}(R^2) + 2.5\log_{10}(k) - 5\log_{10}(d)$$

## Step 4: Simplify

$$\mu = M - 5 + 2.5\log_{10}(R^2) + 2.5\log_{10}(k) + \cancel{5\log_{10}(d) - 5\log_{10}(d)}$$

$$\boxed{\mu = M + 2.5\log_{10}(R^2) + 2.5\log_{10}(k) - 5 = \text{constant}}$$

## Conclusion

The distance-dependent terms ($5\log_{10}(d)$ and $-5\log_{10}(d)$) **exactly cancel**. 

In a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude depends only on:
- The galaxy's **absolute magnitude** $M$
- Its **physical size** $R$
- Geometric constants

**Therefore, surface magnitude is independent of distance** to the galaxy. This makes surface brightness a useful tool for identifying galaxies without needing to know their distance!",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}

I'll systematically derive all three of Kepler's laws from Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Starting Point: Universal Gravitation

Newton's law of universal gravitation states:
$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

where:
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of the central body (sun)
- m = mass of orbiting body (planet)
- r = distance between centers

---

## **Kepler's First Law: Law of Ellipses**

*""Planets orbit in elliptical paths with the sun at one focus""*

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** Set up the force equation as centripetal force:
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

**Step 2:** Consider angular momentum conservation (no torque about the sun):
$$L = mr^2\omega = \text{constant}$$

**Step 3:** Express velocity in terms of angular momentum:
$$v = \frac{L}{mr}$$

**Step 4:** Substitute into the energy equation (total energy E is conserved):
$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}$$

$$E = \frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \frac{GMm}{r}$$

**Step 5:** This is the energy equation for a central force problem. The solution to the equation of motion under inverse-square forces is:

$$r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$

This is the **polar equation of a conic section**, where:
- **p** = semi-latus rectum
- **e** = eccentricity

For bound orbits (E < 0), we have **e < 1**, which describes an **ellipse**.

✓ **Kepler's First Law is proved.**

---

## **Kepler's Second Law: Law of Equal Areas**

*""A line from the sun to a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times""*

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** Define areal velocity (area swept per unit time):
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$

**Step 2:** Angular momentum is:
$$L = mr^2\omega = mr^2\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{L}{mr^2}$$

**Step 3:** Substitute into the areal velocity:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \cdot \frac{L}{mr^2} = \frac{L}{2m}$$

**Step 4:** Since gravitational force is central (no external torque):
$$\frac{dL}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = \text{constant}$$

**Step 5:** Therefore:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \text{constant}$$

This means the areal velocity is **constant** – equal areas are swept in equal times.

✓ **Kepler's Second Law is proved.**

---

## **Kepler's Third Law: Law of Periods**

*""The square of orbital period is proportional to the cube of semi-major axis""*

$$T^2 \propto a^3$$

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** For a circular orbit (or average of ellipse), gravitational force provides centripetal force:
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\omega^2 r$$

**Step 2:** Solve for angular velocity:
$$\omega^2 = \frac{GM}{r^3}$$

**Step 3:** Relate angular velocity to period (T):
$$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

**Step 4:** Substitute:
$$\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2 = \frac{GM}{r^3}$$

$$\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{r^3}$$

**Step 5:** Solve for T²:
$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

For an ellipse, replace r with semi-major axis **a**:

$$\boxed{T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}a^3}$$

Or in proportional form:
$$\boxed{T^2 \propto a^3}$$

✓ **Kepler's Third Law is proved.**

18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"# Solution: Deriving the Radial Gradient of Rotational Velocity

## Part 1: Relating Oort's Constants to the Velocity Gradient

Starting from the exact expressions:
$$V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l$$
$$V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\cos l - \Omega D$$

For a cloud at distance $D$ from the Sun with Galactic longitude $l$, the distance from the Galactic center is:
$$R \approx R_0 - D\cos l$$

### Expanding $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$ to first order:

$$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}(R - R_0) = -\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} D\cos l$$

Since $V = \Omega R$:
$$\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) = \frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}$$

At $R_0$:
$$\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}$$

### Matching with Oort's Constants:

Substituting into $V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l$ and comparing with $V_r = AD\sin 2l$:

$$A = -R_0\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}\cos l \sin l = -R_0\sin l \cos l\left(\frac{1}{R_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right)$$

Using $\sin l \cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2l$:

$$\boxed{A = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{2R_0}}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2A}$$

## Part 2: Case I - Actual Rotation Curve

Observational data shows that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is approximately **flat** in the solar neighborhood (dominated by dark matter halo).

For a flat rotation curve: $V \approx \text{constant}$

$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \approx 0}$$

Physically, this means $A \approx \frac{V_0}{2R_0}$ (Oort's constant).

Numerically: $A \approx 14.8$ km/s/kpc

---

## Part 3: Case II - Hypothetical Case (Mass Concentrated at Center)

For a point mass $M$ at the Galactic center:
$$V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

Taking the derivative:
$$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{GM}{2R^2\sqrt{GM/R}} = -\frac{V}{2R}$$

At $R_0$:
$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}}$$

This negative gradient contrasts sharply with Case I and explains why dark matter must exist: the observed flat rotation curve cannot be explained by visible matter alone concentrated at the center.

20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

## Step 1: Establish the Relationship Between Angular and Linear Velocities

For circular orbits:
$$\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$$

At the Sun's location:
$$\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}$$

## Step 2: Expand Angular Velocity for the HI Cloud

For a cloud at distance $R$ from the Galactic Center, we expand using Taylor series around $R_0$:

$$\Omega = \frac{V(R)}{R}$$

$$\Omega \approx \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)\right|_{R=R_0}(R-R_0)$$

Computing the derivative:
$$\frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) = \frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}$$

At $R = R_0$:
$$\left.\frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}$$

## Step 3: Find $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$ in Terms of $(R - R_0)$

$$\Omega - \Omega_0 = \left[\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right](R-R_0)$$

## Step 4: Relate Geometric Distances

For small distances ($D \ll R_0$), the geometry in the Galactic plane gives:
$$R - R_0 \approx -D\sin l$$

(The negative sign indicates that $R < R_0$ for clouds on the near side of the Galaxy)

## Step 5: Substitute into the Original Velocity Expressions

**For line-of-sight velocity:**
$$V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l$$

$$V_r = \left[\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right](-D\sin l) \cdot R_0 \sin l$$

$$V_r = -\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D\sin^2 l$$

Using the identity $\sin^2 l = \frac{1-\cos 2l}{2}$:

$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]}$$

**For transverse velocity:**
$$V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\cos l - \Omega D$$

Substituting and using $\cos 2l = 2\cos^2 l - 1$:

$$V_t = -\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D\cos^2 l - \frac{V_0}{R_0}D$$

After simplification using $\cos^2 l = \frac{1+\cos 2l}{2}$:

$$\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]}$$

## Final Results

$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]}$$

$$\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]}$$

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"# Solution: Mechanical Energy Released in Accretion Disc

## Problem Setup

We need to find the total mechanical energy released per unit mass as gas accretes from radius $R_{max}$ to radius $r$.

## Step 1: Total Mechanical Energy in a Keplerian Orbit

For a gas element in a circular Keplerian orbit around a compact object of mass $M$, the total mechanical energy per unit mass is:

$$E_{total} = K + U = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r}$$

where $v$ is the orbital velocity and $U$ is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass.

## Step 2: Apply Keplerian Condition

For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

Therefore:
$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

## Step 3: Calculate Total Energy at Arbitrary Radius

Substituting the Keplerian velocity into the total energy expression:

$$E(r) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}$$

This is the total mechanical energy per unit mass at radius $r$.

## Step 4: Energy at Initial and Final Positions

**At initial radius $R_{max}$:**
$$E(R_{max}) = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$$

**At final radius $r$:**
$$E(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}$$

## Step 5: Calculate Energy Released

The energy released per unit mass is the decrease in total mechanical energy (energy that becomes unavailable to the orbiting gas):

$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = E(R_{max}) - E(r)$$

$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} - \left(-\frac{GM}{2r}\right)$$

$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$$

## Step 6: Simplification Using $r \ll R_{max}$

Since $r \ll R_{max}$, the term $\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} \ll \frac{GM}{2r}$, so:

$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- As the gas spirals inward through viscous dissipation, gravitational potential energy is converted to heat
- The energy released is predominantly determined by the final radius $r$
- This efficiency increases significantly as matter approaches the compact object, explaining why accretion is so energy-efficient
- For black holes with $r$ approaching the event horizon, the energy release becomes extremely efficient",0.728

## Given Information
- Mirror placed at initial distance $D$ from Solar System
- Laser sent for time $T$ and returns
- Expansion law: $S(t) = se^{H_0 t}$ where $s = D$ (initial separation)
- Approximation: $e^x \approx 1 + x$ for $x \ll 1$

## Problem-Solving Process

### Step 1: Set up the expansion law

The distance from Earth to the mirror at time $t$ is:
$$S(t) = De^{H_0 t}$$

### Step 2: Account for light travel time

Since light must travel against the expanding space, we need to find when the light reaches the mirror.

The light reaches the mirror when the distance traveled by light equals the expanding distance:
$$\int_0^{t_1} c \, dt = \int_0^{t_1} S(t) \, dt$$

where $t_1$ is the time for light to reach the mirror.

$$ct_1 = \int_0^{t_1} De^{H_0 t} \, dt = D\left[\frac{e^{H_0 t_1} - 1}{H_0}\right]$$

$$ct_1 = \frac{D}{H_0}\left(e^{H_0 t_1} - 1\right)$$

### Step 3: Solve for $t_1$ using the approximation

For small $H_0 t_1$, use $e^{H_0 t_1} \approx 1 + H_0 t_1$:

$$ct_1 \approx \frac{D}{H_0}(H_0 t_1) = Dt_1$$

This gives: $t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c}$

### Step 4: Account for return journey

By the same analysis, the return journey takes approximately time $t_2 \approx \frac{D}{c}$ (at the mirror's receding position).

Total round-trip time:
$$T = t_1 + t_2 \approx 2\frac{D}{c} + \text{correction terms}$$

For a more precise treatment, the distance at which the mirror is located when light reflects is:
$$S(t_1) = De^{H_0 t_1} \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)$$

### Step 5: Include expansion effects

The total time $T$ accounts for light traveling outward and returning through expanding space:

$$T \approx \frac{2D}{c}\left(1 + \frac{H_0 D}{2c}\right)$$

For the case where $H_0 D/c \ll 1$:

$$T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{H_0 D^2}{c^2}$$

### Step 6: Solve for $H_0$

$$T - \frac{2D}{c} = \frac{H_0 D^2}{c^2}$$

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2}{D^2}\left(T - \frac{2D}{c}\right) = \frac{c(cT - 2D)}{D^2}}$$

## Alternative Simplified Form

If $cT \gg 2D$ (reasonable for cosmological distances):

$$\boxed{H_0 \approx \frac{cT}{D^2} - \frac{2c}{D}}$$

Or more compactly:

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c}{D}\left(\frac{cT}{D} - 2\right)}$$

This expression shows that $H_0$ depends on the round-trip time delay due to universal expansion, allowing the cosmologist to determine the expansion rate from a simple laboratory experiment.",0.728

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

## Part 1: Dimensional Analysis

I need to find an expression for $L_{GW}$ in terms of $G$, $c$, $M$, and $R$, where $c$ and $R$ have the same power.

**General form:**
$$L_{GW} = k \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^d \cdot R^e$$

where $k = \frac{2}{5}$ is the dimensionless constant.

**Dimensional analysis:**

| Quantity | Dimensions |
|----------|-----------|
| $L_{GW}$ (Power) | $[M L^2 T^{-3}]$ |
| $G$ | $[M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]$ |
| $c$ | $[L T^{-1}]$ |
| $M$ | $[M]$ |
| $R$ | $[L]$ |

**Setting up the equation:**
$$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]^a \cdot [L T^{-1}]^b \cdot [M]^d \cdot [L]^e$$

$$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = [M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a}] \cdot [L^b T^{-b}] \cdot [M^d] \cdot [L^e]$$

**Equating exponents:**

- **Mass:** $1 = -a + d$ → $d = 1 + a$
- **Length:** $2 = 3a + b + e$
- **Time:** $-3 = -2a - b$ → $b = -3 + 2a$

**Using the constraint** $b = e$ (given that $c$ and $R$ have the same power):

$$-3 + 2a = e$$

Substituting into the length equation:
$$2 = 3a + (-3 + 2a) + (-3 + 2a)$$
$$2 = 3a - 3 + 2a - 3 + 2a$$
$$2 = 7a - 6$$
$$a = \frac{8}{7}$$

**Solving for other exponents:**
- $b = -3 + 2(8/7) = -3 + 16/7 = -5/7$
- $e = b = -5/7$
- $d = 1 + 8/7 = 15/7$

## Part 2: Final Expression

$$\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^{8/7}}{c^{5/7}} \frac{M^{15/7}}{R^{5/7}}}$$

**Alternative forms:**

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^{8/7} M^{15/7}}{c^{5/7} R^{5/7}}$$

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \left(\frac{GM}{c}\right)^{8/7} \left(\frac{M}{R}\right)^{1} c^2 / R^{1/7}$$

Or more compactly:
$$\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5}\frac{G^{8/7}M^{15/7}}{c^{5/7}R^{5/7}}}$$

This expression shows that the gravitational wave luminosity increases sharply with mass and decreases with orbital separation, consistent with the physics of inspiraling binary systems.",0.637

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"# Solution: Rate of Change of Orbital Radius for Binary Neutron Stars

## Step 1: Establish Energy Conservation Relationship

The energy radiated as gravitational waves must equal the rate of energy loss from the system:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$$

where the negative sign indicates energy is being lost.

## Step 2: Find the Orbital Energy

For a binary system with two equal masses $M$ in circular orbits of radius $R$ around their center of mass, each star orbits at distance $R$ from the center of mass.

The total orbital energy is:
$$E = -\frac{GM^2}{2R}$$

This can be derived from gravitational potential energy ($-\frac{GM^2}{2R}$) and kinetic energy ($+\frac{GM^2}{4R}$), which sum to give the result above.

## Step 3: Calculate dE/dt Using the Chain Rule

Using the hint with the chain rule:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(-\frac{GM^2}{2R}\right)$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(R^{-1})$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot (-1) \cdot R^{-2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

## Step 4: Apply Energy Conservation

Setting the energy balance equation:

$$\frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$$

## Step 5: Solve for dR/dt

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5} \cdot \frac{2R^2}{GM^2}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4G^3M^3}{5c^5R^3}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4G^3M^3}{5c^5R^3}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The negative sign indicates that the orbital radius is **decreasing** with time. As gravitational waves carry away energy, the two neutron stars spiral inward toward each other, eventually merging.",0.49
