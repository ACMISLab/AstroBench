2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"## Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Concept of Virial Theorem
The virial theorem is a relationship between the average kinetic energy and the average potential energy in a stable, self-gravitating system. This theorem is useful for estimating the mass of galaxies based on the motions of their stars or gas. The concept involves the inner product of the position vector of a molecule and the force acting on it, summed over all molecules in the system.

## Step 2: Formulate the Inner Product $r \cdot F$ Using Newton’s Second Law
Newton's second law states that the force $F$ acting on an object is equal to its mass $m$ times its acceleration $a$. Mathematically, this is expressed as $F = ma$. The acceleration $a$ can be represented as the second derivative of the position vector $r$ with respect to time $t$, so $a = \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$. Therefore, the force $F$ can be written as $F = m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$.

## Step 3: Derive the Expression for the Time Derivative of the Inner Product $r \cdot F$
To derive the virial theorem, consider the time derivative of the inner product $r \cdot F$. This derivative can be expressed as $\frac{d}{dt}(r \cdot F)$. Using the product rule, this derivative can be expanded into two terms: $r \cdot \frac{dF}{dt} + F \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}$.

## Step 4: Substitute Newton’s Second Law into the Expression for the Time Derivative
Substituting $F = m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$ into the expression for the time derivative of the inner product gives $r \cdot m\frac{d^3r}{dt^3} + m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}$.

## Step 5: Average the Time Derivative Over a Time Period
To derive the virial theorem, we average the time derivative of the inner product over a time period. This involves integrating the expression from Step 4 over time and dividing by the time period.

## Step 6: Simplify the Averaged Expression to Obtain the Virial Theorem Formula
After averaging, the expression simplifies. The first term, involving the third derivative of $r$, typically averages out to zero over a long enough time period. The second term simplifies to $m(\frac{dr}{dt})^2$, which is related to the kinetic energy. When summed over all molecules and averaged over time, this expression leads to the virial theorem formula: $2\langle T \rangle = -\sum\langle r \cdot F \rangle$, where $\langle T \rangle$ is the average kinetic energy, and $\sum\langle r \cdot F \rangle$ represents the average virial.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2\langle T \rangle = -\sum\langle r \cdot F \rangle}$",0.546

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

The given problem asks us to derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system, where each body's motion is described by the dynamical equation:
$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$.

## Step 2: Define the First Integrals of Motion
First integrals of motion are conserved quantities that do not change over time. In classical mechanics, these can include energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

## Step 3: Derive the Energy Integral
To derive the energy integral, we start with the dynamical equation and take the dot product with the velocity $\mathbf{v}_{i}$ of the $i^{th}$ body:
$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_{i}$.
We can simplify this expression to obtain the energy integral:
$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_{i} v_{i}^{2} \right)=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{2}} \frac{d}{dt} \left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|$.

## Step 4: Derive the Momentum Integral
To derive the momentum integral, we sum the dynamical equation over all $N$ bodies:
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$.
Since the force between two bodies is equal and opposite, the double sum vanishes, leaving us with the momentum integral:
$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{v}_{i} \right)=0$.

## Step 5: Derive the Angular Momentum Integral
To derive the angular momentum integral, we take the cross product of the dynamical equation with the position vector $\mathbf{r}_{i}$:
$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \times \mathbf{r}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \times \mathbf{r}_{i}$.
We can simplify this expression to obtain the angular momentum integral:
$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \mathbf{v}_{i} \right)=0$.

We are given two equations for the velocities of a celestial body in elliptical motion at aphelion ($v_A$) and perihelion ($v_P$). Our task is to prove these equations using the principles of astronomy and orbital mechanics.

## Step 2: Recall the relevant orbital mechanics principles
In orbital mechanics, the vis-viva equation relates the velocity of an object in orbit to its distance from the central body and the semi-major axis of the orbit. The vis-viva equation is given by $v = \sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}$, where $v$ is the velocity, $\mu$ is the standard gravitational parameter, $r$ is the distance from the central body, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.

## Step 3: Derive the velocity equation at aphelion
At aphelion, the distance $r$ is equal to $a(1+e)$, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. Substitute $r = a(1+e)$ into the vis-viva equation and simplify.

## Step 4: Derive the velocity equation at perihelion
At perihelion, the distance $r$ is equal to $a(1-e)$. Substitute $r = a(1-e)$ into the vis-viva equation and simplify.

## Step 5: Simplify the equations
After substituting the values of $r$ into the vis-viva equation, simplify the resulting expressions to obtain the given equations for $v_A$ and $v_P$.

## Step 6: Write the final equations
After simplification, the equations should match the given equations: $v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$ and $v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$.

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the relationship between the period $P$ of a satellite orbiting a very long cylindrical planet and its distance $d$ from the center of the planet, considering the planet's average density $\rho$ and radius $R$.

## Step 2: Determine Relevant Formulas
For a cylindrical planet, we can consider it as a long rod. The gravitational force exerted by this rod on the satellite can be described by the formula for gravitational force due to a long rod:
\[F = \frac{2GMm}{d\sqrt{d^2 + R^2}}\]
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, and $m$ is the mass of the satellite.

## Step 3: Calculate Mass of the Planet
To express the mass of the planet in terms of its density and radius, we use the formula for the density of the planet:
\[\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\pi R^2h}\]
Since the planet is very long, we can consider $h$ (height of the cylinder) as $d$, thus:
\[M = \rho \pi R^2h = \rho \pi R^2d\]

## Step 4: Simplify Gravitational Force Formula
Substitute $M$ into the gravitational force formula:
\[F = \frac{2G(\rho \pi R^2d)m}{d\sqrt{d^2 + R^2}}\]
Cancelling $d$:
\[F = \frac{2G\rho\pi R^2m}{\sqrt{d^2 + R^2}}\]

## Step 5: Use Centripetal Force Formula
According to Newton's law, the centripetal force on the orbiting satellite is equal to the gravitational force:
\[\frac{4\pi^2m}{P^2}d = \frac{2G\rho\pi R^2m}{\sqrt{d^2 + R^2}}\]
Eliminating $m$:
\[\frac{2\pi d}{P^2} = \frac{G\rho\pi R^2}{\sqrt{d^2 + R^2}}\]

## Step 6: Final Expression
Solving for $P$, we get:
\[P^2 = \frac{2\pi^2d\sqrt{d^2+R^2}}{G\rho\pi R^2}\]
Taking square root of both sides and solving for $P$ gives us the final expression relating $P$ and $d$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi^2d\sqrt{d^2+R^2}}{G\rho\pi R^2}}}$",0.637

## Step 1: Understand the given information
We have two galaxies, A and B, both with a radius R. Galaxy A is spiral and has a rotational velocity v at a distance R from its center. Galaxy B is spherical elliptical, composed of evenly-spaced stars, and has a radial velocity dispersion equal to v.

## Step 2: Determine the relevant formulas
To calculate the mass of Galaxy A, we can use the formula for rotational velocity:
v = √(G \* M / R)
where v is the rotational velocity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius.

To calculate the mass of Galaxy B, we can use the formula for radial velocity dispersion:
v = √(2 \* G \* M / R)
Note that the formula for radial velocity dispersion is different from the rotational velocity formula.

## Step 3: Derive the mass of Galaxy A
Rearrange the formula to solve for M:
M = (v^2 \* R) / G
This formula allows us to calculate the mass of Galaxy A.

## Step 4: Derive the mass of Galaxy B
Rearrange the formula to solve for M:
M = (v^2 \* R) / (2 \* G)
This formula allows us to calculate the mass of Galaxy B.

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the given problem and formulas
To solve this problem, we need to understand the two main formulas provided: one for the electron degeneracy pressure and the other for the gravitational pressure. We'll need to equate these two pressures to find an expression for the number density of electrons, which is a key component in determining the density of the white dwarf.

## Step 2: Express the number density of electrons in terms of the star's mass, A, Z, and other constants
Given that the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, we can relate the number density of electrons ($n$) to the mass density of the star ($\rho$). We know that the mass of each nucleus is approximately $Am_p$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass, and each nucleus contributes $Z$ electrons. Thus, the total mass of the star ($M$) is related to the mass density by $M = \rho V$. Since the number density of nuclei ($n_{nuclei}$) is related to $n$ by $n = Zn_{nuclei}$, and the mass density of the star can also be expressed as $\rho = n_{nuclei}Am_p$, we can find an expression for $n$ in terms of $\rho$, $A$, $Z$, and $m_p$.

## Step 3: Derive the relationship between mass density and the number density of electrons
From the mass density equation $\rho = n_{nuclei}Am_p$ and knowing $n = Zn_{nuclei}$, we can find that $n = \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p}$. This equation expresses the number density of electrons in terms of the mass density of the star and the atomic numbers.

## Step 4: Equate the electron degeneracy pressure to the gravitational pressure
By equating the two pressure formulas, $pelectron = -p_{grav}$, we can solve for $n$ and then use the relationship found in step 3 to express the mass density ($\rho$) in terms of $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants.

## Step 5: Solve for the density of the white dwarf
Substituting $pelectron = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$ and $p_{grav} = \frac{3GM^2}{5V}$ into the equation and expressing $V$ as $\frac{M}{\rho}$ and $n$ in terms of $\rho$ (as found in step 3), we can solve for $\rho$.

## Step 6: Perform the substitution and algebraic manipulation
Given the complexity of directly solving for $\rho$ with the given equations, we simplify by substituting $n = \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p}$ into the equation for $pelectron$ and equating it to $p_{grav}$. This will involve significant algebraic manipulation and simplification to isolate $\rho$.

## Step 7: Simplify the expression for $\rho$ in terms of $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants
After substitution and algebraic manipulation, we should arrive at an expression for $\rho$ as a function of $M$, $A$, $Z$, $G$, $\hbar$, $m_e$, $m_p$, and $\pi$. Simplifying this expression will give us the desired relationship.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{(3\pi^2)^{2/3}(Am_p)^2 \cdot (5m_e)\cdot(3GM^2)}{5\hbar^2 \cdot Z^{5/3} \cdot M^{2/3} \cdot 3}}$",0.637

The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

We need to calculate the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is given by $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is given by $\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$.

## Step 2: Calculate the magnetic field of the first dipole at the position of the second dipole.
We can use the formula for the magnetic field of a dipole to find the field of the first dipole at the position of the second dipole. Let $\vec{m}_1$ be the magnetic dipole moment of the first dipole and $\vec{r}$ be the position vector from the first dipole to the second dipole. The magnetic field of the first dipole at the position of the second dipole is then $\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$.

## Step 3: Calculate the interaction energy between the two dipoles.
Now we can calculate the interaction energy between the two dipoles using the formula $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$. The interaction energy of the second dipole with the magnetic field of the first dipole is then $U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1 = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$.

## Step 4: Simplify the interaction energy expression.
We can simplify this expression by expanding the dot product and combining terms: $U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} [\vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1)]$. This can be further simplified to $U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} [3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2]$.

## Step 5: Finalize the answer by carefully writing down the simplified expression for the interaction energy between the two magnetic dipoles.
Using the derived expression for the interaction energy, we can now write down the simplified form: $U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} [\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})]$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} [\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})]}$",0.49

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"## Step 1: Define the problem and the forces involved
We have an electron orbiting a proton, and the only force considered is the Coulombic attraction between the two charges. The electron has mass $m_e$ and charge $-e$, while the proton has mass $m_p$ and charge $+e$. Given that $m_p \gg m_e$, we can treat the proton as being at rest.

## Step 2: Determine the potential energy due to the Coulombic attraction
The potential energy $V$ between two charges is given by Coulomb's Law: $V = -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. Since we are only considering the attraction between the electron and the proton, the potential energy is $V = -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$.

## Step 3: Determine the kinetic energy of the electron
Since the electron is in orbit, it has kinetic energy. Assuming circular motion, the kinetic energy $K$ of the electron is $\frac{1}{2}m_e v^2$, where $v$ is the velocity of the electron.

## Step 4: Express the total energy of the electron
The total energy $E$ of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. Thus, $E = K + V = \frac{1}{2}m_e v^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$.

## Step 5: Express the orbital momentum of the electron
The orbital momentum or angular momentum $L$ of the electron is $L = m_e v r$.

## Step 6: Use the condition for circular orbit to relate velocity and radius
For a circular orbit, the centrifugal force equals the Coulombic attraction force: $\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}$. This implies $v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}$. Substituting $v^2$ in the kinetic energy expression gives the total energy in terms of $r$.

## Step 7: Substitute $v^2$ in the total energy expression
Substituting $v^2$ from the circular orbit condition into the total energy expression, we get $E = \frac{1}{2}m_e \left(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}\right) - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$.

## Step 8: Simplify the total energy expression
Simplifying, $E = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$.

## Step 9: Provide the final expressions for total energy and orbital momentum
The total energy of the electron is $E = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$. The orbital momentum is $L = m_e v r = m_e r\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}}$.

The problem involves a collision between a meteorite and a space station in orbit around the Earth, leading to the formation of a conglomerate that orbits the Earth. The key physical principles involved are the conservation of momentum and angular momentum, and the laws governing orbits, particularly Kepler's laws and the vis-viva equation. We also need to apply the principles of elastic and inelastic collisions.

# Step 2: Analyze the Initial Conditions
Before the collision, the meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, implying it has no initial angular momentum. The space station is in a circular orbit with radius R. We need to determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision and express it in terms of G, M, and R.

# Step 3: Determine the Speed of the Meteorite Before Collision
Using the vis-viva equation for an object in orbit around a central body (like the Earth), the speed \(v\) of an object at a distance \(r\) from the center of the Earth can be expressed as \(v = \sqrt{GM(2/r - 1/a)}\), where \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For the meteorite approaching along a radius, we can consider its path as a degenerate orbit with a semi-major axis equal to the radius of the Earth (since it would theoretically be an orbit that ""crashes"" into the Earth without an orbital trajectory). Thus, the speed of the meteorite just before collision can be found when \(r = R\), and considering that its orbit's semi-major axis is \(R\), simplifying to \(v = \sqrt{GM/R}\).

# Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Orbit of the Conglomerate
After the collision, the conglomerate forms a closed orbit with a minimum distance of \(R/2\). Given that there's a minimum and later a maximum distance to the Earth, the orbit is not circular but elliptical. The shape is an ellipse with one of its foci being the center of the Earth.

# Step 5: Calculate Minimum and Maximum Speeds of the Conglomerate
Using Kepler's laws and the vis-viva equation, we know that the speed of an object in an elliptical orbit varies, with the maximum speed at periapsis (the point closest to the focus) and the minimum speed at apoapsis (the point farthest from the focus). For the conglomerate, at periapsis (\(r = R/2\)), the maximum speed \(v_{max} = \sqrt{GM(2/(R/2) - 2/a)}\), and at apoapsis, the minimum speed \(v_{min} = \sqrt{GM(2/a - 2/a)}\). However, without the exact semi-major axis \(a\) of the conglomerate's orbit, we can't directly calculate these speeds without additional information. We need to infer \(a\) from the conditions given.

# Step 6: Determine the Semi-major Axis of the Conglomerate's Orbit
Given that the minimum distance is \(R/2\) and knowing that for an elliptical orbit, the sum of the distances from any point on the orbit to the two foci is constant and equal to \(2a\), with the center of the Earth being one of the foci, we can infer the semi-major axis. If we consider the maximum distance (when the conglomerate is at the other end of its major axis) to be \(x\), \(x + (R/2) = 2a\). Without more information, we must understand that the maximum distance \(x\) needs to be determined by other means, possibly involving the specifics of the collision and conservation of angular momentum.

# Step 7: Consider the Conservation of Angular Momentum and Momentum
After the collision, the total momentum and angular momentum are conserved. The total momentum before the collision (meteorite's mass times its velocity plus the space station's mass times its velocity) equals the total momentum after the collision (total mass times the velocity of the conglomerate). Similarly, angular momentum is conserved, but since the meteorite's path is radial, its angular momentum is zero, simplifying our calculations to involve only the space station's angular momentum.

# Step 8: Condition for m1 and m2
For the scenario to be possible, the collision must result in a combined system that has enough energy and angular momentum to achieve the described orbit. This implies specific conditions on the masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), which relate to the velocity and energy of the meteorite, the velocity of the space station, and the resulting velocity and orbit of the conglomerate. The exact condition would depend on the specifics of energy and momentum conservation during the inelastic collision.

The final answer is: $\boxed{The final answer is not a simple number but involves complex derivations and conditions based on the principles of orbital mechanics, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum.}$",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"## Step 1: Understand the concept of surface magnitude
Surface magnitude is defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of a galaxy has, typically measured in $mag/arcmin²$. This concept is useful for analyzing galaxies because their light is spread out over a large solid angle, making them appear dim.

## Step 2: Recall the definition of apparent magnitude
Apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a celestial object as seen from Earth, and it is defined by the formula: $m = -2.5log_{10}(F) + C$, where $F$ is the flux density of the object and $C$ is a constant.

## Step 3: Consider the relationship between flux density and distance
In a non-expanding universe, the flux density $F$ of an object is inversely proportional to the square of the distance $d$ to the object: $F \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$.

## Step 4: Analyze the effect of distance on apparent magnitude
Substituting the relationship between flux density and distance into the formula for apparent magnitude, we get: $m = -2.5log_{10}(\frac{k}{d^2}) + C$, where $k$ is a constant. Simplifying this expression, we find that the apparent magnitude is dependent on the logarithm of the distance.

## Step 5: Introduce the concept of solid angle
Solid angle is a measure of how large an object appears in the sky, and it is defined as the ratio of the area of the object's projection on a sphere to the square of the radius of that sphere.

## Step 6: Relate solid angle to distance
The solid angle of an object is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the object: $\Omega \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$.

## Step 7: Define surface magnitude in terms of apparent magnitude and solid angle
The surface magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle: $\mu = \frac{m}{\Omega}$.

## Step 8: Substitute the expressions for apparent magnitude and solid angle
Substituting the expressions for apparent magnitude and solid angle into the definition of surface magnitude, we get: $\mu = \frac{-2.5log_{10}(\frac{k}{d^2}) + C}{\frac{K'}{d^2}}$, where $K'$ is a constant.

## Step 9: Simplify the expression for surface magnitude
Simplifying the expression for surface magnitude, we find that the distance terms cancel out: $\mu = \frac{-2.5log_{10}(k) + C}{K'}$. This shows that the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.

The final answer is: There is no final numerical answer to this problem, as it is a proof of the independence of surface magnitude on distance.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

**Law of Universal Gravitation**

The law of universal gravitation, also known as Newton's law of gravity, states that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

F = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r^2

where:

* F is the gravitational force
* G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
* m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects
* r is the distance between the centers of the two objects

**Deriving Kepler's Laws**

Kepler's laws describe the motion of planets in our solar system. There are three laws, which we will derive one by one using the law of universal gravitation.

**Kepler's First Law: The Law of Ellipses**

Kepler's first law states that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. To derive this law, let's consider a planet of mass m orbiting the Sun of mass MS.

Let's assume the planet's position at a given time is described by the vector r from the Sun to the planet. The gravitational force between the Sun and the planet is:

F = -G \* (MS \* m) / r^2

where the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.

Now, we can use Newton's second law of motion to describe the planet's acceleration:

a = F / m = -G \* MS / r^2

To find the planet's orbit, we need to integrate the acceleration over time. We can do this using the following differential equation:

d²r/dt² = a = -G \* MS / r^2

To solve this equation, we can use the following substitution:

u = 1/r

du/dt = -v/r^2

where v is the planet's velocity.

Substituting u into the differential equation, we get:

d²u/dφ² + u = -G \* MS / h^2

where φ is the true anomaly (the angle between the planet's position vector and the x-axis), and h is the planet's angular momentum per unit mass.

The solution to this equation is:

u(φ) = A \* cos(φ) + B \* sin(φ) + G \* MS / h^2

where A and B are constants of integration.

The above equation represents an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci. This is Kepler's first law.

**Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas**

Kepler's second law states that the line connecting the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. To derive this law, let's consider the planet's velocity at a given time:

v = dr/dt

We can use the chain rule to express the velocity in terms of the true anomaly:

v = du/dt \* dr/du = -v/r^2 \* du/dφ

Now, we can express the area swept out by the planet in a given time as:

dA/dt = (1/2) \* r \* v \* sin(φ)

Using the expression for velocity, we get:

dA/dt = (1/2) \* r \* (-v/r^2) \* sin(φ) \* du/dφ

Simplifying this expression, we get:

dA/dt = h/2

where h is the planet's angular momentum per unit mass.

Since the angular momentum is constant, the area swept out by the planet is proportional to time. This is Kepler's second law.

**Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Harmonies**

Kepler's third law states that the square of the planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. To derive this law, let's consider the planet's energy:

E = (1/2) \* mv^2 - G \* MS / r

Using the expression for velocity, we get:

E = (1/2) \* m \* (-v/r^2)^2 - G \* MS / r

Simplifying this expression, we get:

E = -G \* MS / (2 \* a)

where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Now, we can use Kepler's second law to express the planet's orbital period:

T = 2 \* π \* √(a^3 / (G \* MS))

Squaring both sides of this equation, we get:

T^2 = (4 \* π^2) \* a^3 / (G \* MS)

This is Kepler's third law.

In conclusion, we have derived Kepler's three laws from the law of universal gravitation:

1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci (Kepler's first law).
2. The line connecting the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Kepler's second law).
3. The square of the planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (Kepler's third law).

These laws describe the motion of planets in our solar system and have been widely used to predict the orbits of planets and other celestial bodies.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

## Step 2: Recall the relationship between rotational velocity and angular velocity
The rotational velocity $V$ is related to the angular velocity $\Omega$ by $V = \Omega R$, where $R$ is the distance from the Galactic Centre.

## Step 3: Derive the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity
Using the chain rule, we can write $\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d(\Omega R)}{dR} = \Omega \frac{dR}{dR} + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \Omega + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}$.

## Step 4: Consider Case (I) - the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy
For the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, we can use the Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ to describe the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components. However, to derive the expression for $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, we need to relate $A$ and $B$ to the angular velocity $\Omega$ and its derivative $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$.

## Step 5: Consider Case (II) - the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter
In this case, we assume that the whole mass of the Galaxy is concentrated at its centre. The rotational velocity can be described by the Keplerian rotation curve $V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M$ is the mass of the Galaxy.

## Step 6: Derive the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity for Case (II)

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Oort's constants A and B are defined in terms of the line-of-sight velocity and transverse velocity components as $V_{r} = AD\sin2l$ and $V_{t} = AD\cos2l+BD$.

## Step 2: Express the line-of-sight velocity $V_r$ in terms of $\Omega$ and $\Omega_0$
$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$.

## Step 3: Express the transverse velocity $V_t$ in terms of $\Omega$ and $\Omega_0$

## Step 4: Use the approximation $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})\approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\cdot(R-R_{0})$ and $R \approx R_0$ for the solar neighborhood to simplify the expressions for $V_r$ and $V_t$.
Using this approximation, we can simplify the expressions for $V_r$ and $V_t$ to first order.

## Step 5: Derive the first-order approximation for $V_r$ and $V_t$ using the result from step 4.
Substituting the approximations, we get $V_r \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\cdot(R-R_{0})R_{0} \sin l$ and $V_t \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\cdot(R-R_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.

## Step 6: Use the relationship $\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$ to express $\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ in terms of $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ and $V_0$.
$\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = \left.\frac{d(V/R)}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = \frac{R_0\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} - V_0}{R_0^2}$.

Comparing the coefficients, we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{R_0\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} - V_0}{R_0}$ and $B = -\frac{V_0}{R_0}$.

## Step 8: Evaluate A and B for case (I) and case (II) to determine their values in terms of $V_0$, $R_0$, and $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$.
Since the expression for A and B do not depend on the specific rotation curve scenario, the values of A and B will be the same for both case (I) and case (II).

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"## Step 1: Understand the problem and the scenario
The problem describes the accretion of matter onto a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole. We are given a stationary, geometrically thin disc of matter with a maximum radius $R_{max}$ and a minimum stable orbital radius $R_{min}$, where $R_{min}/R_{max} \ll 1$. We need to find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by the gas as it orbits from $R_{max}$ to a radius $r \ll R_{max}$.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and assumptions
We are assuming that the gas element follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit. This implies that the gravitational force between the gas element and the compact object is the dominant force. We also ignore the gravitational interaction between particles within the accretion disc.

## Step 3: Determine the mechanical energy of the gas element
The mechanical energy of the gas element consists of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by $\frac{1}{2}v^2$, where $v$ is the orbital velocity. The potential energy is given by $-\frac{GM}{r}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the compact object, and $r$ is the orbital radius.

## Step 4: Express the mechanical energy in terms of the orbital radius
Using the Keplerian orbit assumption, we can express the orbital velocity $v$ in terms of the orbital radius $r$ as $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$. Substituting this into the kinetic energy expression, we get $\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}$. The total mechanical energy is then $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}$.

## Step 5: Calculate the change in mechanical energy as the gas orbits from $R_{max}$ to $r$
The change in mechanical energy is given by $\Delta E = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \Delta m = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{R_{max}}\right) \Delta m$.

## Step 6: Simplify the expression and ignore higher-order terms
Since $R_{min}/R_{max} \ll 1$ and $r \ll R_{max}$, we can ignore the term $\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{R_{max}}$ as it is much smaller than the term $-\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}$. The expression simplifies to $\Delta E \approx -\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} \Delta m$.

## Step 7: Express the final answer in terms of G, M, and r
The total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas is $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx -\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}}$",0.728

The problem describes a thought experiment for determining the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ in a Steady-State-Universe model. A mirror is placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System, and a laser beam is directed towards it for a period of time $T$. We are tasked with finding an expression for $H_{0}$ as a function of $D$, $c$ (the speed of light), and $T$. The separation between the Solar System and the mirror is given by the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation.

## Step 2: Calculate the separation between the Solar System and the mirror at time $t=T$ when the radiation returns.
Using the given law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, we can calculate the separation at time $t=T$. However, we can simplify the calculation by using the approximation $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$, as the universe's expansion rate is relatively slow.

## Step 3: Apply the approximation $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$ to simplify the calculation.
Considering $x=H_{0}T\ll1$, we can use the approximation $e^{H_{0}T}\approx1+H_{0}T$. Substituting this into the separation law, we get $S\approx s(1+H_{0}T)$.

## Step 4: Consider the total path traveled by the radiation and the expansion of the universe.
The total distance traveled by the radiation is $2S$, and the universe expands during the time it takes for the radiation to return. The increase in separation due to expansion is $s(H_{0}T)$. As the radiation travels, the echo will return after a longer distance, which is approximated as $cT$.

## Step 5: Equate the total distance traveled by the radiation with the separation at time $t=T$.
Using the approximation from Step 3 and considering the expansion, we equate $2s(1+H_{0}T)$ with $cT$ and $2s+2s(H_{0}T)$.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation to obtain an expression for $H_0$.
Simplifying $cT=2s+2sH_{0}T$ and canceling $s$, we get $cT=2D+2DH_{0}T$ since initially $s=D$.

## Step 7: Rearrange the equation to solve for $H_0$.
Rearranging the equation to solve for $H_{0}$, we get $cT-2D=2DH_{0}T$. Then, solving for $H_{0}$, we get $H_{0}=\frac{cT-2D}{2DT}$.

## Step 8: Simplify the expression further.
The expression can be simplified further by dividing the numerator and denominator by $T$, resulting in $H_{0}=\frac{c-\frac{2D}{T}}{2D}$.

## Step 9: Express the final answer.
After simplifying, we obtain the final expression for $H_{0}$ as a function of $D$, $c$, and $T$.

We are given a problem in the context of astronomy, specifically dealing with the gravitational wave luminosity of a binary neutron star system. We need to derive a formula for the total gravitational wave luminosity, denoted as $L_{GW}$, which depends on the mass of the neutron stars $M$, the radius of their orbit $R$, the gravitational constant $G$, and the speed of light $c$. We also know that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$.

## Step 2: Analyze the given information
The problem states that the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits, and we are looking for an expression that includes a dimensionless constant, physical constants $G$ and $c$, and the variables $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power.

## Step 3: Recall the general form of the gravitational wave luminosity formula
From general relativity, the gravitational wave luminosity is typically proportional to the square of the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the system.

## Step 4: Construct the formula for $L_{GW}$
Assuming a circular orbit, the quadrupole moment is proportional to $M R^2$, and its second time derivative is proportional to $M R^2 \omega^4$, where $\omega$ is the orbital frequency. Using Kepler's third law, $\omega^2 = \frac{GM}{R^3}$, so $\omega^4 = \frac{G^2 M^2}{R^6}$. Thus, the luminosity should be proportional to $\frac{G^2 M^2}{R^6} M^2 R^4 \propto \frac{G^2 M^4}{R^2}$. Additionally, we expect a factor of $c^{-5}$ to get the correct units for luminosity.

## Step 5: Combine the terms to form the expression for $L_{GW}$
Considering the given dimensionless constant $\frac{2}{5}$ and the factors derived in the previous steps, we can construct the expression for $L_{GW}$. The luminosity is therefore given by $L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5}$ multiplied by $c^5$ (since $c$ and $R$ have the same power), giving us the correct dimensions of energy per unit time.

## Step 6: Express the formula using the exact power dependence on $c$ and $R$
Taking into account that $c$ and $R$ have the same power, we get the correct formula as $L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5} \cdot c^5 = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}$.

To relate the energy loss to the change in radius, we differentiate the orbital energy with respect to time: $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(-\frac{G M^2}{2R}) = \frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$.

## Step 4: Equate the energy loss to the gravitational wave luminosity
The rate of energy loss due to gravitational waves is equal to the luminosity of gravitational waves: $-\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = L_{GW}$. So, we have $\frac{G M^2}{2R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.

## Step 5: Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$
Rearranging the equation to solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, we get: $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{4G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}$.

## Step 6: Simplify the expression if necessary
No further simplification is necessary.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}}$",0.49
