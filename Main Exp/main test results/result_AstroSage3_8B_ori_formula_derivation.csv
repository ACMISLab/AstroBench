Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to:

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No," 

To solve this problem, we need to apply Newton's second law and the concept of the virial. The virial theorem states that for a thermodynamic system in equilibrium, the time average of the virial is equal to twice the total kinetic energy of the system. We will derive this formula by considering the time derivative of the virial and applying Newton's second law.

First, let's recall Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

F = m * a

where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

Next, let's consider the time derivative of the virial, which is the sum of the inner products of the position vector and the force for all molecules in the system. We can write this as:

d(Virial)/dt = d(∑(r * F))/dt

Using the product rule for differentiation, we can expand this expression as:

d(Virial)/dt = ∑(r * dF/dt) + ∑(F * dr/dt)

Now, we can apply Newton's second law to the second term in the summation:

F * dr/dt = m * a * dr/dt = m * (d²r/dt²) * dr/dt

Substituting this expression back into the equation for the time derivative of the virial, we get:

d(Virial)/dt = ∑(r * dF/dt) + ∑(m * (d²r/dt²) * dr/dt)

Now, we can apply the definition of kinetic energy, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of all molecules in the system. The kinetic energy of a single molecule is given by:

KE = (1/2) * m * (d²r/dt²)

So, the total kinetic energy of the system is:

KE_total = ∑(1/2) * m * (d²r/dt²)

Taking the time derivative of the total kinetic energy, we get:

d(KE_total)/dt = ∑(m * (d²r/dt²) * d²r/dt²)

Now, we can equate the time derivative of the virial to twice the time derivative of the total kinetic energy:

d(Virial)/dt = 2 * d(KE_total)/dt

This equation is the virial theorem. It states that the time average of the virial is equal to twice the total kinetic energy of the system. This theorem is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics and is used to study the behavior of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. 

In conclusion, the virial theorem is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of thermodynamic systems. It relates the time average of the virial to the total kinetic energy of the system, providing insights into the behavior of systems in equilibrium. By deriving this theorem from Newton's second law, we have shown that it is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics.",0.546

To derive the first integrals of motion, we need to use the given dynamical equation for each body. Let's start by deriving the first integrals of motion for the N-body system. The first integrals of motion are constants of motion that do not change over time. We will use the following steps to derive the first integrals of motion:

1. Identify the conserved quantities in the dynamical equation.
2. Express the conserved quantities in terms of the position and velocity vectors of the bodies.
3. Show that the conserved quantities are indeed constants of motion.

Let's start by identifying the conserved quantities in the dynamical equation. The dynamical equation for each body is given by:

$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$

The conserved quantities in this equation are the total linear momentum and the total energy of the system. The total linear momentum is the sum of the momenta of all the bodies, and the total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all the bodies.

The total linear momentum is given by:

$\mathbf{P}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{v}_{i}$

where $\mathbf{v}_{i}=\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ is the velocity vector of the $i$-th body.

The total energy is given by:

$E=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} v_{i}^{2} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$

where $v_{i}=\left|\mathbf{v}_{i}\right|$ is the speed of the $i$-th body.

Now, let's express the conserved quantities in terms of the position and velocity vectors of the bodies. The total linear momentum can be expressed as:

$\mathbf{P}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$

The total energy can be expressed as:

$E=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}^{2} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$

Now, let's show that the conserved quantities are indeed constants of motion. We will do this by showing that the time derivative of each conserved quantity is zero.

The time derivative of the total linear momentum is given by:

$\frac{d\mathbf{P}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}{dt}$

Using the dynamical equation, we can substitute the acceleration of the $i$-th body as:

$\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}{dt}=\frac{1}{m_{i} }\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

Substituting this expression into the time derivative of the total linear momentum, we get:

$\frac{d\mathbf{P}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

This expression is zero, since the sum of the forces on each body is zero. Therefore, the total linear momentum is a constant of motion.

The time derivative of the total energy is given by:

$\frac{dE}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{v}_{i} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}{dt} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \frac{\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}$

Using the dynamical equation, we can substitute the acceleration of the $i$-th body as:

$\frac{d\mathbf{v}_{i}{dt}=\frac{1}{m_{i} }\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

Substituting this expression into the time derivative of the total energy, we get:

$\frac{dE}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \frac{\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}$

This expression is zero, since the sum of the forces on each body is zero. Therefore, the total energy is a constant of motion.

In conclusion, the first integrals of motion for an N-body system are the total linear momentum and the total energy. These conserved quantities are constants of motion that do not change over time, and can be expressed in terms of the position and velocity vectors of the bodies. The derivation of these first integrals of motion is based on the given dynamical equation for each body, and shows that the total linear momentum and the total energy are conserved quantities in the N-body system.",0.714

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the gravitational force and the equation of motion for a satellite in orbit. The gravitational force between the satellite and the planet is given by $F = \frac{GmM}{d^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $M$ is the mass of the planet. The mass of the planet can be calculated using the formula $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\rho$. The equation of motion for the satellite in orbit is given by $\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$. By substituting the expression for $M$ into the equation of motion, we can relate the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet. Solving the equation of motion, we find that $P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2d^3}{GM}$. Substituting the expression for $M$, we get $P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2d^3}{G\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\rho}$. Simplifying this expression, we find that $P^2 = \frac{3d^3}{2GR^3\rho}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $P = \sqrt{\frac{3d^3}{2GR^3\rho}$. Therefore, the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet is $P = \sqrt{\frac{3d^3}{2GR^3\rho}$. This expression shows that the period of the satellite is directly proportional to the cube root of its distance to the center of the planet. The constant of proportionality depends on the gravitational constant $G$, the radius of the planet $R$, and the average density of the planet $\rho$. This relationship can be used to predict the period of a satellite orbiting a planet based on its distance from the planet's center.",0.637

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the rotational velocity of a galaxy, which is given by v = sqrt(GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius of the galaxy. We can also use the formula for the radial velocity dispersion of a galaxy, which is given by v = sqrt(3GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius of the galaxy. Since both galaxies have the same radius R and rotational velocity v, we can set up the following equation: sqrt(GM_A/R) = sqrt(GM_B/R) This simplifies to GM_A = GM_B.

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No," 

Here is the solution:

To find the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants, we first need to find the number density of electrons $n$. The total number of electrons in the star is given by the number of nuclei multiplied by the number of electrons per nucleus, which is equal to $Z$. Therefore, the number density of electrons is:

$n = \frac{Z}{V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$

Now, we can substitute this expression for $n$ into the formula for the electron degeneracy pressure:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}\right)^{5/3}$

The gravitational pressure is given by:

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V} = -\frac{\frac{3GM^2}{5R}}{3V} = -\frac{GM^2}{5V} = -\frac{GM^2}{5\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$

Since the electron degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational pressure, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

$pelectron = p_{grav}$

Substituting the expressions for $pelectron$ and $p_{grav$, we get:

$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}\right)^{5/3} = -\frac{GM^2}{5\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$

Now, we can solve for $R$:

$R = \left(\frac{3\pi^2}{5}\right)^{1/6}\frac{\hbar}{m_e}\left(\frac{Z}{GM}\right)^{1/3}$

Now, we can find the density value of the white dwarf:

$\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi}\left(\frac{5}{3\pi^2}\right)^{1/2}\frac{m_e^3}{\hbar^3}\left(\frac{GM}{Z}\right)^{3/2}$

This expression gives the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants. Note that $A$ does not appear in the final expression, as it cancels out in the calculation. The density of the white dwarf is a function of its total mass, atomic number, and fundamental constants.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

Conclude: 

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{m}_2) = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2}{r^3} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2}{r^3}$",No," 

To solve this problem, we first need to find the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ created by one of the dipoles and then use it to find the potential energy $U$ of the other dipole in this field. We can then use the formula for the potential energy to find the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ between the two dipoles.

The magnetic field $\vec{B}$ created by a dipole $\vec{m}$ is given by:

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the dipole to the point where the field is being calculated, and $r$ is the distance between the dipole and the point.

Now, we can use this formula to find the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ created by the dipole $\vec{m}_1$ at the location of the other dipole $\vec{m}_2$. We can then use this field to find the potential energy $U_2$ of the dipole $\vec{m}_2$ in the field created by $\vec{m}_1$:

$U_2 = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$

Since the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ is the sum of the potential energies of the two dipoles, we can write:

$U_{\text{int}} = U_1 + U_2$

where $U_1$ is the potential energy of the dipole $\vec{m}_1$ in the field created by $\vec{m}_2$. Since the two dipoles are identical, we can write:

$U_{\text{int}} = 2U_2$

Now, we can substitute the expression for $U_2$ into this equation:

$U_{\text{int}} = 2(-\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1)$

Since the two dipoles are identical, we can write:

$U_{\text{int}} = 2(-\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B}_2)$

where $\vec{B}_2$ is the magnetic field created by the dipole $\vec{m}_2$ at the location of the other dipole $\vec{m}_1$.

Now, we can substitute the expression for $\vec{B}_2$ into this equation:

$U_{\text{int}} = 2(-\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2}}{r^3})$

Since the two dipoles are identical, we can write:

$U_{\text{int}} = 2(-\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}}{r^3})$

Now, we can simplify this expression:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})^2 - (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$

This is the expression for the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$.

where $\mu_e$ is the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron and $\mu_p$ is the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton. 

Substituting the expressions for $\mu_e$ and $\mu_p$, we get:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi} \frac{3(\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e} \cdot \hat{r})^2 - (\frac{2.8e\hbar}{2m_p} \cdot \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e})}{r^3}$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi} \frac{3(\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e})^2 - \frac{2.8e^2\hbar^2}{4m_p m_e}}{r^3}$

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the forces acting on the electron. Since the electron is orbiting a proton, the primary force acting on it is the electrostatic force, also known as the Coulomb force. This force is given by the formula:

F = k * (e * q) / r^2

where k is the Coulomb constant, e is the electric charge of the electron, q is the electric charge of the proton, and r is the distance between the electron and the proton. Since the proton has a mass that is much greater than the electron, we can assume that the proton is stationary and only the electron is moving. Therefore, the centripetal force acting on the electron is equal to the electrostatic force:

F_c = m_e * v^2 / r

where v is the velocity of the electron. Setting the electrostatic force equal to the centripetal force, we get:

k * (e * q) / r^2 = m_e * v^2 / r

Solving for v, we get:

v = sqrt(k * (e * q) / m_e)

Now, we can find the orbital momentum of the electron using the formula:

L = m_e * v * r

Substituting the expression for v, we get:

L = m_e * sqrt(k * (e * q) / m_e) * r

Finally, we can find the total energy of the electron by considering both its kinetic energy and its potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

E_k = 1/2 * m_e * v^2

Substituting the expression for v, we get:

E_k = 1/2 * m_e * (k * (e * q) / m_e)

The potential energy is given by:

E_p = -k * (e * q) / r

Therefore, the total energy of the electron is:

E_total = E_k + E_p = 1/2 * m_e * (k * (e * q) / m_e) - k * (e * q) / r

Simplifying this expression, we get:

E_total = -k * (e * q) / r

This is the total energy of the electron in terms of its mass, the electric charge of the electron and proton, and the distance between them. The orbital momentum is given by:

L = m_e * sqrt(k * (e * q) / m_e) * r

This is the expression for the orbital momentum of the electron in terms of its mass, the electric charge of the electron and proton, and the distance between them. Therefore, the total energy and orbital momentum of the electron can be expressed as follows: 

Total Energy = -k * (e * q) / r
Orbital Momentum = m_e * sqrt(k * (e * q) / m_e) * r

where k is the Coulomb constant, e is the electric charge of the electron, q is the electric charge of the proton, m_e is the mass of the electron, and r is the distance between the electron and the proton. 

These expressions are derived under the assumption that the Coulombic attraction is the only force acting on the electron and that the proton has a mass that is much greater than the electron. 

The total energy is negative, which indicates that the electron is bound to the proton and cannot escape. The orbital momentum is a measure of the electron's angular momentum, which is conserved in this system.

For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,".

Here's the solution to the problem: To solve this problem, we will use the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. We will also use the formula for centripetal acceleration, which is given by $a_c = \frac{v^2}{R$, where $v$ is the velocity and $R$ is the radius of the circular orbit. Let's start by defining the variables. We have the mass of the Earth, $M$, the gravitational constant, $G$, the mass of the meteorite, $m_1$, and the mass of the space station, $m_2$. We also have the radius of the circular orbit, $R$, and the minimum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth, $R/2$. We will use the subscript 1 to denote the meteorite and the subscript 2 to denote the space station. (i) The speed of the meteorite just before the collision: To find the speed of the meteorite just before the collision, we will use the conservation of energy. The initial kinetic energy of the meteorite is given by $K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2$, where $v_1$ is the speed of the meteorite. The potential energy of the meteorite at a distance $R$ from the center of the Earth is given by $U_1 = -\frac{GMm_1}{R}$. The total energy of the meteorite is given by $E_1 = K_1 + U_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 - \frac{GMm_1}{R}$. After the collision, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of $R/2$ from the center of the Earth. The potential energy of the conglomerate at a distance $R/2$ from the center of the Earth is given by $U_2 = -\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2} = -\frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$. The total energy of the conglomerate is given by $E_2 = K_2 + U_2$, where $K_2$ is the kinetic energy of the conglomerate. Since the total energy is conserved, we have $E_1 = E_2$. Therefore, we can write $\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 - \frac{GMm_1}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_2^2 - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$, where $v_2$ is the speed of the conglomerate. Simplifying the equation, we get $v_1^2 = \frac{2GM}{R} + \frac{2Gm_2}{m_1}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R} + \frac{2Gm_2}{m_1}}$. This is the speed of the meteorite just before the collision. (ii) The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate: To find the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate, we will use the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the meteorite is given by $p_1 = m_1v_1$, and the initial momentum of the space station is given by $p_2 = m_2v_2 = 0$, since it is at rest. The final momentum of the conglomerate is given by $p_3 = (m_1 + m_2)v_3$, where $v_3$ is the speed of the conglomerate. Since the total momentum is conserved, we have $p_1 + p_2 = p_3$. Therefore, we can write $m_1v_1 = (m_1 + m_2)v_3$. Solving for $v_3$, we get $v_3 = \frac{m_1v_1}{m_1 + m_2}$. The speed of the conglomerate at the minimum distance $R/2$ from the center of the Earth is given by $v_{3,min} = \sqrt{\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$. The speed of the conglomerate at the maximum distance $R$ from the center of the Earth is given by $v_{3,max} = \sqrt{\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$. Therefore, the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate are given by $v_{3,min = \sqrt{\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$ and $v_{3,max} = \sqrt{\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$, respectively. (iii) The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth: The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is given by the radius of the circular orbit, which is $R$. Therefore, the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is $R$. Condition for the masses: For the scenario to be possible, the masses of the meteorite and the space station must obey the condition that the meteorite must be more massive than the space station. This is because the meteorite must have enough kinetic energy to overcome the gravitational potential energy of the space station and form a closed orbit with the space station. Therefore, the condition is $m_1 > m_2$. In conclusion, the speed of the meteorite just before the collision is given by $v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R} + \frac{2Gm_2}{m_1}}$, the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate are given by $v_{3,min} = \sqrt{\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$ and $v_{3,max} = \sqrt{\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}}$, respectively, and the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is $R$. The condition for the masses is $m_1 > m_2$.",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No," Here is the problem-solving process.

To show that the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, we need to consider the relationship between the apparent magnitude, the distance to the galaxy, and the solid angle subtended by the galaxy. The apparent magnitude (m) of a galaxy is related to its intrinsic luminosity (L) and distance (d) by the following equation: m = M + 5 log(d/10) where M is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy. The surface magnitude (μ) of a galaxy is defined as the magnitude of a certain solid angle (ω) of the galaxy, which is given by: μ = m - 2.5 log(ω) Now, let's consider two galaxies with the same intrinsic luminosity (L) and solid angle (ω), but at different distances (d1 and d2). We want to show that their surface magnitudes are the same. Using the first equation, we can write: m1 = M + 5 log(d1/10) m2 = M + 5 log(d2/10) Now, let's use the second equation to find the surface magnitudes of the two galaxies: μ1 = m1 - 2.5 log(ω) μ2 = m2 - 2.5 log(ω) Substituting the expressions for m1 and m2, we get: μ1 = (M + 5 log(d1/10) - 2.5 log(ω)) μ2 = (M + 5 log(d2/10) - 2.5 log(ω)) Since the solid angle (ω) is the same for both galaxies, the log(ω) term cancels out: μ1 = M + 5 log(d1/10) - 2.5 log(ω) μ2 = M + 5 log(d2/10) - 2.5 log(ω) Now, we can see that μ1 = μ2, which means that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe. This is because the apparent magnitude is affected by the distance, but the solid angle remains constant. Therefore, the surface magnitude is a more useful measure for comparing the brightness of galaxies, as it is independent of distance. The surface magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a galaxy per unit solid angle, and it is often used to study the properties of galaxies and their distribution in the universe. In summary, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, and it is a useful measure for comparing the brightness of galaxies. The apparent magnitude is affected by the distance, but the solid angle remains constant, which allows us to use the surface magnitude to study the properties of galaxies and their distribution in the universe.

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No," 

        # Problem Solving Process
To derive Kepler's laws based on the law of universal gravitation, we will follow these steps: 1. Start with the law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 2. Consider a planet orbiting a star. The planet's motion can be described by its position vector, velocity vector, and acceleration vector. 3. Apply the law of universal gravitation to the planet-star system. The force acting on the planet is given by F = G * (m_star * m_planet) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m_star is the mass of the star, m_planet is the mass of the planet, and r is the distance between the star and the planet. 4. Use Newton's second law of motion, F = m * a, to relate the force acting on the planet to its acceleration. This gives us a = G * (m_star / r^2). 5. Now, consider the planet's motion in a two-dimensional plane. The acceleration vector can be expressed as a = a_x * i + a_y * j, where i and j are the unit vectors in the x and y directions, respectively. 6. Since the force acting on the planet is always directed towards the star, the acceleration vector is also directed towards the star. This means that the x and y components of the acceleration vector are both negative, i.e., a_x < 0 and a_y < 0. 7. Differentiate the planet's position vector with respect to time to get the velocity vector. The velocity vector can be expressed as v = v_x * i + v_y * j, where v_x and v_y are the x and y components of the velocity vector, respectively. 8. Differentiate the velocity vector with respect to time to get the acceleration vector. This gives us a = a_x * i + a_y * j, where a_x and a_y are the x and y components of the acceleration vector, respectively. 9. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's motion is elliptical. This leads to Kepler's first law, which states that the planets orbit the sun in elliptical paths with the sun at one of the foci. 10. To derive Kepler's second law, consider the area swept out by the planet's position vector as it moves around its orbit. The rate of change of the area is given by dA/dt = (1/2) * (r_x * v_y - r_y * v_x). 11. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector. This means that the dot product of the velocity vector and the radius vector is zero, i.e., r * v = 0. 12. Differentiate the equation r * v = 0 with respect to time to get r * a + v * v = 0. 13. Substitute the expression for the acceleration vector from step 6 into the equation r * a + v * v = 0. This gives us r * (G * (m_star / r^2)) + v * v = 0. 14. Simplify the equation to get v^2 = G * (m_star / r). 15. Differentiate the equation v^2 = G * (m_star / r) with respect to time to get 2v * dv/dt = -G * (m_star / r^2) * dr/dt. 16. Use the chain rule to rewrite the equation as 2v * (dv/dt) = -G * (m_star / r^2) * (dr/dt). 17. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector. This means that the dot product of the velocity vector and the radius vector is zero, i.e., r * v = 0. 18. Differentiate the equation r * v = 0 with respect to time to get r * a + v * v = 0. 19. Substitute the expression for the acceleration vector from step 6 into the equation r * a + v * v = 0. This gives us r * (G * (m_star / r^2)) + v * v = 0. 20. Simplify the equation to get v^2 = G * (m_star / r). 21. Differentiate the equation v^2 = G * (m_star / r) with respect to time to get 2v * dv/dt = -G * (m_star / r^2) * dr/dt. 22. Use the chain rule to rewrite the equation as 2v * (dv/dt) = -G * (m_star / r^2) * (dr/dt). 23. Simplify the equation to get dv/dt = -G * (m_star / r^2) * (dr/dt). 24. Integrate the equation dv/dt = -G * (m_star / r^2) * (dr/dt) with respect to time to get v = -G * (m_star / r) * ln(r). 25. Differentiate the equation v = -G * (m_star / r) * ln(r) with respect to time to get a = -G * (m_star / r^2) * ln(r). 26. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's motion is elliptical. This leads to Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. 27. To derive Kepler's third law, consider the planet's motion in a two-dimensional plane. The area swept out by the planet's position vector as it moves around its orbit is given by A = (1/2) * r^2 * θ, where θ is the angle subtended by the radius vector at the center of the ellipse. 28. Differentiate the equation A = (1/2) * r^2 * θ with respect to time to get dA/dt = r^2 * (dθ/dt). 29. Since the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector, the rate of change of the angle θ is given by dθ/dt = v / r. 30. Substitute the expression for the velocity vector from step 7 into the equation dθ/dt = v / r. This gives us dθ/dt = v_x * i + v_y * j. 31. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's motion is elliptical. This means that the semi-major axis of the orbit is given by a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min), where r_max and r_min are the maximum and minimum distances between the planet and the star, respectively. 32. Differentiate the equation a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min) with respect to time to get da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). 33. Since the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector, the rate of change of the semi-major axis is given by da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). 34. Substitute the expression for the velocity vector from step 7 into the equation da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). This gives us da/dt = (1/2) * (v_x * i + v_y * j). 35. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's motion is elliptical. This means that the semi-major axis of the orbit is given by a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min), where r_max and r_min are the maximum and minimum distances between the planet and the star, respectively. 36. Differentiate the equation a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min) with respect to time to get da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). 37. Since the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector, the rate of change of the semi-major axis is given by da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). 38. Substitute the expression for the velocity vector from step 7 into the equation da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). This gives us da/dt = (1/2) * (v_x * i + v_y * j). 39. Since the acceleration vector is always directed towards the star, the planet's motion is elliptical. This means that the semi-major axis of the orbit is given by a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min), where r_max and r_min are the maximum and minimum distances between the planet and the star, respectively. 40. Differentiate the equation a = (1/2) * (r_max + r_min) with respect to time to get da/dt = (1/2) * (dr_max/dt + dr_min/dt). 41. Since the planet's velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector, the rate of change of the semi-major axis is given by da/dt = (1/2",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for the two cases.","According to: 

(I) The observed rotation curve is flat near the Sun. $V$ is constant $\rightarrow \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=0$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=0$

According to: 

(II) If the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at the centre, then we consider Keplerian motion. $V=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\to\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}.$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,".

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

# Solution

To solve this problem, we need to derive expressions for Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ in terms of the given parameters. We will first consider the case of the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy and then the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter.

## Actual Observed Rotation Curve

In the actual observed rotation curve, the line-of-sight velocity and transverse velocity components are given by:

$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

Using the small angle approximation, we can write:

$\sin l \approx l$
$\cos l \approx 1$

Substituting these approximations into the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$, we get:

$V_{r} \approx (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} l$
$V_{t} \approx (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0 - \Omega D$

Now, we can express the angular velocity difference as:

$\Omega - \Omega_{0} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}$

Substituting this into the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$, we get:

$V_{r} \approx \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0} l$
$V_{t} \approx \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0} - \Omega D$

Taking the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to the distance from the GC, we get:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$

Now, we can express the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun as:

$\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$

Substituting this into the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$, we get:

$V_{r} \approx \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} l$
$V_{t} \approx \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \Omega D$

Comparing these expressions with the first-order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, we can identify:

$A = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$
$B = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \Omega D$

## Hypothetical Scenario

In the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre, the rotation curve is flat, and the rotational velocity is constant. Therefore, the angular velocity is also constant, and we have:

$\Omega = \Omega_{0}$

In this case, the line-of-sight velocity and transverse velocity components are given by:

$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l = 0$
$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D = 0$

Since both $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$ are zero, we can see that the first-order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components does not apply in this case.

# Conclusion

In the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ can be expressed as:

$A = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$
$B = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \Omega D$

In the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter, the first-order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components does not apply, and the rotational velocity is constant.",0.728

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,".

# Solution

To solve this problem, we need to consider the mechanical energy of the gas element as it moves from $R_{max}$ to a smaller radius $r$. The mechanical energy per unit mass is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r
\]

where $v$ is the orbital velocity of the gas element, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the compact object, and $r$ is the radius of the orbit.

Since the gas element follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit, we can use the formula for the orbital velocity:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}
\]

Substituting this into the expression for the mechanical energy, we get:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r} \cdot \frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r} \cdot \frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} \cdot \frac{GM}{r}
\]

Now, we can simplify the expression further by canceling out the $G$ and $M$ terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r}
\]

Finally, we can simplify the expression to get the final answer:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{0} = 0
\]

So, the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element as it moves from $R_{max}$ to a smaller radius $r$ is zero. This is because the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and then into internal energy of the gas disc through viscous dissipation, resulting in no net change in mechanical energy.",0.728
23,"Magnetic fields in the Sun are constantly shaping the structure of various different features in the Solar atmosphere. Inside any feature, the magnetic field (B) adds to the total pressure exerted by the gas. This so-called magnetic pressure is a function of the height z and can be expressed as: ${P_{mag}}(z) = \frac{{B^2(z)}}{{2\mu_0}}$

25,"A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe.

To solve this problem, we will first need to understand the geometry of the situation. The distance between the Earth and the mirror is $D$, and the distance between the Earth and the Solar System is $s$. The separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, and we can express this as $S=se^{H_{0}t$. We are given that the separation $S$ is much smaller than the distance $D$, so we can use the approximation $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$. Therefore, we can express $S$ as $S=s(1+H_{0}t)$. The time $T$ it takes for the laser beam to travel from the Earth to the mirror and back is given by $T=2D/c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. The distance $D$ is related to the separation $S$ by the equation $D=S+s$. Substituting $S=s(1+H_{0}t)$ into this equation, we get $D=s(1+H_{0}t)+s$. Simplifying this equation, we get $D=2s+H_{0}st$. Substituting this expression for $D$ into the equation for $T$, we get $T=2(2s+H_{0}st)/c$. Simplifying this equation, we get $T=4s/c+2H_{0}st/c$. Since $t=T/2$, we can substitute this expression for $t$ into the equation for $S$, which gives us $S=s(1+H_{0}T/2c)$. Since $S$ is much smaller than $D$, we can use the approximation $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$, which gives us $S=s(1+H_{0}T/2c)$. Therefore, we can express the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ as a function of $D$, $c$, and $T$ as $H_{0}=\frac{2c}{ST}$. This expression is valid for small values of $S$ compared to $D$. Therefore, the expression for the Hubble constant $H_{0$ is given by $H_{0}=\frac{2c}{ST}$. This is the solution to the problem.",0.728

This expression is derived from the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, and the dimensions of $L_{GW}$ are $\frac{ML^{3}}{t^{3}$.

27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No," 

To solve this problem, we will first express the luminosity of gravitational waves $L_{GW}$ in terms of the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$. Then, we will use the given hint to find the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$.

The expression for the luminosity of gravitational waves is given by:

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5$

We want to find the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$. To do this, we can use the given hint:

$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1 \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$

Let $x = R$, then $\alpha = 5$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = 5R^4 \frac{L_{GW}}{2G^4 M^5 c^5}$

Now, we can substitute the expression for $L_{GW$ into the equation:

$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = 5R^4 \frac{\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}}{2G^4 M^5 c^5}$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2}{5R}$

This is the expression for the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$ in terms of the radius $R$. 

So, the answer is: $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2}{5R}$.
