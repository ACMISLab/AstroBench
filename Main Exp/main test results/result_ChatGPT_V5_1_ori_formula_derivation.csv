2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"We want to derive the virial theorem starting directly from Newton’s second law.

## 1. Setup and definitions

Consider a system of many particles (e.g., molecules in a gas or stars in a galaxy):

- Particle \(i\) has mass \(m_i\), position vector \(\mathbf{r}_i(t)\), and velocity \(\mathbf{v}_i = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\).
- The total force on particle \(i\) is \(\mathbf{F}_i\).

**Newton’s second law** for each particle:
\[
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i.
\]

Define the **virial** \(G\) as
\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{p}_i = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot (m_i \mathbf{v}_i),
\]
where \(\mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i\) is the momentum of particle \(i\).

---

## 2. Time derivative of the virial

Differentiate \(G\) with respect to time:

\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\sum_i m_i \,\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\right).
\]

The masses are constant, so
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i).
\]

Use the product rule for the scalar product:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i)
= \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i
= \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
= v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Therefore,
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \left(v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i\right).
\]

Split the sum:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i m_i v_i^2 + \sum_i m_i\,\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

1. The first term is twice the **total kinetic energy**:
   \[
   T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2T.
   \]

2. Use Newton’s second law for the second term:
   \[
   m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i \quad\Rightarrow\quad m_i\,\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i.
   \]
   Hence
   \[
   \sum_i m_i\,\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i.
   \]

So we get
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2T + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i.
\]

This is the **instantaneous** virial relation.

---

## 3. Time averaging and the virial theorem

Now take a time average over an interval \([0,\tau]\):
\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle
= \frac{1}{\tau}\int_0^\tau \frac{dG}{dt}\,dt 
= \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau}.
\]

If the system is **bound and in a steady or statistically stationary state** (e.g., a stable cluster, a relaxed galaxy, gas in a container), then \(G\) does not grow without bound, and for large \(\tau\),

\[
\lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau} = 0,
\]
so
\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0.
\]

Taking the time average of the earlier relation
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2T + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i,
\]
we obtain
\[
0 = \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 2\langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle.
\]

Thus the **virial theorem** is
\[
2\langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0.
\]

This is the general virial theorem derived from Newton’s second law.

---

## 4. Common special case: forces from a potential

If the forces come from a potential \(U\) that is a homogeneous function of degree \(n\) in the coordinates (i.e., \(U(\lambda \mathbf{r}) = \lambda^n U(\mathbf{r})\)), one can show
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -n U.
\]

Then the virial theorem becomes
\[
2\langle T \rangle - n \langle U \rangle = 0.
\]

For **Newtonian gravity**, \(U \propto r^{-1}\), which corresponds to \(n=-1\), giving
\[
2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0,
\]
the form widely used to estimate the masses of galaxies and clusters."

If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Group the terms pairwise for each unordered pair \((i,j)\) (with \(i \neq j\)):
For a given pair \((i,j)\),
the term from the sum over \(i\) is
\[
- \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
\]
and the term when indices are swapped \((j,i)\) is
\[
- \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
= - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)),
\]
so these two contributions cancel exactly.

Thus every pairwise interaction appears twice with opposite signs, so
\[
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0.
\]

Hence:
\[
\boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}.}
\]

---

## 2. Motion of the center of mass

Define the total mass and center of mass:
\[
M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i, \quad
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i.
\]

Then
\[
M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{P},
\]
and because \(\mathbf{P}\) is constant:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} = \text{constant}.
\]

Differentiating once more:
\[
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0.
\]

So the center of mass moves uniformly in a straight line:
\[
\boxed{\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) + \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}}(0)\, t.}
\]

This is another first integral: the center-of-mass motion separates as free motion.

---

## 3. Conservation of total angular momentum

Define the total angular momentum about the origin:
\[
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Differentiate:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} 
= \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i 
+ \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right).
\]

The first term vanishes because \(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0\), so
\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Insert the forces:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} =
\sum_{i=1}^N 
\mathbf{r}_i \times 
\left[
-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N 
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\right].
\]

Swap sums:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} =
-\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N 
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\left[ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\right].
\]

Again group terms by pairs \((i,j)\). For a given pair \((i,j)\), consider the contribution:
\[
\mathbf{T}_{ij} = 
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
-
\frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}
\mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i).
\]

Note that \(|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i| = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|\). Expand each cross product:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
= \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j
= - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j,
\]
since \(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i = 0\).

Similarly,
\[
\mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
= - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i
= \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
\]

Thus
\[
\mathbf{T}_{ij} =
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
= 0.
\]

So all pairwise torques cancel:
\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0.
\]

Hence:
\[
\boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}.}
\]

---

## 4. Conservation of total energy

The total kinetic energy is
\[
T = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2.
\]

The gravitational potential energy of the N-body system is
\[
U = - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
\]

Define the total energy:
\[
E = T + U.
\]

### Time derivative of the kinetic energy

Differentiate \(T\):
\[
\dot{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Use the equations of motion:
\[
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N 
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
\]
so
\[
\dot{T} = 
\sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot
\left[
-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N 
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\right].
\]

Swap sums:
\[
\dot{T} = 
- \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N 
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

### Time derivative of the potential energy

For a single pair \((i,j)\) with \(i < j\):
\[
U_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
\]

Let \(\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\). Then
\[
U_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|}.
\]

Differentiate:
\[
\dot{U}_{ij}
= -G m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt}\left(|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^{-1}\right)
= -G m_i m_j \left(-|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^{-3}\right) 
\frac{d}{dt} |\mathbf{r}_{ij}|.
\]

Using
\[
\frac{d}{dt}|\mathbf{r}_{ij}| 
= \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|}
= \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|},
\]
we get
\[
\dot{U}_{ij}
= G m_i m_j |\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^{-3}
\frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|}
= \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^3}
\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
\]

Now sum over all pairs \(i<j\):
\[
\dot{U}
= \sum_{1\le i<j\le N}
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
\]

### Combine \(\dot{T}\) and \(\dot{U}\)

Rewrite \(\dot{T}\) as a sum over unordered pairs. First, note:
\[
\dot{T} 
= -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^N
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Group terms with \(i<j\). For a given pair \((i,j)\):

- From the \(i\)-sum:
\[
- \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

- From the \(j\)-sum:
\[
- \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
= - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j))
= + \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Thus the combined contribution for pair \(i<j\) is
\[
\dot{T}_{ij} =
- \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
\left[
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
- \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\right]
=
- \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
\]

Hence
\[
\dot{T} =
\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}
\dot{T}_{ij}
=
-\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
\]

Compare with \(\dot{U}\):
\[
\dot{U}
= \sum_{1\le i<j\le N}
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
\]

We see:
\[
\dot{T} + \dot{U} = 0.
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(T+U) = 0,
\]
so the total energy is conserved:
\[
\boxed{
E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2
- \sum_{1\le i<j\le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
= \text{constant}.}
\]

---

## Summary of first integrals for the N-body Newtonian system

From the given equations of motion, the following first integrals are derived:

1. **Total linear momentum**  
   \[
   \boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}}
   \]

2. **Center-of-mass motion**  
   \[
   \boxed{\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0,
   \quad
   \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) + \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}}(0)\,t}
   \]

3. **Total angular momentum**  
   \[
   \boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}}
   \]

4. **Total mechanical energy**  
   \[
   \boxed{
   E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2
   - \sum_{1\le i<j\le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
   = \text{constant}}
   \]

These are the standard first integrals of motion for an isolated Newtonian N-body gravitational system."
9,"Try to prove that, for a celestial body in elliptical motion, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are respectively

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$","According to: 

Equation (i): For an elliptical orbit, when $f=0$ (periapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its minimum value: $r_{P}=\frac{p}{1+e}=a(1-e)$

Equation (ii): When $f=\pi$ (apoapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its maximum value: $r_{A}=\frac{p}{1-e}=a(1+e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

According to: 

From the vis-viva equation  $v=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}$

Conclude: 

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{P}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1-e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"We want the speed at perihelion and aphelion for an object moving in an ellipse around a focus under gravity with parameter \(\mu = GM\), semi-major axis \(a\), and eccentricity \(e\).

We’ll use two standard relations of Keplerian orbits:

1. **Radius at perihelion and aphelion**  
2. **Vis-viva equation**

---

## 1. Geometry of the ellipse: \(r_P\) and \(r_A\)

For an ellipse with semi-major axis \(a\) and eccentricity \(e\), the distance from the focus to the body is

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}
\]

where \(\theta\) is the true anomaly (angle from perihelion).

- At **perihelion**: \(\theta = 0\), so \(\cos\theta = 1\):

\[
r_P = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e} = a(1 - e)
\]

- At **aphelion**: \(\theta = \pi\), so \(\cos\theta = -1\):

\[
r_A = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1 + e)
\]

Thus:
\[
r_P = a(1 - e), \quad r_A = a(1 + e)
\]

---

## 2. Vis-viva equation

For any point on a Keplerian orbit:

\[
v^2 = \mu\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
\]

We apply this at perihelion and aphelion using the radii we just found.

---

## 3. Speed at perihelion \(v_P\)

At perihelion, \(r = r_P = a(1 - e)\):

\[
v_P^2 = \mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
\]

Factor \(\frac{1}{a}\):

\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2}{1 - e} - 1\right)
\]

Combine terms:

\[
\frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 = \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e}
= \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\]

So:

\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
\]

---

## 4. Speed at aphelion \(v_A\)

At aphelion, \(r = r_A = a(1 + e)\):

\[
v_A^2 = \mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
\]

Factor \(\frac{1}{a}\):

\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2}{1 + e} - 1\right)
\]

Combine terms:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 = \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e}
= \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
\]

So:

\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
\]

---

Thus the required expressions are proven:

\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, 
\qquad
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
\]"
10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"For a very long, uniformly dense cylinder, the gravitational field outside the cylinder falls off as \(1/d\), not \(1/d^2\) as with a spherical mass. We’ll derive the orbital period from that.

**1. Mass per unit length of the cylinder**

Let the cylinder have:
- radius \(R\)
- uniform density \(\rho\)

Treat it as infinitely long so that edge effects vanish. Consider a cross-sectional slice of thickness \(\mathrm{d}z\). Its mass is
\[
\mathrm{d}m = \rho \cdot \pi R^2 \,\mathrm{d}z
\]
Thus the mass per unit length (linear density) is
\[
\lambda = \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}z} = \rho \pi R^2.
\]

**2. Gravitational field outside an infinite cylinder**

For \(d > R\), use Gauss’s law for gravity in cylindrical symmetry. Take a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius \(d\) and length \(L\), coaxial with the planet.

- The enclosed mass is \(M_{\text{enc}} = \lambda L = \rho \pi R^2 L\).
- The gravitational field \(\vec{g}\) is radial and has the same magnitude at radius \(d\), so the flux through the curved surface is
  \[
  \Phi_g = g(d) \cdot 2\pi d L.
  \]

Gauss’s law for gravity says
\[
\oint \vec{g}\cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G\,M_{\text{enc}},
\]
so
\[
g(d) \cdot 2\pi d L = 4\pi G\,(\rho \pi R^2 L).
\]

Solving for \(g(d)\):
\[
g(d) = \frac{4\pi G\rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L}
= \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d},
\]
directed inward.

**3. Circular orbit condition**

For a circular orbit of radius \(d\) around the cylinder, the required centripetal acceleration is
\[
a_c = \frac{v^2}{d},
\]
and this must equal the gravitational acceleration \(g(d)\):
\[
\frac{v^2}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}.
\]

Cancel \(d\) from both sides:
\[
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2.
\]

Notice \(v\) is **independent** of \(d\): all circular orbits outside the cylinder have the same speed.

**4. Relating period \(P\) to distance \(d\)**

The period is the orbital circumference divided by speed:
\[
P = \frac{\text{orbit circumference}}{\text{speed}}
= \frac{2\pi d}{v}.
\]

Since \(v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}\), we get
\[
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}}.
\]

So the period grows linearly with distance:
\[
\boxed{P(d) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}}\; d.}
\]

Equivalently, you can write
\[
P(d) \propto d,
\]
with the proportionality constant depending on \(G, \rho,\) and \(R\)."
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

According to: 

The velocity distribution in an elliptical galaxy is uniform and random. Then, we can use the Virial theorem ($T=-U/2$) to calculate the velocity at the edge of the galaxy.

Conclude: 

$1/2Mv_{tot}^{2}=\frac{3}{10}\frac{GM^{2}}{R}\Longrightarrow M=\frac{5}{3}\frac{v_{tot}^{2}R}{G}$

According to: 

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"We’ll treat each galaxy as a self-gravitating system in equilibrium and use the appropriate dynamical relation to infer its mass from the given velocity scale at radius \(R\).

---

## 1. Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy with Rotational Velocity \(v\)

At radius \(R\), we are told the circular (rotational) velocity is \(v\). For a test mass in a circular orbit around a mass distribution that is approximately spherically symmetric interior to \(R\), the condition for circular motion is:

\[
\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M_A(R)}{R^2}
\]

where:
- \(M_A(R)\) is the mass enclosed within radius \(R\),
- \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

Rearrange to solve for the mass:

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M_A(R)}{R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
M_A(R) = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

If we interpret \(R\) as the full “edge” of the galaxy and assume most of the mass is within this radius, then the total mass of Galaxy A is approximately:

\[
\boxed{M_A \approx \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
\]

---

## 2. Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy with Radial Velocity Dispersion \(v\)

Galaxy B is:
- Spherical,
- Elliptical,
- Uniform density (evenly spaced stars),
- Has a **radial velocity dispersion** \(\sigma_r = v\) at radius \(R\).

We’ll use the (scalar) virial theorem for a self-gravitating system in equilibrium:
\[
2K + U = 0
\]

### 2.1. Kinetic Energy

For an isotropic velocity dispersion (same in all directions), the three-dimensional velocity dispersion is:

\[
\langle v^2 \rangle = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_\theta^2 + \sigma_\phi^2 = 3\sigma^2
\]

If \(\sigma_r = \sigma = v\), then:
\[
\langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2
\]

The total kinetic energy for \(N\) stars of mass \(m\) (total mass \(M_B = Nm\)) is:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} M_B (3 v^2) = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2
\]

### 2.2. Potential Energy of a Uniform Sphere

For a sphere of total mass \(M_B\) and radius \(R\) with **uniform density**, the gravitational potential energy is:

\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]

### 2.3. Apply the Virial Theorem

Use \(2K + U = 0\):

\[
2K + U = 0
\Rightarrow 2\left(\frac{3}{2} M_B v^2\right) - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]

Cancel the 3 and one factor of \(M_B\):

\[
M_B v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}
\]

Solve for \(M_B\):

\[
M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
\]

So the total mass of the spherical elliptical galaxy is:

\[
\boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
\]

---

## 3. Summary

- Spiral galaxy (A), using circular orbit dynamics at radius \(R\):
  \[
  \boxed{M_A \approx \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
  \]

- Uniform-density spherical elliptical galaxy (B), using the virial theorem with radial velocity dispersion \(v\):
  \[
  \boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
  \]

So, for the same \(v\) at radius \(R\), the uniform spherical elliptical (Galaxy B) must be about 5 times more massive than the spiral (Galaxy A) under these idealized assumptions."
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

---

### 1. Electron degeneracy pressure

For a cold, non‑relativistic Fermi gas of electrons, the degeneracy pressure is  
\[
p_e \;=\; \frac{2}{3}u \;=\; \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n_e^{5/3},
\]
where  
- \(m_e\) = electron mass  
- \(n_e\) = electron number density.

---

### 2. Gravitational pressure

The gravitational potential energy of a uniform-density sphere of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\) is
\[
\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}.
\]
The “gravitational pressure” is given by
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V},
\]
and the volume of the star is
\[
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3.
\]

Compute \(p_{\text{grav}}\):
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{-3GM^2/(5R)}{3 \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
= \frac{3GM^2}{5R} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi R^3}
= \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}.
\]

---

### 3. Relate electron density to mass density

Assume the star has nuclei with atomic number \(Z\) and mass number \(A\). Each nucleus contributes \(Z\) electrons (for charge neutrality) and has mass \(\approx A m_p\) (using proton mass \(m_p\) as nucleon mass).

- Number density of nuclei: \(n_N\).
- Then electron number density:
  \[
  n_e = Z\,n_N.
  \]
- Mass density:
  \[
  \rho = n_N \, A m_p \quad\Rightarrow\quad n_N = \frac{\rho}{A m_p}.
  \]
Thus
\[
n_e = Z \frac{\rho}{A m_p} = \frac{Z}{A m_p}\,\rho.
\]

---

### 4. Express quantities in terms of mass density \(\rho\)

The average density is
\[
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \quad\Rightarrow\quad
R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}.
\]

Hence
\[
R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3},
\]
and
\[
R^4 = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{4/3}.
\]

---

### 5. Write \(p_e\) and \(p_{\text{grav}}\) in terms of \(\rho\) and set them equal

Electron degeneracy pressure:
\[
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\rho\right)^{5/3}.
\]

Gravitational pressure:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
= \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3M}\right)^{4/3}.
\]

Equilibrium requires \(p_e = p_{\text{grav}}\):

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\rho\right)^{5/3}
=
\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3M}\right)^{4/3}.
\]

---

### 6. Solve this equation for \(\rho\)

First, separate \(\rho\)-dependence:

Left side: \(\propto \rho^{5/3}\).  
Right side: \(\propto \rho^{4/3}\).

So we can divide by \(\rho^{4/3}\) and get a linear equation in \(\rho^{1/3}\):

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3}\rho^{5/3}
=
\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3M}\right)^{4/3}\rho^{4/3}.
\]

Divide both sides by \(\rho^{4/3}\):

\[
\rho^{1/3} \,\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3}
=
\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3M}\right)^{4/3}.
\]

Thus
\[
\rho^{1/3} =
\frac{\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3M}\right)^{4/3}}
{\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3}}.
\]

Now simplify the mass dependence:

\[
\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3M}\right)^{4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3} M^{-4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

So
\[
\rho^{1/3} = 
\frac{3G}{20\pi} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}
\;\bigg/\;
\left[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3}
\right].
\]

Invert the denominator:

\[
\rho^{1/3} =
\left[\frac{3G}{20\pi} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}\right]
\cdot
\left[\frac{5m_e}{\hbar^2} (3\pi^2)^{-2/3} \left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^{5/3}\right].
\]

Combine constants and then cube:

\[
\rho =
\left\{
\frac{3G}{20\pi} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3}
\frac{5m_e}{\hbar^2} (3\pi^2)^{-2/3}
\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^{5/3}
\right\}^3
M^2.
\]

So the density scales as \(\rho \propto M^2\) for a non‑relativistic degenerate white dwarf of fixed composition.

---

### 7. Final expression

A compact final result for the density of a white dwarf (uniform-density, non‑relativistic, supported purely by electron degeneracy) is:

\[
\boxed{
\rho(M,A,Z)
=
\left[
\frac{3G}{20\pi} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{4/3}
\frac{5m_e}{\hbar^2} (3\pi^2)^{-2/3}
\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^{5/3}
\right]^3
M^2
}
\]

- \(G\) is the gravitational constant,  
- \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant,  
- \(m_e\) is the electron mass,  
- \(m_p\) is the proton mass,

13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

Conclude: 

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{m}_2) = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2}{r^3} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2}{r^3}$",No,"The interaction energy is just the potential energy of one dipole in the magnetic field created by the other:

\[
U_\text{int} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1

where \(\vec{B}_1\) is the field of dipole \(\vec{m}_1\) at the location of \(\vec{m}_2\).

1. Magnetic field of dipole \(\vec{m}_1\):

\[
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
\]

2. Plug into the potential energy expression:

U_\text{int} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1

### 1. Forces and speed of the circular orbit

Coulomb’s law gives the attractive force between proton and electron (magnitudes only):

\[
F_{\text{Coul}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\]

For a circular orbit of radius \(r\), the centripetal force on the electron must equal this Coulomb force:

\[
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\]

Solve for the orbital speed \(v\):

\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}
\]

---

### 2. Potential and kinetic energy

The electric potential energy (electron-proton) is

\[
U(r) = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

The kinetic energy of the electron is

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2
    = \frac{1}{2} m_e \left(\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}\right)
    = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}

---

### 3. Total energy of the electron

Total energy \(E\) is

\[
E = K + U
  = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
    - \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
  = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

So

\[
\boxed{E = - \frac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}}
\]

---

### 4. Orbital angular momentum of the electron

The orbital angular momentum (about the proton) is

\[
L = m_e v r
\]

Using the expression for \(v\):

\[
L = m_e r \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r}}
  = \sqrt{m_e r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}}
  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} m_e e^2 r}
\]

Thus

\[
\boxed{L = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\, m_e e^2 r}}
\]

These are the classical expressions for the total energy and orbital angular momentum of the electron under pure Coulomb attraction, with the proton taken as fixed."
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"We’ll go step by step, using:

- Earth mass: \(M\)  
- Gravitational constant: \(G\)  
- Meteorite mass: \(m_1\)  
- Space station mass: \(m_2\)  
- Initial station orbit radius: \(R\)

---

## 1. Initial facts: Station and meteorite

### Space station

It orbits circularly at radius \(R\). Circular orbit speed:

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]

This is tangential to the orbit.

### Meteorite

It is “radially approaching” Earth. At the collision moment it is at radius \(R\) with purely radial velocity (directed inward).

Define the direction:
- Let the station velocity be along the \(+\hat{\theta}\) (tangential) direction.
- The meteorite velocity at collision is along \(-\hat{r}\) (radially inward).

Let its speed just before collision be \(v_1\).

---

## 2. Orbit of the conglomerate

After collision, the meteorite and station stick together (perfectly inelastic collision) forming a conglomerate of mass

\[
m = m_1 + m_2.
\]

Because gravity is central, the **total angular momentum about Earth’s center is conserved** during the collision (there is no external torque). The post-collision orbit is required in the problem to be **closed and with minimum distance \(R/2\)** from Earth’s center. 

A bound, closed Keplerian orbit with two distinct distances from the focus is an **ellipse**. So:

**Shape of the orbit:** Elliptical orbit around Earth.

We will see that the collision point \(r = R\) becomes the **apocenter** (farthest point), and the pericenter is \(r_{\min} = R/2\).

Thus:
- Pericenter: \(r_p = \frac{R}{2}\)  
- Apocenter: \(r_a = R\)

The semi-major axis of this ellipse is
\[
a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} = \frac{\frac{R}{2} + R}{2} = \frac{3R}{4}.
\]

The eccentricity \(e\) can be found from
\[
r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e).
\]

Using \(r_a = R\) and \(a = 3R/4\):
\[
R = \frac{3R}{4}(1+e) \implies 1+e = \frac{4}{3} \implies e = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Consistently, \(r_p = a(1-e) = \frac{3R}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{3} = \frac{R}{2}\).

---

## 3. Angular momentum conservation → Post-collision tangential speed

At the collision point (radius \(R\)), the meteorite has **no tangential component** (purely radial). The only tangential momentum comes from the station.

- Initial angular momentum (about Earth’s center):

\[
L_{\text{initial}} = m_2 \, v_2 \, R = m_2 \, \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \, R = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}.
\]

- After the collision, the conglomerate (mass \(m_1 + m_2\)) has tangential speed \(v_t\) at radius \(R\). So

\[
L_{\text{final}} = (m_1 + m_2) v_t R.
\]

Conservation of angular momentum \(L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}}\):

\[
m_2 \sqrt{GMR} = (m_1 + m_2) v_t R.
\]

Solve for \(v_t\):

\[
v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \frac{\sqrt{GMR}}{R}
    = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
\]

At the collision point, the conglomerate’s velocity is tangential (radial components of the two masses cancel in the inelastic sticking process), so:

\[
v_{\text{cong, at } r=R} = v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
\]

We will identify this with either the pericenter or apocenter speed of the resulting ellipse.

---

## 4. Elliptical orbit speeds at pericenter and apocenter

For a bound Keplerian orbit around mass \(M\), the speed at radius \(r\) is

\[
v^2 = GM\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right).
\]

Apply this to our ellipse (\(a = 3R/4\)) at the two extreme points:

### Apocenter (r = R)

\[
v_a^2 = GM\left(\frac{2}{R} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
      = GM\left(\frac{2}{R} - \frac{4}{3R}\right)
      = GM\left(\frac{6 - 4}{3R}\right)
      = GM\cdot\frac{2}{3R}.
\]

So
\[
v_a = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}}.
\]

### Pericenter (r = R/2)

\[
v_p^2 = GM\left(\frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
      = GM\left(\frac{4}{R} - \frac{4}{3R}\right)
      = GM\cdot\frac{12 - 4}{3R}
      = GM\cdot\frac{8}{3R}.
\]

So
\[
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{8GM}{3R}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}} = 2v_a.
\]

In an ellipse with \(r_p < r_a\), the **minimum** speed is at the apocenter and the **maximum** speed is at the pericenter, so

- Minimum speed: \(v_{\min} = v_a = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}}\)
- Maximum speed: \(v_{\max} = v_p = \sqrt{\frac{8GM}{3R}}\)

Since the collision happens at \(r = R\), which is the larger radius, the conglomerate at that point is at the **apocenter** with speed \(v_a\). Thus,

\[
v_{\text{cong at collision}} = v_a = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}}.
\]

Equate this to the angular-momentum-based expression:

\[
\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}}.
\]

Solve:

\[
\left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{3}
\;\Rightarrow\;
\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.
\]

Hence

\[
m_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}(m_1 + m_2)
\;\Rightarrow\;
m_2 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\,m_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\,m_1
\]

\[
m_2 \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\,m_1.
\]

So the mass relation is

\[
\boxed{\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}}
= \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1.}
\]

This is the condition that \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) must obey for the specified elliptical orbit (with pericenter \(R/2\)) to result.

## 5. Speed of the meteorite before collision

Use **energy conservation** from “just before collision” to “just after collision.” The collision is inelastic, so kinetic energy is not conserved, but total mechanical energy of each object with Earth is conserved up to the collision instant. We equate the **total orbital energy right before** and **right after** the collision (relative to Earth).

### Initial total energy (before collision)

- Station \(m_2\) in circular orbit at radius \(R\):
  
  \[
  E_{2,\text{initial}} = -\frac{GMm_2}{2R}.
  \]
  (standard result for a circular orbit)

- Meteorite \(m_1\) at radius \(R\) with radial speed \(v_1\): total energy is

  \[
  E_{1,\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 - \frac{GM m_1}{R}.
  \]

Total initial energy:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 - \frac{GM m_1}{R} - \frac{GM m_2}{2R}.
\]

### Final total energy (immediately after collision)

After collision, the conglomerate (mass \(m = m_1 + m_2\)) is at radius \(R\) with tangential speed \(v_a = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{3R}}\), so its total orbital energy is

\[
E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_a^2 - \frac{GM (m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

Compute \(v_a^2 = \frac{2GM}{3R}\):

\[
E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)\cdot\frac{2GM}{3R} - \frac{GM (m_1 + m_2)}{R}
= \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R} - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

\[
E_{\text{final}} = GM(m_1 + m_2)\left(\frac{1}{3R} - \frac{1}{R}\right)
= -\frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

### Energy conservation at collision

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}.
\]

So:

\[
\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 - \frac{GM m_1}{R} - \frac{GM m_2}{2R}
= -\frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

Multiply by \(2\):

\[
m_1 v_1^2 - \frac{2GM m_1}{R} - \frac{GM m_2}{R}
= -\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

Bring terms involving \(GM/R\) together:

Left side’s potential terms:

\[
-\frac{2GM m_1}{R} - \frac{GM m_2}{R}
= -\frac{GM}{R}(2m_1 + m_2).
\]

Right side:

\[
-\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

Thus:

\[
m_1 v_1^2 - \frac{GM}{R}(2m_1 + m_2)
= -\frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

Move the potential term to the right:

\[
m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R}(2m_1 + m_2) - \frac{4GM(m_1 + m_2)}{3R}.
\]

Factor \(\frac{GM}{R}\):

\[
m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R}\left[(2m_1 + m_2) - \frac{4}{3}(m_1 + m_2)\right].
\]

Compute the bracket:

\[
(2m_1 + m_2) - \frac{4}{3}(m_1 + m_2)
= 2m_1 + m_2 - \frac{4}{3}m_1 - \frac{4}{3}m_2
= \left(2 - \frac{4}{3}\right)m_1 + \left(1 - \frac{4}{3}\right)m_2
= \frac{2}{3}m_1 - \frac{1}{3}m_2
= \frac{1}{3}(2m_1 - m_2).
\]

So:

\[
m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{3}(2m_1 - m_2)
= \frac{GM}{3R}(2m_1 - m_2).
\]

Thus:

\[
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{3R}\frac{2m_1 - m_2}{m_1}.
\]

So the meteorite speed just before collision is:

\[
\boxed{
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{3R}\,\frac{2m_1 - m_2}{m_1}}.
}
\]

For this to be real (and positive), we need \(2m_1 - m_2 > 0\), i.e.

\[
m_2 < 2m_1.
\]

But we already have the **specific mass relation** from the orbit requirement:

\[
\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1,
\]

which automatically satisfies \(m_2 < 2m_1\). Under that condition, the expression for \(v_1\) is consistent.

You can, if desired, substitute \(m_1/m_2 = \sqrt{3/2} - 1\) into \(v_1\) to write it purely in terms of \(m_2\), but the problem only asks for \(v_1\) in terms of \(m_1, m_2, M, G\), so the boxed form above is sufficient.

---

## 6. Summary of answers

}

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"We want to show that, in a non-expanding (static, Euclidean) universe, the *surface magnitude* of a galaxy (its brightness per unit solid angle on the sky) does not depend on how far away it is.

We will proceed step by step.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Total flux** \(F\): energy received per unit area per unit time from an object.
- **Apparent magnitude** \(m\): related to the flux by  
  \[
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} F + \text{constant}.
  \]
- **Surface brightness** (in flux units): flux per unit solid angle, i.e.
  \[
  I \equiv \frac{F}{\Omega},
  \]
  where \(\Omega\) is the solid angle subtended by the galaxy on the sky.
- **Surface magnitude**: the magnitude corresponding to the surface brightness, typically expressed in mag/arcmin\(^2\) or mag/arcsec\(^2\).

We need to see how \(I\) (and therefore the surface magnitude) depends on the distance \(d\) to the galaxy.

---

## 2. Scaling of flux with distance

Assume a galaxy has total luminosity \(L\) (energy emitted per unit time), and the universe is static and Euclidean (no expansion, no cosmological redshift, no relativistic effects). Then the flux at distance \(d\) is given by the inverse-square law:

\[
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}.
\]

So total observed flux drops as \(1/d^2\).

---

## 3. Angular size and solid angle

Let the galaxy have some physical (projected) area \(A\) perpendicular to the line of sight. For simplicity we can think of its “face-on” area, but the argument holds generally.

The solid angle \(\Omega\) that this area subtends at distance \(d\) is

\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2},
\]

assuming small-angle approximation (valid for distant galaxies) and Euclidean geometry: linear size \(\propto d\), so area \(\propto d^2\), and solid angle is area divided by distance squared.

Thus, like the flux, the solid angle also scales as \(1/d^2\).

---

## 4. Surface brightness in flux units

The observed surface brightness is the flux per unit solid angle:

\[
I = \frac{F}{\Omega}.
\]

Now plug in the expressions for \(F\) and \(\Omega\):

\[
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}, \qquad \Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}.
\]

So

\[
I = \frac{F}{\Omega}
  = \frac{\dfrac{L}{4\pi d^2}}{\dfrac{A}{d^2}}
  = \frac{L}{4\pi A}.
\]

The \(d^2\) in numerator and denominator cancel exactly. Therefore,

\[
I = \frac{L}{4\pi A},
\]

which depends only on the intrinsic luminosity per unit area of the galaxy, not on its distance.

So the *surface brightness in physical units* (e.g. W·m\(^{-2}\)·sr\(^{-1}\)) is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe.

---

## 5. Surface magnitude independence

Magnitude is just a logarithmic measure of flux. The surface magnitude \(\mu\) (e.g. in mag/arcmin\(^2\)) corresponds to the surface brightness \(I\) via

\[
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} I + \text{constant}.
\]

Since \(I\) is independent of \(d\), the surface magnitude \(\mu\) is also independent of the distance to the galaxy.

Thus, in a non-expanding (static) universe, the surface magnitude of a galaxy does not depend on how far away it is.

*(In contrast, in our real expanding universe, cosmological effects — redshift, time dilation, and angular-diameter distance — cause the observed surface brightness to decrease with redshift, leading to the Tolman surface-brightness dimming \(\propto (1+z)^4\).)*"
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"I’ll derive Kepler’s three laws for a planet of mass \(m\) moving around a much more massive star of mass \(M\) (so we can treat the star as fixed at the origin).

We start with Newton’s law of universal gravitation plus Newton’s second law, then show:

1. The orbit is a conic section (ellipse) with the star at a focus (Kepler’s 1st law).
2. The line from the star to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Kepler’s 2nd law).
3. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (Kepler’s 3rd law).

---

## 1. Setup: Newton’s Law and Equation of Motion

Newton’s law of gravitation: the gravitational force on the planet is
\[
\vec{F} = -\,G\frac{Mm}{r^2}\,\hat{r},
\]
where
- \(G\) is the gravitational constant,
- \(r\) is the distance between star and planet,
- \(\hat{r}\) is the radial unit vector pointing from star to planet.

Newton’s second law: \(\vec{F} = m\vec{a}\). Thus
\[
m\vec{a} = -\,G\frac{Mm}{r^2}\,\hat{r}.
\]
Cancel \(m\):
\[
\vec{a} = \ddot{\vec{r}} = -\,\frac{GM}{r^2}\,\hat{r}.
\]

This is a central force (always along the line joining the bodies and depends only on \(r\)). We work in plane polar coordinates \((r,\theta)\) in the orbital plane.

---

## 2. Kepler’s Second Law from Central Force (Conservation of Angular Momentum)

### 2.1 Angular momentum conservation

The torque about the star is
\[
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}.
\]
But \(\vec{F} \parallel \vec{r}\) (gravity acts along the radius), so \(\vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0\). Therefore
\[
\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = \vec{\tau} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \vec{L} = \text{constant},
\]
where \(\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m\vec{v}\) is the orbital angular momentum.

Magnitude of angular momentum per unit mass:
\[
h \equiv \frac{|\vec{L}|}{m} = r^2\dot{\theta} = \text{constant}.
\]

### 2.2 Area sweep rate

Position vector in polar coordinates: \(\vec{r} = r\,\hat{r}\).

The areal velocity (area swept per unit time) of the radius vector is
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}.
\]
But \(r^2\dot{\theta} = h\) is constant, hence
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}.
\]

That is precisely Kepler’s **Second Law**:  
**The radius vector from the star to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.**

We got this directly from the fact that gravitational force is central (radial), hence angular momentum is conserved.

---

## 3. Kepler’s First Law: Orbits Are Ellipses (Conic Sections)

Now we solve the equation of motion under an inverse-square central force and show the trajectory is a conic section. The bound case (negative total energy) will be an ellipse.

### 3.1 Radial equation in polar coordinates

Express the motion in planar polar coordinates. The acceleration in polar coordinates is
\[
\ddot{\vec{r}} = (\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2)\,\hat{r} + (r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta})\,\hat{\theta}.
\]

The gravitational acceleration is purely radial:
\[
\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}\,\hat{r}.
\]

Equate components:

- Radial component:
\[
\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}.
\]
- Transverse (angular) component:
\[
r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0.
\]

The angular component is equivalent to conservation of \(h = r^2\dot{\theta} = \text{constant}\) (we already used this).

We now use \(h = r^2\dot{\theta}\) to eliminate time in favor of \(\theta\).

### 3.2 Binet’s substitution: \(u(\theta) = \frac{1}{r}\)

Define
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{1}{r}.
\]

We want to rewrite the radial equation in terms of \(u(\theta)\). First note:
\[
\dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2} = h u^2.
\]

We need \(\ddot{r}\) and \(\dot{r}\) in terms of derivative w.r.t. \(\theta\). Start with
\[
r = \frac{1}{u}.
\]

Differentiate w.r.t. time using chain rule:

1. First derivative:
\[
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta}\frac{d\theta}{dt}
= \left(-\frac{1}{u^2}\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}
= -\frac{1}{u^2}u' \cdot (h u^2)
= -h\,u',
\]
where \(u' \equiv \frac{du}{d\theta}\).

2. Second derivative:
\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{d\dot{r}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(-h u')
= -h \frac{d u'}{dt}
= -h \frac{du'}{d\theta}\frac{d\theta}{dt}
= -h u'' \dot{\theta}
= -h u'' (h u^2)
= -h^2 u^2 u'',
\]
where \(u'' \equiv \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2}\).

Also,
\[
r\dot{\theta}^2 = \frac{1}{u} (h u^2)^2 = \frac{1}{u} h^2 u^4 = h^2 u^3.
\]

Now plug into the radial equation:
\[
\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}.
\]

Left-hand side:
\[
\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = (-h^2 u^2 u'') - (h^2 u^3).
\]

Right-hand side:
\[
-\frac{GM}{r^2} = -GM u^2.
\]

So:
\[
-h^2 u^2 u'' - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2.
\]

Divide through by \(-h^2 u^2\) (nonzero for nontrivial motion):
\[
u'' + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}.
\]

This is Binet’s equation for an inverse-square central force.

### 3.3 Solution: conic section in polar form

The differential equation
\[
u'' + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]
is linear with constant coefficients. The general solution is
\[
u(\theta) = u_p + u_h,
\]
where:
- Particular solution: \(u_p = \frac{GM}{h^2}\) (constant).
- Homogeneous solution of \(u'' + u = 0\): \(u_h = A\cos(\theta - \theta_0)\) or equivalently \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\).

So:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A\cos(\theta - \theta_0).
\]

We can choose the origin of \(\theta\) so that \(\theta_0 = 0\) (aligning the polar axis with periapsis). Then
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A\cos\theta.
\]

Define eccentricity \(e\) and semi-latus rectum \(p\) by:
\[
\frac{GM}{h^2} = \frac{1}{p}, \quad A = \frac{e}{p}.
\]
Then
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{1}{p}(1 + e\cos\theta).
\]

Therefore:
\[
r(\theta) = \frac{1}{u(\theta)} = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta}.
\]

This is exactly the polar equation of a conic section (with focus at the origin):

- \(0 \le e < 1\): ellipse (bound orbit).
- \(e = 1\): parabola.
- \(e > 1\): hyperbola (unbound trajectory).

For gravitationally bound planets, the total energy is negative, which corresponds to \(0 \le e < 1\): **elliptical orbits**.

Thus we have Kepler’s **First Law**:  
**The orbit of a planet under Newtonian gravity is an ellipse with the star at one focus.**

---

## 4. Kepler’s Third Law: \(T^2 \propto a^3\)

Now we relate the orbital period \(T\) to the size of the ellipse (its semi-major axis \(a\)).

### 4.1 Relate angular momentum, area, and period

From equal areas in equal times, the total area of the ellipse is covered in one orbital period \(T\). For an ellipse with semi-major axis \(a\) and semi-minor axis \(b\),
\[
\text{Area} = \pi a b.
\]

The areal velocity is
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2},
\]
so over one period
\[
A = \frac{dA}{dt} T = \frac{h}{2} T.
\]

Equate:
\[
\pi a b = \frac{h}{2} T \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = \frac{2\pi a b}{h}.
\]

So
\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{h^2}.
\]

We need to express \(b\) and \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(GM\).

### 4.2 Geometric relations for the ellipse

For an ellipse with semi-major axis \(a\), semi-minor axis \(b\), and eccentricity \(e\):
\[
b^2 = a^2 (1 - e^2).
\]

Earlier, we found the orbital equation
\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta}, \quad p = \frac{h^2}{GM}.
\]
For an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum \(p\) is related to \(a\) and \(e\) by
\[
p = a(1 - e^2).
\]

Combine:
\[
p = \frac{h^2}{GM} = a(1 - e^2).
\]
Therefore
\[
h^2 = GM\,a(1 - e^2).
\]

Also:
\[
b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2).
\]

### 4.3 Eliminate \(e\) and \(b\) in favor of \(a\)

Compute \(a^2 b^2\):
\[
a^2 b^2 = a^2 \cdot a^2 (1 - e^2) = a^4 (1 - e^2).
\]

But from above:
\[
1 - e^2 = \frac{h^2}{GM\,a}.
\]
So
\[
a^2 b^2 = a^4 \cdot \frac{h^2}{GM\,a} = \frac{a^3 h^2}{GM}.
\]

Plug into the expression for \(T^2\):
\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{h^2}
= \frac{4\pi^2}{h^2} \cdot \frac{a^3 h^2}{GM}
= \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3.
\]

Thus:
\[
\boxed{T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3.}
\]

For a given central mass \(M\), the factor \(\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\) is constant, so:

**Kepler’s Third Law:**  
**The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:**
\[
T^2 \propto a^3.
\]

## 5. Summary: Kepler’s Laws from Newton’s Gravitation

Starting from Newton’s law of gravitation and \(F = ma\):

1. **Second Law (Equal Areas):**  
   The gravitational force is central (along radius vector), so torque is zero and angular momentum is conserved. This implies \(r^2\dot{\theta} = \text{const}\), hence areal velocity \(\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}\) is constant: equal areas in equal times.

2. **First Law (Elliptical Orbits):**  
   Solving the equation of motion in polar coordinates for an inverse-square central force leads to
   \[
   r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta},
   \]
   the polar equation of a conic with focus at the force center. For bound motion (negative energy) the conic is an ellipse, with the star at a focus.

3. **Third Law (Period–Size Relation):**  
   Using the conserved areal velocity and the area \(\pi a b\) of an ellipse, plus the geometric relations for ellipses and the link between \(p\), \(h\), and \(GM\), yields
   \[
   T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3.
   \]

Thus Newton’s law of universal gravitation not only explains Kepler’s empirical laws but specifies the constant in Kepler’s third law in terms of the gravitational constant and the central mass \(M\)."
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"We want \(\displaystyle \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\) at the Sun’s location in two situations:
1. Using the observed (real) rotation curve near the Sun.
2. For a Galaxy with all mass concentrated at the centre (Keplerian potential, no dark matter).

We are given the small‑distance (solar neighbourhood) formulae

\[
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \qquad
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
\]

where \(A\) and \(B\) are Oort’s constants.

---

## 1. General relation between \(dV/dR\) and Oort’s constants

Start from the definitions of the Oort constants in terms of the angular velocity \(\Omega(R)\):

\[
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}, 
\qquad
B = -\Omega_0 - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}.
\]

Add and subtract these:

- \(A - B = -\frac{1}{2}R_0\frac{d\Omega}{dR} + \Omega_0 + \frac{1}{2}R_0\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \Omega_0\).

Thus
\[
\Omega_0 = A - B.
\]

- Also we can write
\[
A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right),
\qquad
B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right),
\]
which are the standard forms in terms of the rotation curve \(V(R)\).

From these, solve for \(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\):

Add:

\[
A + B 
= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\right) 
  - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\right)
= -\,\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}.
\]

So, in full generality,

\[
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)}.
\]

This is the expression for the **actual observed rotation curve** (case I), because \(A\) and \(B\) are determined from observations.

---

## 2. Case I: Actual observed rotation curve

For the real Galaxy near the Sun:

\[
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}^{\text{(observed)}} = -(A + B).}
\]

Using representative measured values (for illustration only, not required by the problem),
e.g. \(A \approx 15\,\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{kpc}^{-1}\),
\(B \approx -12\,\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{kpc}^{-1}\),
you’d get

\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \approx -(15 - 12) \approx -3\;\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{kpc}^{-1},
\]

i.e. nearly flat rotation.

---

## 3. Case II: All mass at the centre (no dark matter, Keplerian rotation)

If all mass \(M\) is concentrated at the Galactic Centre, the circular speed is Keplerian:

\[
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}.
\]

So

\[
\frac{dV}{dR}
= -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}}
= -\frac{1}{2}\frac{V(R)}{R}.
\]

Evaluate at \(R = R_0\):

\[
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}^{\text{(Keplerian)}} 
= -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{V_0}{R_0}.}
\]

Equivalently, in terms of \(\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0\):

\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}^{\text{(Keplerian)}} = -\frac{1}{2}\Omega_0.
\]

This corresponds to an Oort constant combination \(A = \tfrac{3}{4}\Omega_0\), \(B = -\tfrac{1}{4}\Omega_0\), so that \(A - B = \Omega_0\) is still satisfied, but \(A + B = \tfrac{1}{2}\Omega_0\), giving

\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B) = -\frac{1}{2}\Omega_0 = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0},
\]

consistent with the Keplerian derivative above.

---

**Summary of the two requested expressions:**

- Observed Galaxy:
  \[
  \boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B).}
  \]

- Hypothetical point‑mass Galaxy (no dark matter):
  \[
  \boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{V_0}{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2}\Omega_0.}

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

### 1. Angular velocity and its radial derivative

The circular rotation speed is \(V(R)\), so the angular velocity is
\[
\Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}.
\]
At the Sun:
\[
\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}, \quad \text{with } V_0 = V(R_0).
\]

Differentiate \(\Omega(R)\) with respect to \(R\):
\[
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} 
= \frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)
= \frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}.
\]
Evaluate at \(R=R_0\):
\[
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
= \frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
- \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}.
\]

### 2. Definitions of Oort constants

From Oort’s local approximation (valid for \(D \ll R_0\)), one can show (and is standard in Galactic dynamics) that
\[
A = -\frac{1}{2}R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}, 
\qquad
B = A - \Omega_0.
\]

Now substitute the expression for \(\dfrac{d\Omega}{dR}\) and \(\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0\).

#### For \(A\):

\[
A = -\frac{1}{2}R_0\left(\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
- \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right)
= -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
- \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right).
\]

So
\[
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right)
}
\]

#### For \(B\):

\[
B = A - \Omega_0
= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right)
- \frac{V_0}{R_0}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
B
= -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right).
\]

So
\[
\boxed{
B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}\right)
}
\]

These are the required expressions for Oort’s constants in terms of the local rotation speed and its radial gradient."

---

### 1. Mechanical energy of a particle in a circular Keplerian orbit

For a test mass \(m\) in a circular orbit of radius \(R\) around a mass \(M\), the gravitational potential energy is
\[
U = -\frac{GMm}{R},
\]
and the kinetic energy is
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
\]

For a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:
\[
\frac{m v^2}{R} = \frac{GMm}{R^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{R}.
\]
Thus,
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{GMm}{2R}.
\]

The total mechanical energy is then
\[
E = K + U = \frac{GMm}{2R} - \frac{GMm}{R} = -\frac{GMm}{2R}.
\]

So the specific mechanical energy (energy per unit mass) in a circular orbit of radius \(R\) is
\[
\epsilon(R) \equiv \frac{E}{m} = -\frac{GM}{2R}.
\]

---

### 2. Change in mechanical energy as the gas moves inward

The gas element starts in a circular orbit at radius \(R_{\max}\), and moves slowly (via viscous dissipation) to a smaller circular orbit at radius \(r \ll R_{\max}\).  

The specific mechanical energy at \(R_{\max}\) is
\[
\epsilon(R_{\max}) = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}},
\]
and at radius \(r\) it is
\[
\epsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}.
\]

The change in specific mechanical energy of the gas element is
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}
= \epsilon(r) - \epsilon(R_{\max})
= \left(-\frac{GM}{2r}\right) - \left(-\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}\right)
= -\frac{GM}{2r} + \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}.
\]

This is the net *loss* in mechanical energy per unit mass (it is negative because the orbit is becoming more bound). The energy released (i.e. converted into internal energy and ultimately radiation) per unit mass is the magnitude of this change:
\[
\left|\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}\right|
= \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}.

### 3. Limit \(r \ll R_{\max}\)

The problem specifies \(R_{\min}/R_{\max} \ll 1\) and asks for the energy released from \(R_{\max}\) down to a radius \(r \ll R_{\max}\). In this limit,
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\max}} \ll \frac{1}{r},
\]
so the second term becomes negligible compared to the first, and we get approximately
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \simeq \frac{GM}{2r},
\]
where this is understood as the energy released per unit mass between \(R_{\max}\) and \(r\), expressed in terms of \(G\), \(M\), and \(r\).

So the exact expression is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}
= \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}}
\]
and in the limit \(r \ll R_{\max}\),
\[
\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \simeq \frac{GM}{2r}}.

23,"Magnetic fields in the Sun are constantly shaping the structure of various different features in the Solar atmosphere. Inside any feature, the magnetic field (B) adds to the total pressure exerted by the gas. This so-called magnetic pressure is a function of the height z and can be expressed as: ${P_{mag}}(z) = \frac{{B^2(z)}}{{2\mu_0}}$

On the other hand, the gas can be considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and hence the gas pressure decays exponentially from an initial pressure value $P_0$ with increasing z. It can be expressed as, ${P_{gas}}(z) = P_0e^{-z/H}$

25,"A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time.

Let ${t}_{1}$ be the time taken by the light beam from the Solar System to the mirror, let ${t}_{2}$ be the time taken by the beam from the mirror to the Solar System and $T$ the total time to go back and forth.

---

### 1. Setup

Let
- \(S(t)\) be the separation between Earth and the mirror at time \(t\),
- \(S(t) = s\,e^{H_0 t}\), with initial separation \(S(0)=s = D\),
- The laser is emitted at \(t=0\),
- It reaches the mirror at time \(t_1\),
- It returns to Earth at time \(t_2 = T\).

We assume the mirror is at rest in comoving coordinates, so its physical distance also evolves as \(D(t) = D e^{H_0 t}\). Light always moves at speed \(c\) relative to the local comoving frame.

---

### 2. Radial light propagation in an exponentially expanding universe

The comoving coordinate \(\chi\) of the mirror is constant. The physical distance is
\[
r(t) = a(t)\chi,\quad a(t) = e^{H_0 t},
\]
with \(a(0)=1\). Since initially \(r(0)=D\), we have \(\chi = D\).

For a radial light ray in this metric, 
\[
c\,dt = \pm a(t)\,d\chi \quad \Rightarrow \quad d\chi = \frac{c\,dt}{a(t)} = c\,e^{-H_0 t} dt.
\]

---

### 3. Forward trip (Earth → Mirror)

From emission at \(t=0\) (Earth, \(\chi=0\)) to reflection at \(t = t_1\) (mirror, \(\chi=D\)):
\[
\int_0^{D} d\chi = \int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t}\,dt.
\]
So
\[
D = c\int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t}\,dt 
= c\left[\frac{-1}{H_0}e^{-H_0 t}\right]_0^{t_1}
= \frac{c}{H_0}\left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}\right).
\]
(1) \(\quad D = \dfrac{c}{H_0}\left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}\right).\)

---

### 4. Return trip (Mirror → Earth)

From reflection at \(t = t_1\) (mirror, \(\chi=D\)) to detection at \(t=T\) (Earth, \(\chi=0\)):
\[
\int_0^{D} d\chi = \int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t}\,dt.
\]
So
\[
D = c\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-H_0 t}\,dt
= \frac{c}{H_0}\left(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}\right).
\]
(2) \(\quad D = \dfrac{c}{H_0}\left(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}\right).\)

---

### 5. Use symmetry of the setup

The light goes out and returns the same comoving distance \(D\), and the expansion is time-symmetric in this exponential model. Adding (1) and (2):

\[
2D = \frac{c}{H_0}\left[1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} + e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}\right]
= \frac{c}{H_0}\left(1 - e^{-H_0 T}\right).
\]

Thus
\[
2D = \frac{c}{H_0}\left(1 - e^{-H_0 T}\right)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2D H_0}{c}.
\]

Rearrange:
\[
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \frac{2D H_0}{c}.
\]

This is an implicit equation for \(H_0\). It cannot be solved in elementary closed form without special functions, but if \(H_0 T \ll 1\) (small expansion during the experiment) we can approximate.

---

### 6. Small-expansion approximation \(H_0 T \ll 1\)

Use the given approximation \(e^x \approx 1 + x\) for \(x \ll 1\). Then
\[
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T.
\]

So
\[
1 - H_0 T \approx 1 - \frac{2D H_0}{c}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
H_0 T \approx \frac{2D H_0}{c}.
\]

If \(H_0 \neq 0\), divide both sides by \(H_0\):
\[
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}.
\]

This tells us that to first order in \(H_0\) the round-trip time is essentially the same as in a non-expanding space, so the first-order correction cancels. To actually *determine* \(H_0\) from this experiment, one would need to go beyond the linear approximation.

---

### 7. Exact expression (implicit form)

From
\[
2D = \frac{c}{H_0}\left(1 - e^{-H_0 T}\right),
\]
we can write the exact functional relation:
\[
\boxed{\;H_0\ \text{is defined implicitly by}\quad
2D H_0 = c\left(1 - e^{-H_0 T}\right).\;}
\]

Equivalently,
\[
\boxed{\;e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \frac{2D H_0}{c}\;}
\]
which relates \(H_0\) to the measured \(D\), \(T\), and \(c\).

In practice, one would solve this equation for \(H_0\) numerically for given \(D\), \(T\), and \(c\)."

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"We want the gravitational-wave luminosity \(L_{GW}\) of a binary with two identical neutron stars of mass \(M\), orbiting in a circular orbit of radius \(R\) around their center of mass. We are told:

- \(L_{GW}\) is a single term involving only:
  - a dimensionless constant,
  - \(G\), \(c\),
  - and \(M\) and \(R\),
- and that \(c\) and \(R\) appear with the same power.
- The dimensionless constant from GR is given as \(\frac{2}{5}\).

We must determine the expression for \(L_{GW}\).

---

### 1. Dimensional analysis

We want:
\[
L_{GW} \sim G^a\, c^b\, M^c\, R^d,
\]
and we are told \(b = d\) (same power for \(c\) and \(R\)).

In terms of dimensions:

- \([G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}\)
- \([c] = L T^{-1}\)
- \([M] = M\)
- \([R] = L\)
- \([L_{GW}] = \text{power} = M L^2 T^{-3}\)

So,

\[
[G^a c^b M^c R^d] = 
M^{-a + c}\, L^{3a + b + d}\, T^{-2a - b}.
\]

We require:

\[
M: -a + c = 1
\]
\[
L: 3a + b + d = 2
\]
\[
T: -2a - b = -3
\]
and the condition \(b = d\).

Use the time exponent equation:
\[
-2a - b = -3 \quad\Rightarrow\quad b = -2a + 3.
\]

But \(d = b\), so \(d = -2a + 3\).

Now for the length exponent:
\[
3a + b + d = 2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 3a + b + b = 2
\]
\[
3a + 2b = 2.
\]
Substitute \(b = -2a + 3\):

\[
3a + 2(-2a + 3) = 2
\]
\[
3a - 4a + 6 = 2
\]
\[
-a + 6 = 2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad a = 4.
\]

Then
\[
b = -2a + 3 = -8 + 3 = -5,
\]
and
\[
d = b = -5.
\]

For the mass exponent:
\[
-a + c = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad -4 + c = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad c = 5.
\]

So
\[
L_{GW} \propto G^4 M^5 c^{-5} R^{-5}.
\]

Thus, up to a dimensionless factor,
\[
L_{GW} = K\,\frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5},
\]
for some constant \(K\).

---

### 2. Insert the given dimensionless constant

We are told the constant from GR is \(\frac{2}{5}\). Thus

\[
\boxed{
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5}\,\frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
}.
\]

This is the desired expression for the gravitational-wave luminosity of the equal-mass circular binary under the given assumptions."

This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"We want the rate at which the orbital radius \(R\) shrinks due to the loss of energy by gravitational waves.

**1. Orbital energy of the binary**

Two equal masses \(M\) orbiting their common center of mass at separation \(2R\) have a Newtonian orbital energy
\[
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}.
\]

(This follows from treating the system as two masses \(M\) separated by \(2R\), or from the reduced-mass formulation of the two-body problem.)

**2. Relate energy loss to radius change**

The system loses energy via gravitational radiation at the rate
\[
L_{GW} \equiv -\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}
= \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}.
\]

We also have \(E(R) = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}\), so
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}R}
= -\frac{G M^2}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}R}\left(R^{-1}\right)
= -\frac{G M^2}{4} \left(-R^{-2}\right)
= \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2}.
\]

By the chain rule,
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}
= \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}R} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}
= \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}.
\]

But \(\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}\), so
\[
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}
= - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}.
\]

**3. Solve for \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}\)**

Rearrange:
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}
= - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
= - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5} \cdot \frac{1}{R^3}.
\]

So the rate of change of the orbital radius is
\[
\boxed{
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}
= -\,\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
}
\]
(the negative sign indicates the orbit shrinks with time)."
