2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"Alright — let’s go step by step.  

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the setup**

We have a system of \( N \) particles (molecules, stars, etc.).  
For particle \( i \):

- Mass \( m_i \)
- Position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \) relative to a chosen origin
- Resultant force \( \mathbf{F}_i \) acting on it

The **virial** is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

We want to relate this to kinetic/potential energy via Newton’s second law.

---

## **Step 2: Newton’s second law**

Newton’s second law for particle \( i \):

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

So:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

---

## **Step 3: Relating \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}} \) to kinetic energy**

Consider the time derivative of \( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

That is:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = v_i^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

So:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - v_i^2
\]

---

## **Step 4: Virial expression**

Multiply by \( m_i \):

\[
m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = m_i \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - m_i v_i^2
\]

But \( m_i v_i^2 = 2 \times \frac12 m_i v_i^2 = 2 T_i \), where \( T_i \) is the kinetic energy of particle \( i \).

Also \( m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \).

Thus:

\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - 2 T_i
\]

---

## **Step 5: Sum over all particles**

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^N T_i
\]

Let \( T = \sum_{i=1}^N T_i \) = total kinetic energy.

Define:

\[
G = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

Then:

\[
\mathcal{V} = \frac{dG}{dt} - 2T
\]

---

## **Step 6: Time average**

For a bound system in steady state over a long time, the time average of \( \frac{dG}{dt} \) tends to zero if the system is periodic or confined (so \( G \) doesn’t grow without bound).  

Take time average over a long interval \( \tau \):

\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle_\tau = \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle_\tau - 2 \langle T \rangle_\tau
\]

But:

\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle_\tau = \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau} \to 0 \quad \text{as } \tau \to \infty
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
\]

---

## **Step 7: Relating \( \mathcal{V} \) to potential energy**

If the forces are **conservative** and derived from a potential \( U(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N) \) that is a homogeneous function of coordinates of degree \( k \), then by Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -k U
\]
where \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \).

For gravity (Newtonian potential), \( U \propto 1/r \), so \( k = -1 \) in \( U \propto r^{-1} \)?? Wait — careful:  

Actually, \( U \) for pairwise Newtonian gravity is:

\[
U = -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
\]

This is homogeneous of degree \( -1 \) in coordinates (scale coordinates by \( \lambda \), \( U \to \lambda^{-1} U \)).

Euler’s theorem: For a homogeneous function of degree \( n \), \( \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = n U \).

Here \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), so:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = - (n U)
\]

Since \( n = -1 \):

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -(-1) U = U
\]

Thus \( \mathcal{V} = U \) for gravity.

---

## **Step 8: Virial theorem for gravity**

From Step 6: \( \langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle \).  
From Step 7: \( \langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = \langle U \rangle \).

Therefore:

\[
\langle U \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
\]

Or:

\[
\langle T \rangle = -\frac12 \langle U \rangle
\]

Also total energy \( E = T + U \), so:

\[
E = \langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = -\langle T \rangle = \frac12 \langle U \rangle
\]

---

## **Final formula of the virial theorem (for Newtonian gravity)**

\[
\boxed{2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0}
\]

Or equivalently:

\[
\langle T \rangle = -\frac12 \langle U \rangle, \quad E = \frac12 \langle U \rangle = -\langle T \rangle
\]

## **1. Understanding the system**

We have \( N \) point masses \( m_i \) with position vectors \( \mathbf{r}_i(t) \) in an inertial frame.

The equation of motion for body \( i \) is:

\[
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j), \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N
\]

This is Newton’s second law with Newtonian gravity:  
The force on \( i \) due to \( j \) is:

\[
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

Note: \( \mathbf{F}_{ij} \) is the force **on \( i \) due to \( j \)**.  
From Newton’s third law: \( \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij} \).

---

## **2. First integral: Total linear momentum**

Let’s sum the equations of motion over all \( i \):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \mathbf{F}_{ij}
\]

But \( \mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \mathbf{F}_{ji} \), so in the double sum, each pair \( (i,j) \) with \( i \neq j \) appears twice with opposite signs.  
Indeed, for \( i < j \):

\[
\mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{F}_{ji} = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0
\]

So:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0
\]

Integrate once with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0
\]

Hence:

\[
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}
\]

This is **conservation of total linear momentum**.

---

## **3. First integral: Center of mass motion**

Define center of mass position:

\[
\mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i
\]

From \( \mathbf{P} = \text{constant} \), and \( \mathbf{P} = M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{cm}} \), we have:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} = \text{constant}
\]

Integrate:

\[
\mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}}(0) + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t
\]

So the CM moves with constant velocity — not an independent first integral beyond linear momentum, but a useful result.

---

## **4. First integral: Total angular momentum**

Take the cross product \( \mathbf{r}_i \times \) (equation of motion for \( i \)):

\[
m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

But \( \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j \).

Sum over \( i \):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

Now note: the double sum \( \sum_{i} \sum_{j \neq i} f_{ij} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) \) is antisymmetric in \( i, j \) because \( f_{ij} = f_{ji} \) (symmetric) but \( \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i \).

Let’s check carefully:  
Term for \( (i,j) \): \( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) \)  
Term for \( (j,i) \): \( \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i) = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) \)

So they cancel pairwise. Thus:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) = 0
\]

Therefore:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0
\]

But \( \frac{d}{dt} ( \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i ) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \).

So:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \frac{d}{dt} ( \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i ) = 0
\]

Integrate:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}
\]

This is **conservation of total angular momentum**.

---

## **5. First integral: Total energy**

Take dot product \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \) (equation of motion for \( i \)):

\[
m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

Sum over \( i \):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

Left-hand side: \( \sum_i \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac12 m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 \right) = \frac{dT}{dt} \), where \( T = \sum_i \frac12 m_i v_i^2 \) is total kinetic energy.

Right-hand side: Consider pair \( (i,j) \) with \( i<j \).  
From the double sum, terms for \( (i,j) \) and \( (j,i) \):

Term \( (i,j) \): \( -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \)  
Term \( (j,i) \): \( -\frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \)

But \( \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \), so term \( (j,i) \) becomes \( +\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \).

Add the two terms:

\[
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right]
\]
\[
= -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
\]

Now \( \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j \), \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \), and \( r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_{ij}| \).

Note: \( \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \frac{d r_{ij}}{dt} \), and \( \frac{d r_{ij}}{dt} = \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \).

Thus:

\[
(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij} = r_{ij} \dot{r}_{ij}
\]

So the sum of the two terms for pair \( (i,j) \) is:

\[
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (r_{ij} \dot{r}_{ij}) = -G m_i m_j \frac{\dot{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}^2}
\]

But \( -G m_i m_j \frac{\dot{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right) \).

Thus the right-hand side of the energy equation becomes:

\[
\sum_{i<j} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right)
\]

Define gravitational potential energy:

\[
U = -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}}
\]

Then \( \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} = -U \), so:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{dU}{dt}
\]

So the original equation \( \frac{dT}{dt} = -\frac{dU}{dt} \) becomes:

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} (T + U) = 0
\]

So:

\[
E = T + U = \text{constant}
\]

This is **conservation of total mechanical energy**.

## **6. Summary of first integrals**

From the \( N \)-body gravitational equations:

1. **Total linear momentum** \( \mathbf{P} = \sum m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) — 3 constants.
2. **Total angular momentum** \( \mathbf{L} = \sum m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \) — 3 constants.
3. **Total energy** \( E = T + U \) — 1 constant.

Also, from (1), the center of mass moves uniformly: \( \mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}}(0) + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t \) — not an extra integral but a consequence.

These are the **classical first integrals** for the \( N \)-body problem in Newtonian gravity.

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"Alright — let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have a celestial body (e.g., a planet or comet) moving in an **elliptical orbit** around a star (or primary body) under Newtonian gravity.

Given:

- \( \mu = G(M+m) \), often approximated as \( GM \) if \( m \ll M \).
- \( a \) = semi-major axis of ellipse.
- \( e \) = eccentricity.
- **Aphelion** \( r_A \) = farthest distance from the star.
- **Perihelion** \( r_P \) = closest distance from the star.

We are to prove:

\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}
\]
\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
\]

---

## **2. Known relations for an ellipse**

For an ellipse with the star at one focus:

\[
r_A = a(1+e), \quad r_P = a(1-e)
\]

**Vis-viva equation** (energy equation for Keplerian motion):

\[
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

---

## **3. Apply vis-viva at aphelion**

At aphelion: \( r = r_A = a(1+e) \).

\[
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1+e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

Factor \( \frac{1}{a} \):

\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1+e} - 1 \right)
\]

\[
\frac{2}{1+e} - 1 = \frac{2 - (1+e)}{1+e} = \frac{1-e}{1+e}
\]

Thus:

\[
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1-e}{1+e}
\]
\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}
\]

---

## **4. Apply vis-viva at perihelion**

At perihelion: \( r = r_P = a(1-e) \).

\[
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1-e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1-e} - 1 \right)
\]

\[
\frac{2}{1-e} - 1 = \frac{2 - (1-e)}{1-e} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}
\]

Thus:

\[
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e}
\]
\[
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
\]

---

## **5. Alternative check via angular momentum conservation**

Angular momentum per unit mass \( h = r v_\perp \), and at perihelion/aphelion velocity is purely transverse.

So:

\[
h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A
\]

From earlier: \( r_P = a(1-e) \), \( r_A = a(1+e) \).

Thus:

\[
a(1-e) v_P = a(1+e) v_A
\]
\[
\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}
\]

From vis-viva, we already have \( v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1-e}{1+e} \), so indeed:

\[
v_P = v_A \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}} \cdot \frac{1+e}{1-e}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
\]

Consistent.

---

## **6. Final answer**

We have proved:

\[
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}}
\]

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- A **very long cylindrical planet** — this means we treat it as an infinite cylinder of radius \( R \) and uniform density \( \rho \).
- A **satellite** orbiting around the cylinder’s axis, at a distance \( d \) from the center.
- We want the **orbital period** \( P \) in terms of \( d \), \( \rho \), \( R \), and constants.

---

## **2. Gravitational field of an infinite cylinder**

For an **infinite uniform cylinder** (density \( \rho \), radius \( R \)), the gravitational field outside (\( d > R \)) can be found using Gauss’s law for gravity.

Gauss’s law for gravity:

\[
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]

Here \( g \) is gravitational acceleration magnitude (radially inward toward axis), \( M_{\text{enc}} \) is mass enclosed inside radius \( d \) if \( d \le R \), but for \( d > R \), \( M_{\text{enc}} \) is the total mass per unit length times length \( L \) of Gaussian surface.

---

**Mass per unit length** of the cylinder:

\[
\lambda = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2)
\]

---

**Gaussian surface**: Choose a cylindrical surface of radius \( d \) and length \( L \), coaxial with the planet.

For \( d > R \), enclosed mass per length \( L \) is \( \lambda L \).

Flux of \( \vec{g} \) through this Gaussian surface:

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\lambda L)
\]

Minus sign because \( \vec{g} \) is inward; we take magnitude:

\[
g \cdot 2\pi d L = 4\pi G \lambda L
\]

Cancel \( 2\pi L \):

\[
g = \frac{2 G \lambda}{d}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda = \rho \pi R^2 \):

\[
g(d) = \frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d}, \quad d > R
\]

---

**Inside the cylinder** (\( d < R \)): enclosed mass per length \( L \) is \( \rho \cdot (\pi d^2) L \), so \( M_{\text{enc}}/L = \rho \pi d^2 \).

Gauss’s law:

\[
g \cdot 2\pi d L = 4\pi G (\rho \pi d^2 L)
\]

\[
g = 2\pi G \rho \, d
\]

---

But the satellite is **orbiting** around the axis, so \( g \) is the centripetal acceleration.

---

## **3. Orbital motion**

For a circular orbit at distance \( d \) from axis:

\[
g(d) = \frac{v^2}{d}
\]

where \( v = \frac{2\pi d}{P} \), \( P \) = orbital period.

So:

\[
g(d) = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}
\]

---

## **4. Two cases**

**(a) Satellite outside the cylinder** (\( d > R \)):

\[
\frac{2 G \rho \pi R^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}
\]

Multiply through:

\[
2 G \rho \pi R^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2}
\]

\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2 G \rho \pi R^2}
\]

\[
P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
\]

\[
P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}
\]

---

**(b) Satellite inside the cylinder** (\( d < R \)):

\[
2\pi G \rho \, d = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}
\]

Cancel \( d \) (nonzero):

\[
2\pi G \rho = \frac{4\pi^2}{P^2}
\]

\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{2\pi G\rho} = \frac{2\pi}{G\rho}
\]

So \( P \) is **constant**, independent of \( d \) for \( d < R \).

---

## **5. Final expression**

We have:

\[
P = 
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}, & 0 < d \le R \\
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}, & d \ge R
\end{cases}
\]

---

**Final answer**:

\[
\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}} \times \max\left(1, \frac{d}{R}\right)}
\]

Or equivalently:

For \( d \le R \), \( P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}} \).  
For \( d \ge R \), \( P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R} \).",0.637

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have two galaxies, both of radius \( R \).

**Galaxy A** (spiral):  
At distance \( r = R \) from its center, the **rotational velocity** is \( v \).  
This implies we can use the circular motion equation to find mass.

**Galaxy B** (spherical elliptical, uniform density):  
At \( r = R \), the **radial velocity dispersion** is \( v \).  
For a uniform sphere of stars, the velocity dispersion relates to mass via the virial theorem.

We are to **calculate the masses** of both galaxies.

---

## **2. Galaxy A (spiral)**

For a spiral galaxy, if we assume the rotation curve is flat at \( r = R \) (typical for many spirals beyond a certain radius), then the rotational velocity \( v \) is related to mass **enclosed within radius \( R \)** by Newtonian gravity for a spherical mass distribution (or approximation for disk at large r):

\[
\frac{GM_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]
for a test mass at \( r = R \) orbiting in circular motion.

Thus:
\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

This is the **mass inside radius \( R \)**.

---

## **3. Galaxy B (uniform density sphere)**

Given: spherical, uniform density, evenly spaced stars.  
Let total mass = \( M_B \), radius = \( R \), uniform density \( \rho = \frac{3 M_B}{4\pi R^3} \).

For a **uniform sphere**, the velocity dispersion \( \sigma \) is related to mass by the **virial theorem**.  
For a self-gravitating system of \( N \) stars, the **rms speed** \( \sigma \) satisfies:

\[
2 \langle K \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\]
where \( \langle K \rangle = \frac12 M_{\text{total}} \sigma^2 \) (for isotropic velocities, 3D dispersion \( \sigma_{\text{3D}}^2 = 3 \sigma_r^2 \) if \( \sigma_r \) is the **radial** velocity dispersion given).

---

**Important:** The problem says: “Galaxy B’s radial velocity dispersion is also equal to \( v \)”.  
That means \( \sigma_r = v \) (1D radial component of velocity dispersion).

For isotropic velocities in a uniform sphere,  
\[
\sigma_{\text{3D}}^2 = 3 \sigma_r^2 = 3 v^2.
\]

---

### **Potential energy of uniform sphere**:
\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}.
\]

### **Kinetic energy**:
\[
K = \frac12 M_B \sigma_{\text{3D}}^2 = \frac12 M_B (3 v^2).
\]

Virial theorem \( 2K = -U \):

\[
2 \times \frac12 M_B (3 v^2) = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}.
\]

\[
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}.
\]

Cancel \( 3 M_B \) (assuming \( M_B \neq 0 \)):

\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}

\[
M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have a white dwarf supported by **electron degeneracy pressure**:

\[
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
\]
where \( n \) = number density of electrons.

Gravitational pressure (inward) is given by:

\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
\]
So
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3GM^2}{5R} = \frac{GM^2}{5R V}.
\]

The star is spherical: \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \).

Thus:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GM^2}{5R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^5}.
\]

---

## **2. Relating \( n \) to mass density \( \rho \)**

The star contains nuclei with atomic number \( Z \) and mass number \( A \).  
Let \( m_p \) = proton mass, \( m_n \approx m_p \) = nucleon mass.

Mass of each nucleus ≈ \( A m_p \) (approximately, ignoring binding energy).

Each nucleus contributes \( Z \) electrons.

Let \( n_{\text{nuclei}} \) = number density of nuclei.  
Then \( n = Z \, n_{\text{nuclei}} \).

Mass density:
\[
\rho = (\text{mass per nucleus}) \times n_{\text{nuclei}} = A m_p \, n_{\text{nuclei}}.
\]

Thus:
\[
n_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{\rho}{A m_p}, \quad n = Z \cdot \frac{\rho}{A m_p}.
\]

So:
\[
n = \frac{Z}{A m_p} \, \rho.
\]

---

## **3. Pressure balance**

At equilibrium:
\[
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}.
\]

Substitute \( n \) into \( p_{\text{electron}} \):

\[
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3}.
\]

Gravitational pressure:
\[
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^5}.
\]

Also, total mass \( M = \rho \cdot V = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \), so:
\[
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}, \quad R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

---

## **4. Eliminate \( R \) in \( p_g \)**

From \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \), we have \( R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \), so \( R^5 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{5/3} \).

Thus:
\[
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{R^5} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{5/3}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} \frac{\rho^{5/3}}{M^{5/3}}.
\]

\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} M^{2 - 5/3} \rho^{5/3}.
\]

\[
M^{2 - 5/3} = M^{1/3}.
\]

So:
\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} M^{1/3} \rho^{5/3}.
\]

---

## **5. Equating \( p_e = p_g \)**

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} M^{1/3} \rho^{5/3}.
\]

Cancel \( \rho^{5/3} \) from both sides (non-zero density):

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} M^{1/3}.
\]

---

## **6. Solve for \( \rho \)**

Wait — we canceled \( \rho^{5/3} \), so \( \rho \) seems to disappear? That means equilibrium gives a relation between \( M \) and \( \rho \) that is actually independent of \( \rho \) unless we made a slip.

Let’s check: \( p_e \propto \rho^{5/3} \), \( p_g \propto M^{1/3} \rho^{5/3} \). Yes, both have \( \rho^{5/3} \), so after canceling, we get:

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{5/3} M^{1/3}.
\]

So \( M^{1/3} \) is determined by constants, meaning \( M \) is fixed? That’s the **Chandrasekhar mass** scaling — but here they ask for **density** in terms of \( M \), \( A \), \( Z \).

But if \( M \) is fixed by constants, then \( \rho \) is not determined unless we bring in another relation.  

Hold on — I realize: In this derivation, \( \rho \) is **uniform** in the simple model, and \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \), so \( R \) is not fixed separately. But we eliminated \( R \) using \( \rho \) and \( M \). The equation after canceling \( \rho^{5/3} \) gives \( M \) = constant, which is the maximum mass for a given \( Z/A \).  

But maybe they mean: For a **given** \( M \) below that limit, the equilibrium \( \rho \) is not uniquely determined unless we consider **non-uniform** density? Actually, in this crude uniform-density model, \( \rho \) cancels out, so any \( \rho \) satisfies equilibrium if \( M \) has that special value. That’s suspicious.

Let’s re-check \( p_g \) formula:  
We used \( p_g = GM^2/(5 R V) \) earlier, but \( V = 4\pi R^3/3 \), so \( p_g = 3GM^2/(20\pi R^4) \) — oops! Mistake: \( R V = R \cdot (4\pi R^3/3) = 4\pi R^4/3 \), so \( p_g = GM^2 / (5 \cdot 4\pi R^4/3) = 3GM^2/(20\pi R^4) \), not \( R^5 \).  

Yes! That’s the error. Let’s correct.

---

**Correction:**

\[
p_g = \frac{GM^2}{5 R \cdot V} = \frac{GM^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}.
\]

Now \( R^4 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{4/3} \).

So:
\[
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3}.
\]

\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2 - 4/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

\[
M^{2 - 4/3} = M^{2/3}.
\]

Thus:
\[
p_g = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

---

## **7. Now equate \( p_e \) and \( p_g \)**

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

Cancel \( \rho^{4/3} \):

\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **8. Solve for \( \rho \)**

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} }.
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator to simplify constants:

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \cdot M^{2/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{3G}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2} = \frac{3G \cdot 5 m_e}{20\pi \hbar^2} = \frac{15G m_e}{20\pi \hbar^2} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \).

So:
\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \cdot M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **9. Combine the dimensionless constants**

Let \( C = \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \).

First, \( (3\pi^2)^{2/3} = 3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3} \).

\( \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} = \frac{(4\pi)^{4/3}}{3^{4/3}} = \frac{4^{4/3} \pi^{4/3}}{3^{4/3}} \).

So:
\[
C = \frac{4^{4/3} \pi^{4/3}}{3^{4/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3}} = \frac{4^{4/3}}{3^{4/3} \cdot 3^{2/3}} = \frac{4^{4/3}}{3^{2}}.
\]

Since \( 4^{4/3} = (2^2)^{4/3} = 2^{8/3} \), we can leave as \( \frac{2^{8/3}}{9} \).

Thus:
\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{2^{8/3}}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \cdot M^{2/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{G m_e}{12\pi \hbar^2} \cdot 2^{8/3} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \cdot M^{2/3}.
\]

---

## **10. Final expression for \( \rho \)**

Cube both sides:

\[
\rho = \left[ \frac{G m_e}{12\pi \hbar^2} \cdot 2^{8/3} \right]^3 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2.
\]

\[
= \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{ (12\pi)^3 \hbar^6 } \cdot 2^{8} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2.
\]

Since \( (12\pi)^3 = 1728 \pi^3 \), and \( 2^8 = 256 \):

\[
\rho = \frac{256}{1728 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2.
\]

\[
\frac{256}{1728} = \frac{128}{864} = \frac{64}{432} = \frac{32}{216} = \frac{16}{108} = \frac{8}{54} = \frac{4}{27}.
\]

So:
\[
\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2.
\]

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{\rho = \frac{4G^3 m_e^3}{27\pi^3 \hbar^6} \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2}
\]

13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to:

---

## **Step 1: Write down the given formulas**

Magnetic field at position \(\vec{r}\) due to dipole \(\vec{m}_1\):

\[
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
\]

Potential energy of dipole \(\vec{m}_2\) in an external field \(\vec{B}\):

\[
U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}
\]

Here, \(\vec{B}\) is the field produced by \(\vec{m}_1\) at the location of \(\vec{m}_2\).

So:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1
\]

---

## **Step 2: Substitute \(\vec{B}_1\) into \(U_{\text{int}}\)**

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
\]

Factor constants out:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right) \right]
\]

---

## **Step 3: Expand the dot product**

\[
\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
= 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1
\]

Thus:

\[
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]
\]

---

## **Step 4: Final expression**

\[
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]
\]

This is the **classical dipole-dipole interaction energy** for two magnetic dipoles separated by \(\vec{r} = r \hat{r}\).

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the problem**

We have:

- Electron mass \( m_e \)
- Proton mass \( m_p \)
- Radius of orbit \( r \)
- Coulomb attraction: \( F = \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \) (where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \) in SI, but often in atomic physics \( k \) is absorbed into units; here they just say ""Coulombic attraction"" so we can write \( F = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2} \) or simply \( \frac{e^2}{r^2} \) in Gaussian units. I’ll keep \( k \) explicit for clarity.)
- \( m_p \gg m_e \) means proton is essentially fixed at the center (reduced mass \( \mu \approx m_e \)).

We are to find:

1. **Total energy** \( E \) of the electron.
2. **Orbital angular momentum** \( L \) of the electron.

---

## **2. Force balance for circular orbit**

For a circular orbit of radius \( r \), centripetal force is provided by Coulomb force:

\[
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{r^2}
\]
where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \).

From this:

\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r}.
\]

---

## **3. Kinetic energy**

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{2r}.
\]

---

## **4. Potential energy**

Coulomb potential energy (with zero at infinity):

\[
U = -\frac{k e^2}{r}.
\]

---

## **5. Total energy**

\[
E = K + U = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}.
\]

So:

\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}}
\]
with \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \) in SI.

---

## **6. Orbital angular momentum**

\[
L = m_e v r.
\]

From \( m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r} \), we have \( v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \).

Thus:

\[
L = m_e \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \cdot r
= \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}.
\]

So:

\[
\boxed{L = e \sqrt{k m_e r}}
\]
in SI units (with \( k = 1/(4\pi\varepsilon_0) \)).

## **7. Final expressions**

\[
E = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\varepsilon_0 r}, \quad L = e \sqrt{\frac{m_e r}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}}

\[
E = -\frac{e^2}{2r}, \quad L = e \sqrt{m_e r}.

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Earth mass \( M \), gravitational constant \( G \).
- Space station mass \( m_2 \) in **circular orbit** of radius \( R \).
- Meteorite mass \( m_1 \) **radially approaching Earth** (velocity purely radial, no tangential component initially relative to Earth’s center).
- Collision happens at radius \( R \) (same as space station’s orbit).
- After collision: meteorite + space station stick together → conglomerate mass \( m_1 + m_2 \).
- Conglomerate moves in a **closed orbit** with **perigee** \( r_p = R/2 \) (closest approach to Earth’s center).
- We must find:
  1. Shape of conglomerate’s orbit.
  2. (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision.
  3. (ii) Min and max speeds of conglomerate.
  4. (iii) Max distance from Earth’s center.
  5. Condition on \( m_1, m_2 \) for this scenario.

---

## **Step 2: Known orbit parameters before collision**

**Space station before collision:**

Circular orbit at radius \( R \):

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]
Tangential velocity, direction perpendicular to radius vector.

**Meteorite before collision:**

Radial velocity \( u \) (unknown magnitude, sign toward Earth), so at radius \( R \):

Velocity vector: \( \vec{v}_1 = -u \, \hat{r} \) (radially inward).

No tangential component.

---

## **Step 3: Conservation of angular momentum at collision**

Collision is instantaneous at \( r = R \).

Angular momentum per unit mass for a particle relative to Earth’s center:

\[
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{v}.
\]

For space station: \( \vec{r} \perp \vec{v}_2 \) → magnitude \( L_2 = R v_2 = R \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \sqrt{GMR} \).

For meteorite: radial velocity → \( \vec{r} \times \vec{v}_1 = 0 \) → \( L_1 = 0 \).

Total angular momentum before collision:

\[
L_{\text{before}} = m_2 \sqrt{GMR} + m_1 \cdot 0 = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}.
\]

After collision, conglomerate mass \( m_1 + m_2 \) has velocity \( \vec{V} \) with tangential component \( V_\theta \) and radial component \( V_r \).

Angular momentum after collision (immediately after impact, still at \( r = R \)):

\[
L_{\text{after}} = (m_1 + m_2) R V_\theta.
\]

Conservation of angular momentum:

\[
(m_1 + m_2) R V_\theta = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}.
\]
\[
V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
\]

---

## **Step 4: Conservation of linear momentum (radial direction)**

Before collision:

Radial momentum = \( m_1 (-u) + m_2 \cdot 0 \) (space station’s velocity is purely tangential at collision instant, so radial component 0).

After collision:

Radial momentum = \( (m_1 + m_2) V_r \).

So:

\[
- m_1 u = (m_1 + m_2) V_r.
\]
\[
V_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} u.
\]

---

## **Step 5: Energy considerations**

Before collision:

Kinetic energy:

\[
K_{\text{before}} = \frac12 m_1 u^2 + \frac12 m_2 \left( \frac{GM}{R} \right).
\]

Potential energy (both at \( r = R \)):

\[
U_{\text{before}} = -\frac{GMm_1}{R} - \frac{GMm_2}{R}.
\]

Total mechanical energy before:

\[
E_{\text{before}} = \frac12 m_1 u^2 + \frac12 m_2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

After collision (immediately after, still at \( r = R \)):

Velocity magnitude \( V = \sqrt{V_r^2 + V_\theta^2} \).

\[
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 u^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}.
\]

Kinetic energy after:

\[
K_{\text{after}} = \frac12 (m_1 + m_2) V^2.
\]

Potential energy after (same \( r \)):

\[
U_{\text{after}} = -\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

Total mechanical energy after:

\[
E_{\text{after}} = \frac12 (m_1 + m_2) V^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

Energy is conserved through the collision? **No** — inelastic collision (they stick), so mechanical energy not conserved through collision. But gravitational potential energy is same before/after collision (same position), so loss in KE equals loss in total mechanical energy.

Actually, easier: **Total mechanical energy after collision** is what determines the new orbit.

So compute \( E_{\text{after}} \) from \( V^2 \) above.

---

## **Step 6: Orbit geometry after collision**

We know perigee \( r_p = R/2 \).

At perigee: only tangential velocity \( v_p \) (radial velocity zero).

Angular momentum \( L = (m_1 + m_2) r_p v_p = (m_1 + m_2) \frac{R}{2} v_p \).

But \( L \) is known from Step 3: \( L = m_2 \sqrt{GMR} \).

So:

\[
(m_1 + m_2) \frac{R}{2} v_p = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}.
\]
\[
v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
\]

---

## **Step 7: Energy of conglomerate orbit**

Total energy after collision (constant for orbit):

\[
E = \frac12 (m_1 + m_2) v_p^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{r_p}.
\]

Substitute \( v_p \) and \( r_p = R/2 \):

\[
E = \frac12 (m_1 + m_2) \left[ \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right]^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2}.
\]

First term:

\[
\frac12 (m_1 + m_2) \cdot \frac{4 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \cdot \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{2 m_2^2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \frac{GM}{R}.
\]

Second term:

\[
- \frac{2 GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

So:

\[
E = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ \frac{2 m_2^2}{m_1 + m_2} - 2(m_1 + m_2) \right].
\]

Factor \( \frac{GM}{R} \):

\[
E = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{2 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1 + m_2}.
\]

\[
E = -\frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{2\left[ (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 \right]}{m_1 + m_2}.
\]

\[
E = -\frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)}{m_1 + m_2}.
\]

\[
E = -\frac{2GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R(m_1 + m_2)}.
\]

---

## **Step 8: Relating \( E \) to \( u \) (meteorite speed before collision)**

We can also compute \( E \) from just after collision conditions at \( r = R \):

\[
E = \frac12 (m_1 + m_2) V^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R},
\]
with \( V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 \), \( V_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} u \), \( V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \).

So:

\[
V^2 = \frac{m_1^2 u^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
E = \frac12 \cdot \frac{m_1^2 u^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}}{m_1 + m_2} - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}.
\]

Set equal to the \( E \) from Step 7:

\[
\frac{m_1^2 u^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}}{2(m_1 + m_2)} - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R} = -\frac{2GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R(m_1 + m_2)}.
\]

Multiply through by \( 2(m_1 + m_2) \):

\[
m_1^2 u^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)^2}{R} = -\frac{4GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R}.
\]

Bring terms with \( GM/R \) together:

\[
m_1^2 u^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 - 4 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) \right].
\]

Simplify bracket:

First: \( 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + 2 m_2^2 \).

Subtract \( m_2^2 \): \( 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 \).

Subtract \( 4 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) = 4 m_1^2 + 8 m_1 m_2 \):

\[
(2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) - (4 m_1^2 + 8 m_1 m_2) = -2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2.
\]

So:

\[
m_1^2 u^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left( m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 \right).
\]

Thus:

\[
u^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2} - 2 - \frac{4 m_2}{m_1} \right).
\]

---

## **Step 9: Condition for scenario to be possible**

We need \( u^2 > 0 \) (real speed before collision).

\[
\frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2} - \frac{4 m_2}{m_1} - 2 > 0.
\]

Let \( x = m_2 / m_1 > 0 \).

Condition: \( x^2 - 4x - 2 > 0 \).

Roots: \( x = 2 \pm \sqrt{6} \).

Inequality holds for \( x > 2 + \sqrt{6} \) (since \( 2 - \sqrt{6} < 0 \), but \( x > 0 \), so the relevant branch is \( x > 2 + \sqrt{6} \)).

So:

\[
\frac{m_2}{m_1} > 2 + \sqrt{6}.
\]

Also, orbit is closed → total energy \( E < 0 \) (we already have \( E < 0 \) from formula, check if always true given condition).

From \( E = -\frac{2GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R(m_1 + m_2)} \), clearly \( E < 0 \) for positive masses.

---

## **Step 10: Shape of orbit**

Given \( r_p = R/2 \) and \( E < 0 \), orbit is **ellipse**.

We can find apogee \( r_a \) from energy & angular momentum.

For elliptical orbit:

\[
E = -\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{2a} \quad \text{(per unit mass? Wait, E here is total energy for the conglomerate)}.
\]

Actually careful: In the two-body problem with Earth fixed (Earth mass \( M \gg m_1 + m_2 \)), the reduced mass correction is negligible, so the orbit equation is for a test mass \( m = m_1 + m_2 \) in potential \( -GMm/r \).

Then:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = -\frac{GMm}{2a}, \quad m = m_1 + m_2.
\]

From Step 7: \( E_{\text{total}} = -\frac{2GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R(m_1 + m_2)} \).

So:

\[
-\frac{GMm}{2a} = -\frac{2GM m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R m}.
\]

Cancel \( GM \), \( m = m_1 + m_2 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2a} = \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R m^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
a = \frac{R m^2}{4 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}.
\]

Also, angular momentum \( L = m \sqrt{GMR_p} e? \) Let’s use \( r_p = a(1-e) \), \( r_a = a(1+e) \).

We know \( r_p = R/2 \), so:

\[
\frac{R}{2} = a(1-e).
\]

Also \( L^2 = GM m^2 a (1-e^2) \).

But \( L = m_2 \sqrt{GMR} \) from Step 3.

So:

\[
(m_2 \sqrt{GMR})^2 = GM m^2 a (1-e^2).
\]

\[
m_2^2 R = m^2 a (1-e^2).
\]

From \( a(1-e) = R/2 \), we have \( 1+e = \frac{2a - R/2}{a}? \) Let’s solve systematically.

From \( r_p = a(1-e) = R/2 \), \( 1-e = \frac{R}{2a} \).

Also \( 1-e^2 = \frac{m_2^2 R}{m^2 a} \) from above.

But \( 1-e^2 = (1-e)(1+e) = \frac{R}{2a} (1+e) \).

So:

\[
\frac{R}{2a} (1+e) = \frac{m_2^2 R}{m^2 a}.
\]

Cancel \( R/a \):

\[
\frac{1+e}{2} = \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
1+e = \frac{2 m_2^2}{m^2}.
\]

Then \( e = \frac{2 m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \).

---

## **Step 11: Apogee distance**

\( r_a = a(1+e) \).

We have \( 1+e = \frac{2 m_2^2}{m^2} \), and \( a = \frac{R m^2}{4 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} \).

So:

\[
r_a = \frac{R m^2}{4 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} \cdot \frac{2 m_2^2}{m^2}.
\]

\[
r_a = \frac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}.
\]

---

## **Step 12: Speeds of conglomerate**

We already have \( v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \).

At apogee: \( v_a r_a = v_p r_p \) (angular momentum conservation).

So \( v_a = v_p \cdot \frac{r_p}{r_a} \).

\( r_p / r_a = \frac{R/2}{ \frac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} } = \frac{1}{ \frac{m_2^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} } = \frac{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m_2^2} \).

Thus:

\[
v_a = \frac{2 m_2}{m} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \cdot \frac{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m_2^2}.
\]

\[
v_a = \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m_2 m",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"Alright — let’s go step by step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the problem**

We are told:

- Galaxies have a large angular size, so their total light is spread over a large solid angle.
- **Apparent magnitude** \( m \) is for the *total* light from the object.
- **Surface magnitude** is magnitude per unit solid angle (e.g., \( \text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2 \)).
- We need to show that in a **non-expanding universe**, surface magnitude is **independent of distance**.

---

## **Step 2: Recall definitions**

Let:

- \( F \) = total flux received from the galaxy (energy per unit time per unit area at Earth).
- \( L \) = total luminosity of the galaxy (energy per unit time emitted).
- \( d \) = distance to the galaxy.

In a static Euclidean universe (non-expanding, no cosmological effects),  
\[
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}.
\]

---

**Apparent magnitude** \( m \) is related to flux \( F \) by:
\[
m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
\]
where \( F_0 \) is a reference flux for \( m=0 \).

---

**Solid angle** \( \Omega \) subtended by the galaxy:

If the galaxy has physical area \( A \) (face-on area perpendicular to line of sight), then  
\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2} \quad \text{(in steradians)}.
\]

---

## **Step 3: Surface brightness definition**

**Surface brightness** \( S \) in astronomy is flux per unit solid angle:
\[
S = \frac{F}{\Omega}.
\]

Units: \( \text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{sr}^{-1} \) (physically), but astronomers often use magnitudes per square arcsecond or arcminute.

---

**Surface magnitude** \( \mu \) is defined so that:

If \( S_0 \) is the surface brightness corresponding to magnitude 0 per unit solid angle, then
\[
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{S}{S_0} \right).
\]

---

## **Step 4: Express \( S \) in terms of intrinsic properties**

From \( F = L/(4\pi d^2) \) and \( \Omega = A/d^2 \):

\[
S = \frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{L/(4\pi d^2)}{A/d^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi A}.
\]

Notice: **Distance \( d \) cancels out completely!**

---

## **Step 5: Interpretation**

The quantity \( L/A \) is the **luminosity per unit physical area** of the galaxy’s face (sometimes called **intrinsic surface brightness** \( I \)):

\[
S = \frac{I}{4\pi}, \quad I = \frac{L}{A}.
\]

Thus \( S \) depends only on intrinsic properties of the galaxy, not on distance \( d \).

Therefore **surface magnitude** \( \mu \) is independent of distance.

---

## **Step 6: Intuitive explanation**

In a static Euclidean universe:

- Flux \( F \) falls off as \( 1/d^2 \).
- Solid angle \( \Omega \) also falls off as \( 1/d^2 \) (for fixed physical size).
- Their ratio \( F/\Omega \) is constant with distance.

So the galaxy appears larger in angle when closer, but also each patch of it is brighter in flux per unit angular area by exactly the same factor? Wait — careful: Actually, \( S = F/\Omega \) is constant, so the **angular brightness** (flux per square arcsecond) is the same at any distance. That means if you blur the image to the same angular resolution, each angular patch receives the same flux regardless of distance.

Thus surface magnitude (per arcmin²) is distance-independent.

---

## **Step 7: Conclusion**

We have shown mathematically:

\[
S = \frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{L/(4\pi d^2)}{A/d^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi A}
\]
which is independent of \( d \). Hence surface magnitude \( \mu \) is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe.

---

\[
\boxed{\text{Surface magnitude is independent of distance because both flux and solid angle scale as } 1/d^2, \text{ so their ratio is constant.}}

17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Conclude:

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}

= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"Alright — let’s go step by step.  

---

## **Step 1: Setting up the problem**

Newton’s law of universal gravitation says the force between the Sun (mass \( M \)) and a planet (mass \( m \)) is:

\[
\mathbf{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the vector from the Sun to the planet, \( r = |\mathbf{r}| \), and \( \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r}/r \).

We assume \( M \gg m \), so the Sun is essentially fixed at the origin (or more precisely, the reduced mass correction can be ignored for this derivation; the center of mass is nearly at the Sun).

Equation of motion:

\[
m \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Cancel \( m \):

\[
\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]
\[
\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \mathbf{r}
\]

---

## **Step 2: Angular momentum conservation**

Take the cross product of \( \mathbf{r} \) with the equation of motion:

\[
\mathbf{r} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} ( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{r} ) = \mathbf{0}
\]

But \( \frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}) = \dot{\mathbf{r}} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{r} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}} \).

So:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}) = \mathbf{0}
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}} \quad \text{is constant (vector)}
\]

This \( \mathbf{h} \) is the **specific angular momentum** (angular momentum per unit mass). Its magnitude \( h = |\mathbf{h}| \) is constant, and its direction is fixed, so the motion is in a plane.

---

## **Step 3: Kepler’s second law (equal areas in equal times)**

In polar coordinates in the orbital plane:

\[
\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]
\[
\dot{\mathbf{r}} = \dot{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\]

Angular momentum per unit mass:

\[
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times (\dot{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = r^2 \dot{\theta} \, (\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})
\]

Let \( \hat{\mathbf{k}} = \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \) (unit vector perpendicular to the plane), so:

\[
h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

Area swept out per unit time:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

That’s **Kepler’s second law**.

---

## **Step 4: Shape of the orbit — Kepler’s first law**

We have:

\[
\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Use the **Binet equation**: express \( r \) as a function of \( \theta \), with \( u = 1/r \).

We know \( h = r^2 \dot{\theta} \) ⇒ \( \dot{\theta} = h u^2 \).

Also:

\[
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} h u^2
\]
But \( r = 1/u \), so \( dr/du = -1/u^2 \), and \( dr/d\theta = (dr/du)(du/d\theta) = (-1/u^2) u' \), where \( u' = du/d\theta \).

Thus:

\[
\dot{r} = -\frac{1}{u^2} u' \cdot h u^2 = -h u'
\]

Differentiate again for radial acceleration:

\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(-h u') = -h \frac{du'}{dt} = -h \frac{du'}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -h u'' \cdot (h u^2)
\]
\[
\ddot{r} = -h^2 u^2 u''
\]

Now, acceleration in polar coordinates:

\[
\mathbf{a} = (\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) \hat{\mathbf{r}} + (r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}) \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\]

The \( \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \) term is zero because angular momentum conservation ⇒ \( r^2 \dot{\theta} = h \) ⇒ \( 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2 \ddot{\theta} = 0 \) ⇒ \( r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0 \).

So:

\[
\mathbf{a} = \left[ \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 \right] \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Substitute \( \ddot{r} = -h^2 u^2 u'' \) and \( r\dot{\theta}^2 = (1/u)(h^2 u^4) = h^2 u^3 \):

\[
a_r = -h^2 u^2 u'' - h^2 u^3 = -h^2 u^2 (u'' + u)
\]

But from Newton’s law: \( a_r = -\frac{GM}{r^2} = -GM u^2 \).

Thus:

\[
-h^2 u^2 (u'' + u) = -GM u^2
\]
Cancel \( -u^2 \) (nonzero):

\[
h^2 (u'' + u) = GM
\]
\[
u'' + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]

---

## **Step 5: Solve the differential equation**

This is an inhomogeneous linear ODE:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]
where \( A \) and \( \theta_0 \) are constants.

Let \( \theta_0 = 0 \) for convenience (just orientation of axes), so:

\[
u = \frac{GM}{h^2} \left[ 1 + e \cos\theta \right]
\]
where \( e = \frac{A h^2}{GM} \) is dimensionless.

Thus:

\[
r = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos\theta}
\]

This is the equation of a **conic section** in polar coordinates with the origin at one focus:

\[
r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e \cos\theta}
\]
if we identify \( \frac{h^2}{GM} = a(1-e^2) \).

For \( 0 \le e < 1 \), it’s an ellipse ⇒ **Kepler’s first law**.

---

## **Step 6: Kepler’s third law**

For an ellipse, semi-major axis \( a \), semi-minor axis \( b = a\sqrt{1-e^2} \).

Area of ellipse \( = \pi a b \).

From Kepler’s second law: \( dA/dt = h/2 \) ⇒ period \( T \) satisfies:

\[
\text{Total area} = \frac{h}{2} T
\]
\[
\pi a b = \frac{h}{2} T
\]

But \( h^2 = GM \cdot a(1-e^2) \) and \( b^2 = a^2(1-e^2) \), so \( h = \sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)} \).

Also \( b = a\sqrt{1-e^2} \), so:

\[
\pi a \cdot a\sqrt{1-e^2} = \frac{\sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)}}{2} T
\]
\[
\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2} = \frac{\sqrt{GM a} \sqrt{1-e^2}}{2} T
\]

Cancel \( \sqrt{1-e^2} \) (nonzero):

\[
\pi a^2 = \frac{\sqrt{GM a}}{2} T
\]
\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2}{\sqrt{GM a}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
\]

That’s **Kepler’s third law**: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \) with constant \( \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \) independent of the planet’s mass.

---

## **Final summary of derived laws**

1. **First law**: Orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.  
   Derived from solving \( u'' + u = GM/h^2 \) giving \( r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta} \).

2. **Second law**: Equal areas swept in equal times (\( dA/dt = h/2 = \text{const} \)).  
   Derived from angular momentum conservation \( r^2\dot{\theta} = h \).

3. **Third law**: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), specifically \( T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \).  
   Derived from area = \( hT/2 \) and relation \( h^2 = GM a(1-e^2) \), geometry of ellipse.

All three follow from Newton’s law of gravitation and Newton’s laws of motion.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Sun at \( R_0 = 8.5 \text{ kpc} \) from Galactic Centre (GC).
- HI cloud at distance \( R \) from GC, distance \( D \) from Sun.
- Galactic longitude \( l \) measured from Sun–GC line.
- Sun’s orbital angular velocity: \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \).
- Cloud’s orbital angular velocity: \( \Omega = V(R) / R \).
- Galactic rotation clockwise seen from NGP → \( V(R) \) positive in direction of rotation.

Given exact formulas (no approximation yet):

\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

---

## **2. Oort’s approximation for \( D \ll R_0 \)**

For small \( D \), geometry:  
From the triangle Sun–GC–Cloud:

\[
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
\]
and sine rule:
\[
\frac{\sin l}{R} = \frac{\sin(\pi - \phi)}{R_0} = \frac{\sin \phi}{R_0}
\]
where \( \phi \) is angle at GC between Sun and Cloud.

But more directly:  
For \( D \ll R_0 \), \( R \approx R_0 - D\cos l \) to first order in \( D/R_0 \).

Let \( \Omega(R) \) be smooth. Expand:

\[
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
\]
But \( R - R_0 \approx -D\cos l \).

So:
\[
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D\cos l
\]

---

## **3. Relating \( d\Omega/dR \) to \( dV/dR \)**

Since \( V(R) = R \Omega(R) \):

\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = \Omega + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}
\]
At \( R = R_0 \):
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]

Also:
\[
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
\]
At \( R_0 \):
\[
\left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
\]

---

## **4. Oort’s constants \( A \) and \( B \)**

Given:
\[
V_r = A D \sin 2l
\]
\[
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
\]

From exact \( V_r \):
\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
Substitute \( \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D\cos l \):

\[
V_r \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D \cos l \sin l
\]
\[
= - \frac12 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D \sin 2l
\]

Compare with \( V_r = A D \sin 2l \):

\[
A = - \frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]

---

From exact \( V_t \):
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]
Substitute \( \Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) \) with \( R - R_0 \approx -D\cos l \):

First term:
\[
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D\cos l \cdot R_0 \cos l
\]
\[
= - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D \cos^2 l
\]

Second term:
\[
- \Omega D \approx - \Omega_0 D + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D^2 \cos l
\]
The \( D^2 \) term is second order in \( D \), drop for first-order approximation:

So:
\[
V_t \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
\]

Use \( \cos^2 l = \frac12 (1 + \cos 2l) \):

\[
V_t \approx - \frac12 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D - \frac12 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} R_0 D \cos 2l - \Omega_0 D
\]

Group terms:  
Term with \( \cos 2l \): \( -\frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l \)  
Compare with \( V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D \), we already have \( A = -\frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \), so that matches.

Constant term (coefficient of \( D \)):

\[
B D = \left[ -\frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 \right] D
\]
So:
\[
B = -\frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0
\]

---

## **5. Relating \( A, B \) to \( \frac{dV}{dR} \) at \( R_0 \)**

We have:
\[
A = - \frac12 R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]
\[
B = A - \Omega_0
\]
Also \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \).

From earlier:
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\]
But \( R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -2A \).

So:
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 - 2A
\]
And \( \Omega_0 = A - B \) from \( B = A - \Omega_0 \).

Thus:
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = (A - B) - 2A = -A - B
\]

So:
\[
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = - (A + B) }
\]
This is a general kinematic relation, independent of the mass distribution.

---

## **6. Case I: Actual observed rotation curve**

For Milky Way, \( V(R) \approx \text{constant} = V_0 \) in the flat part (observed, due to dark matter halo).

So \( \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0 \).

Thus:
\[
A + B \approx 0
\]
Observationally \( A \approx 15 \ \text{km/s/kpc}, B \approx -15 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \), so \( A+B \approx 0 \), consistent.

So:
\[
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0 }
\]

---

## **7. Case II: Hypothetical Keplerian rotation (mass concentrated at centre)**

Here \( V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \), so \( V \propto R^{-1/2} \).

\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac12 \frac{V}{R}
\]
At \( R = R_0 \):
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac12 \frac{V_0}{R_0} = -\frac12 \Omega_0
\]

But \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \), and \( V_0 \approx 220 \ \text{km/s}, R_0 = 8.5 \ \text{kpc} \).

Numerically:  
\( \Omega_0 \approx 220 / 8.5 \approx 25.88 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \).  
So \( \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx -12.94 \ \text{km/s/kpc} \).

In terms of Oort’s constants:  
From \( \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = - (A+B) \), we get \( A+B = -\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac12 \Omega_0 \).

For Keplerian: \( A = \frac{3}{4} \Omega_0, B = -\frac14 \Omega_0 \) (can be derived from \( \Omega(R) \) relation), but not needed for final \( dV/dR \).

So:
\[
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac12 \frac{V_0}{R_0} }

20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

$\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{t}}&=(\Omega-\Omega_0)R_0\cos l-\Omega D=\frac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](-D\cos l)R_0\cos l-\Omega_0i=\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D\cos^2l-\Omega_0D=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D(1+\cos2l)-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}+\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}D\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the given equations**

We are told:

\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

Here:
- \( \Omega = V(R)/R \) is the angular speed at cloud’s Galactocentric radius \( R \)
- \( \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 \) is the angular speed at Sun’s radius \( R_0 \)
- \( D \) is the distance from Sun to cloud
- \( R \) is the distance from Galactic Centre (GC) to cloud
- \( R_0 \) is the distance from GC to Sun

Geometry:  
From the law of cosines in triangle Sun–GC–cloud:

\[
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
\]
if \( l \) is measured from Sun–GC line toward cloud (usual convention: \( l=0 \) toward GC).

But here, \( l \) is Galactic longitude, so \( l=0 \) is toward GC? Wait — in standard Galactic coordinates, \( l=0 \) is toward GC, \( l=90^\circ \) is direction of Galactic rotation.  
Given \( V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \), that matches the usual formula for differential rotation.

---

## **Step 2: Oort’s approximation for \( D \ll R_0 \)**

For small \( D \), we can expand \( \Omega(R) \) around \( R_0 \):

Let \( R = R_0 - x \) or \( R = R_0 + \Delta R \)?  
Actually, from geometry:  
For small \( D \), \( R \approx R_0 - D\cos l \) if \( l=0 \) toward GC? Let’s check.

From cosine rule:  
\( R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l \)  
For small \( D \), \( R \approx R_0 - D\cos l \) (first order in \( D \)).

So \( \Delta R = R - R_0 \approx - D\cos l \).

---

## **Step 3: Expand \( \Omega(R) \)**

\[
\Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
\]
\[
\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
\]
\[
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \Delta R
\]

But \( \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{ \frac{dV}{dR} \cdot R - V }{R^2} \).

At \( R = R_0 \):

\[
\left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \cdot R_0 - V_0 }{R_0^2}
\]

Let \( V' = \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \).

Then:
\[
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0^2} \cdot (-D\cos l)
\]

---

## **Step 4: Substitute into \( V_r \) formula**

\[
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
\approx \frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0^2} \cdot (-D\cos l) \cdot R_0 \sin l
\]
\[
= -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0} \cdot D \sin l \cos l
\]
\[
= -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} \cdot D \cdot 2\sin l \cos l
\]
\[
= -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} \cdot D \sin 2l
\]

But the problem says Oort found \( V_r = A D \sin 2l \).

So:
\[
A = -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0}
\]

---

## **Step 5: Transverse velocity \( V_t \)**

Given:
\[
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\]

First term:  
\[
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx \frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0^2} \cdot (-D\cos l) \cdot R_0 \cos l
\]
\[
= -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0} \cdot D \cos^2 l
\]

Second term: \( -\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D = -\frac{V_0}{R_0} D \).

So:
\[
V_t \approx -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
\]

---

## **Step 6: Rewrite in form \( V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D \)**

We know \( \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} \).

So:
\[
V_t \approx -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
\]
\[
= -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} D \cos 2l \;-\; \frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} D \;-\; \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
\]

The first term is \( A D \cos 2l \) because \( A = -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} \).

The rest:
\[
-\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} D - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
\]
\[
= D \left[ -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right]
\]
\[
= D \left[ -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 + 2 V_0 }{2 R_0} \right]
\]
\[
= D \left[ -\frac{ V' R_0 + V_0 }{2 R_0} \right]
\]

So \( B = -\frac{ V' R_0 + V_0 }{2 R_0} \).

---

## **Step 7: Final expressions**

We have:
\[
A = -\frac{ V' R_0 - V_0 }{2 R_0}
\]
\[
B = -\frac{ V' R_0 + V_0 }{2 R_0}
\]
where \( V' = \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R=R_0} \), \( V_0 = V(R_0) \), \( R_0 = 8.5 \) kpc.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{A = -\frac{R_0 V' - V_0}{2R_0}, \quad B = -\frac{R_0 V' + V_0}{2R_0}}

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Compact object mass \( M \), radius \( R \) (not directly needed here except that \( R_{\text{min}} \) is the innermost stable orbit, but \( r \gg R_{\text{min}} \) for now).
- Gas element mass \( \Delta m \) starts at radius \( R_{\text{max}} \) in a **Keplerian circular orbit**.
- Slowly spirals inward to radius \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \).
- Ignore gas self-gravity.
- Want: **Total mechanical energy per unit mass** \( \Delta E / \Delta m \) released from \( R_{\text{max}} \) to \( r \).

---

## **2. Mechanical energy in a Keplerian orbit**

For a circular orbit of radius \( a \) around mass \( M \):

- Orbital speed \( v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{a}} \).
- Kinetic energy per unit mass:  
\[
\frac{K}{m} = \frac{1}{2} v^2 = \frac{GM}{2a}.
\]
- Gravitational potential energy per unit mass (Newtonian, zero at infinity):  
\[
\frac{U}{m} = -\frac{GM}{a}.
\]
- Total mechanical energy per unit mass:  
\[
\frac{E}{m} = \frac{K}{m} + \frac{U}{m} = \frac{GM}{2a} - \frac{GM}{a} = -\frac{GM}{2a}.
\]

So for a circular orbit at radius \( a \),  
\[
\epsilon(a) = -\frac{GM}{2a}.
\]

---

## **3. Energy released**

Initially at \( R_{\text{max}} \), energy per unit mass:  
\[
\epsilon_i = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}.
\]

Finally at \( r \), energy per unit mass:  
\[
\epsilon_f = -\frac{GM}{2r}.
\]

The **energy lost** (released) per unit mass is \( \epsilon_i - \epsilon_f \) (since \( \epsilon_f \) is more negative, the gas loses energy as it goes inward):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \epsilon_i - \epsilon_f
= \left[ -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right] - \left[ -\frac{GM}{2r} \right]
= \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right).
\]

---

## **4. Using \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \)**

Given \( R_{\text{min}} / R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 \) and \( r \ll R_{\max} \), we can drop \( 1/R_{\text{max}} \) compared to \( 1/r \):

\[
\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \approx \frac{1}{r}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}.
\]

---

## **5. Final check**

The energy released per unit mass from infinity to radius \( r \) in Keplerian orbit would be \( GM/(2r) \) (since at infinity \( \epsilon = 0 \), at \( r \) it’s \( -GM/(2r) \), difference = \( GM/(2r) \)).

Here we start from \( R_{\text{max}} \), not infinity, but since \( r \ll R_{\text{max}} \), the initial energy is nearly zero compared to final binding energy magnitude, so indeed the result is \( GM/(2r) \).

---

\[
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}
\]

This is the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas spiraling from \( R_{\text{max}} \) to \( r \).",0.728

---

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Mirror initially at distance \( D \) from the Solar System.
- Universe expands according to \( S(t) = s \, e^{H_0 t} \), where \( s \) is the initial separation at \( t = 0 \).
- Here \( s = D \) at \( t = 0 \) when the laser is first emitted.
- The mirror is **fully reflecting** and **maintains its spatial orientation** (so it always reflects back toward the Solar System’s original position? No — careful: the mirror is “in the same plane” orientation-wise, but the expansion carries it away from us).
- The laser beam is sent from Earth at \( t = 0 \), travels to the mirror, reflects, returns to Earth.
- The time between emission and detection is \( T \).
- We want \( H_0 \) in terms of \( D, c, T \).

---

## **2. Motion of the mirror**

Let’s set coordinates so that Earth is at \( x = 0 \) at all times (comoving coordinate? No — physical distance).

Actually, the law \( S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \) is the **physical distance** at time \( t \) if at \( t=0 \) it was \( D \).

So the mirror’s position relative to Earth is:

\[
x_m(t) = D e^{H_0 t}.
\]

---

## **3. Path of light**

Light travels at speed \( c \) relative to local space (we assume no peculiar velocity of mirror, only Hubble flow).

So the **outgoing trip**:  
At emission time \( t = 0 \), the mirror is at \( x = D \), but by the time light reaches it, the mirror has moved farther because of expansion.

Let \( t_1 \) be the time light reaches the mirror.

We need to solve:

Light’s position \( x_{\text{light}}(t) \) satisfies \( dx/dt = c \) in **physical coordinates** (since light speed is \( c \) relative to local observers along its path, but those observers are receding from us due to expansion — careful: actually, in an expanding universe, the coordinate speed of light in **physical coordinates** is still \( c \) if we use proper distance and cosmic time, but the mirror is moving away).

Better: In terms of **physical distance** \( r(t) \) between Earth and light pulse at time \( t \), the pulse’s velocity relative to Earth is \( c \) **plus** the Hubble flow? Wait, no — Hubble flow is not an extra velocity for the photon relative to Earth; Hubble flow is the motion of the mirror itself.

Actually, the photon’s speed relative to Earth is \( c \) in **local inertial frames**, but between widely separated points, the distance increases due to expansion, so the **rate of change of proper distance** for the photon is:

\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = c + H r(t)
\]
where \( H = H_0 \) (constant in steady-state universe).

Why \( c + H r \)? Because the photon moves at \( c \) relative to the local comoving observer, and that observer is receding from Earth at speed \( H r \) at that instant.

So for the **outgoing trip**:

Let \( r(t) \) be the distance from Earth to the photon at time \( t \). Then:

\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = c + H_0 r, \quad r(0) = 0.
\]

---

## **4. Solving for outgoing trip**

The ODE: \( \frac{dr}{dt} - H_0 r = c \).

Multiply by integrating factor \( e^{-H_0 t} \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( r e^{-H_0 t} \right) = c e^{-H_0 t}.
\]

Integrate from \( 0 \) to \( t \):

\[
r e^{-H_0 t} - r(0) = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( 1 - e^{-H_0 t} \right).
\]

Since \( r(0) = 0 \):

\[
r(t) = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{H_0 t} - 1 \right).
\]

We want \( r(t_1) = x_m(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

So:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{H_0 t_1} - 1 \right) = D e^{H_0 t_1}.
\]

---

## **5. Solve for \( e^{H_0 t_1} \)**

Let \( y = e^{H_0 t_1} \).

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} (y - 1) = D y.
\]

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} y - \frac{c}{H_0} = D y.
\]

\[
y \left( \frac{c}{H_0} - D \right) = \frac{c}{H_0}.
\]

\[
y = \frac{c/H_0}{c/H_0 - D} = \frac{c}{c - D H_0}.
\]

So:

\[
e^{H_0 t_1} = \frac{c}{c - D H_0}.
\]

---

## **6. Return trip**

At \( t_1 \), the mirror reflects the photon back toward Earth. Now the photon’s initial distance from Earth is \( r(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

For the return trip, the photon is heading toward Earth, but Earth is receding from it due to expansion? Wait — Earth is at \( x=0 \) fixed in physical coordinates? No, Earth’s position is fixed at \( x=0 \) in physical coordinates (we are using Earth’s rest frame as origin of physical distance). So the photon’s distance from Earth decreases, but the rate of decrease is \( c \) minus something? Actually careful:

On return trip, let \( s(t) \) = distance from Earth to photon at time \( t \) ( \( t \ge t_1 \) ).

The photon moves toward Earth at speed \( c \) relative to local comoving observers, but those observers are moving away from Earth at speed \( H_0 s \). So relative to Earth, the photon’s speed is \( -c + H_0 s \) (since \( s \) decreases if \( -c + H_0 s < 0 \)).

So:

\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = -c + H_0 s, \quad s(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1}.
\]

---

## **7. Solve return trip ODE**

\[
\frac{ds}{dt} - H_0 s = -c.
\]

Multiply by \( e^{-H_0 t} \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( s e^{-H_0 t} \right) = -c e^{-H_0 t}.
\]

Integrate from \( t_1 \) to \( t \):

\[
s e^{-H_0 t} - s(t_1) e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{-c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t} - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right).
\]

But \( s(t_1) e^{-H_0 t_1} = D \).

So:

\[
s e^{-H_0 t} - D = \frac{-c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} + \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1}.
\]

We want \( s(t_2) = 0 \) at return time \( t_2 \).

Set \( s = 0 \), \( t = t_2 \):

\[
0 - D = \frac{-c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_2} + \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1}.
\]

Multiply by \( H_0 \):

\[
-D H_0 = -c e^{-H_0 t_2} + c e^{-H_0 t_1}.
\]

So:

\[
c e^{-H_0 t_2} = c e^{-H_0 t_1} + D H_0.
\]

---

## **8. Use \( e^{H_0 t_1} = \frac{c}{c - D H_0} \)**

Then \( e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{c - D H_0}{c} \).

So:

\[
c e^{-H_0 t_2} = c \cdot \frac{c - D H_0}{c} + D H_0 = (c - D H_0) + D H_0 = c.
\]

Thus:

\[
e^{-H_0 t_2} = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad H_0 t_2 = 0.
\]

That’s suspicious — that would imply \( t_2 = 0 \), which is impossible unless \( H_0 = 0 \). Did I make a sign error?

---

Let’s check: For return trip, \( ds/dt = -c + H_0 s \). If \( H_0 s \) is positive, it’s reducing the speed of approach. But maybe the equation should be \( ds/dt = -c - H_0 s \) if we measure \( s \) as distance from Earth to photon? No — because the local comoving observer sees photon speed \( c \) toward Earth, but that observer is receding from Earth at \( H_0 s \), so Earth’s frame sees photon speed \( -c + H_0 s \). Yes, that’s correct.

But solving gave \( e^{-H_0 t_2} = 1 \) — that suggests \( t_2 = 0 \) unless \( H_0 = 0 \). That means my earlier expression for \( e^{-H_0 t_1} \) might be wrong? Let’s check outgoing equation again.

Outgoing: \( dr/dt = c + H_0 r \), \( r(0)=0 \), solution \( r(t) = \frac{c}{H_0}(e^{H_0 t} - 1) \).  
At meeting: \( r(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

So \( \frac{c}{H_0}(e^{H_0 t_1} - 1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

Multiply by \( H_0 \): \( c(e^{H_0 t_1} - 1) = D H_0 e^{H_0 t_1} \).

So \( c e^{H_0 t_1} - c = D H_0 e^{H_0 t_1} \).

\( e^{H_0 t_1} (c - D H_0) = c \).

\( e^{H_0 t_1} = \frac{c}{c - D H_0} \). That’s correct.

Then \( e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{c - D H_0}{c} \).

Return trip equation: \( ds/dt = -c + H_0 s \), \( s(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).

Integrating factor \( e^{-H_0 t} \):

\( d(s e^{-H_0 t})/dt = -c e^{-H_0 t} \).

Integrate \( t_1 \) to \( t_2 \):

\( s(t_2) e^{-H_0 t_2} - s(t_1) e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{-c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_2} - e^{-H_0 t_1}) \).

But \( s(t_2) = 0 \), \( s(t_1) e^{-H_0 t_1} = D \).

So \( 0 - D = \frac{-c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_2} + \frac{c}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t_1} \).

Multiply by \( H_0 \): \( -D H_0 = -c e^{-H_0 t_2} + c e^{-H_0 t_1} \).

So \( c e^{-H_0 t_2} = c e^{-H_0 t_1} + D H_0 \).

Substitute \( e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{c - D H_0}{c} \):

\( c e^{-H_0 t_2} = c \cdot \frac{c - D H_0}{c} + D H_0 = c - D H_0 + D H_0 = c \).

Thus \( e^{-H_0 t_2} = 1 \) ⇒ \( H_0 t_2 = 0 \) ⇒ \( t_2 = 0 \) if \( H_0 \neq 0 \). Contradiction unless \( H_0 = 0 \).

This suggests **the steady-state expansion law \( S = D e^{H_0 t} \) with constant \( H_0 \) leads to no solution for finite \( t_2 \) unless \( H_0 = 0 \)**? That can’t be right physically — maybe I made error in return trip ODE sign.

---

Actually, think: On return trip, photon is moving toward Earth. In Earth’s frame, the photon’s position \( x_p(t) \) satisfies \( dx_p/dt = -c \) (since space expands, but speed of light relative to Earth isn’t simply \( c \) if we use proper distance — wait, light always moves at \( c \) relative to local matter, but that matter is moving away from Earth at \( H_0 \times\) distance).

Better: Let’s set up in terms of **physical distance from Earth** \( L(t) \) for the photon.

For return trip: At \( t_1 \), photon is at \( L(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \).  
Photon’s velocity relative to **local comoving observer** at \( L(t) \) is \( -c \) (toward Earth). That comoving observer’s velocity relative to Earth is \( H_0 L(t) \) away. So in Earth frame:

\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = -c + H_0 L.
\]

Yes, same as before. That equation’s solution: \( L(t) = \frac{c}{H_0} + \left( L(t_1) - \frac{c}{H_0} \right) e^{H_0 (t - t_1)} \).

We want \( L(t_2) = 0 \):

\[
0 = \frac{c}{H_0} + \left( D e^{H_0 t_1} - \frac{c}{H_0} \right) e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)}.
\]

So:

\[
\left( D e^{H_0 t_1} - \frac{c}{H_0} \right) e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = -\frac{c}{H_0}.
\]

But from outgoing: \( D e^{H_0 t_1} = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{H_0 t_1} - 1) \).

So \( D e^{H_0 t_1} - \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{H_0 t_1} - 1) - \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{H_0 t_1} - 2) \).

Thus:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} (e^{H_0 t_1} - 2) e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = -\frac{c}{H_0}.
\]

Cancel \( c/H_0 \):

\[
(e^{H_0 t_1} - 2) e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = -1.
\]

Let \( A = e^{H_0 t_1} \). Then \( e^{H_0 t_2} = A e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} \).

We have \( (A - 2) e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = -1 \) ⇒ \( e^{H_0 (t_2 - t_1)} = \frac{-1}{A - 2} = \frac{1}{2 - A} \).

So \( e^{H_0 t_2} = A \cdot \frac{1}{2 - A} = \frac{A}{2 - A} \).

But \( A = \frac{c}{c - D H_0} \).

So \( e^{H_0 t_2} = \frac{c/(c - D H_0)}{2 - c/(c - D H_0)} = \frac{c/(c - D H_0)}{(2(c - D H_0) - c)/(c - D H_0)} = \frac{c}{2c - 2D H_0 - c} = \frac{c}{c - 2D H_0} \).

---

## **9. Total time \( T = t_2 \)**

We have \( e^{H_0 T} = \frac{c}{c - 2D H_0} \).

We want \( H_0 \) in terms of \( D, c, T \).

So:

\[
c - 2D H_0 = c e^{-H_0 T}.
\]

\[
2D H_0 = c - c e^{-H_0 T} = c (1 - e^{-H_0 T}).
\]

\[
H_0 = \frac{c}{2D} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}).
\]

This is an implicit equation for \( H_0 \).

---

## **10. Use \( e^x \approx 1 + x \) for small \( x \)**

If \( H_0 T \ll 1 \), then \( e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T \).

So:

\[
H_0 \approx \frac{c}{2D} \left( 1 - (1 - H_0 T) \right) = \frac{c}{2D} (H_0 T).
\]

Cancel \( H_0 \) (nonzero):

\[
1 \approx \frac{c T}{2D} \",0.728
26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the problem**

We have:

- Two identical neutron stars, each mass \( M \), orbiting in a circular orbit of radius \( R \) around their center of mass.
- The orbit is Newtonian, but gravitational waves carry away energy at a rate \( L_{\text{GW}} \).
- \( L_{\text{GW}} \) depends on \( G, c, M, R \) and a dimensionless constant \( \frac{2}{5} \).
- \( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power in the formula.

We must find \( L_{\text{GW}} \) using dimensional analysis plus the given constant.

---

## **Step 2: Dimensional analysis**

We know:

\[
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{M L^2 T^{-2}}{T} = M L^2 T^{-3}.
\]

Constants:

- \( G \) has dimensions \( [G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} \).
- \( c \) has dimensions \( [c] = L T^{-1} \).
- \( M \) has dimensions \( [M] = M \).
- \( R \) has dimensions \( [R] = L \).

We want:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \times G^\alpha \, c^\beta \, M^\gamma \, R^\delta.
\]

---

## **Step 3: Set up dimensional equation**

Let \( k = \frac{2}{5} \) (dimensionless).

\[
[L_{\text{GW}}] = [G]^\alpha [c]^\beta [M]^\gamma [R]^\delta.
\]

Substitute dimensions:

\[
M^1 L^2 T^{-3} = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^\alpha \cdot (L T^{-1})^\beta \cdot (M^\gamma) \cdot (L^\delta).
\]

This gives:

For \( M \): \( 1 = -\alpha + \gamma \).

For \( L \): \( 2 = 3\alpha + \beta + \delta \).

For \( T \): \( -3 = -2\alpha - \beta \).

---

## **Step 4: Solve the system**

From \( T \): \( -3 = -2\alpha - \beta \) → \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \). … (1)

From \( M \): \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha \). … (2)

From \( L \): \( 2 = 3\alpha + \beta + \delta \) → using (1): \( 3\alpha + \beta = 3 \) from (1)? Wait, check carefully:

From \( T \): \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \).

From \( L \): \( 2 = 3\alpha + \beta + \delta \).

Substitute \( 3\alpha + \beta = (2\alpha + \beta) + \alpha = 3 + \alpha \).

So \( 2 = 3 + \alpha + \delta \) → \( \alpha + \delta = -1 \). … (3)

---

We also know \( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power: \( \beta = \delta \).

Then \( \alpha + \beta = -1 \) from (3).

From \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \), subtract \( \alpha + \beta = -1 \):

\( (2\alpha + \beta) - (\alpha + \beta) = 3 - (-1) \) → \( \alpha = 4 \).

Then \( \alpha + \beta = -1 \) → \( 4 + \beta = -1 \) → \( \beta = -5 \).

Then \( \delta = \beta = -5 \).

From \( M \): \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha = 1 + 4 = 5 \).

---

## **Step 5: Check dimensions**

\[
\alpha = 4, \quad \beta = -5, \quad \gamma = 5, \quad \delta = -5.
\]

So:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} \propto G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}.
\]

Dimensions:

\( G^4 \): \( M^{-4} L^{12} T^{-8} \).

\( c^{-5} \): \( L^{-5} T^{5} \).

\( M^5 \): \( M^{5} \).

\( R^{-5} \): \( L^{-5} \).

Multiply \( M \): \( -4 + 5 = 1 \) ✓.

Multiply \( L \): \( 12 - 5 - 5 = 2 \) ✓.

Multiply \( T \): \( -8 + 5 = -3 \) ✓.

---

## **Step 6: Known formula check**

The known quadrupole formula for two equal masses \( M \) in circular orbit of radius \( R \) (orbital separation = \( 2R \) from each mass to CM? Wait — careful: In the problem, \( R \) is the orbital radius of each star from the CM, so separation \( a = 2R \).)

The standard formula for GW luminosity from a binary in circular orbit (Newtonian) is:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 \mu^2 M^2}{c^5 a^5},
\]
where \( M = m_1 + m_2 \), \( \mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{M} \), \( a \) = separation.

Here \( m_1 = m_2 = M \) (each mass \( M \)), so total mass \( M_{\text{total}} = 2M \), reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{M^2}{2M} = M/2 \).

So:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 (M/2)^2 (2M)^2}{c^5 a^5}.
\]

Compute: \( \mu^2 = M^2/4 \), \( M_{\text{total}}^2 = 4M^2 \), product \( = (M^2/4) \cdot 4M^2 = M^4 \).

So:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^4}{c^5 a^5}.
\]

But \( a = 2R \) (since each at distance \( R \) from CM).

So \( a^5 = 32 R^5 \).

Thus:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^4}{c^5 \cdot 32 R^5} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G^4 M^4}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

---

## **Step 7: Compare with our dimensional analysis**

We got \( L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5} \) from dimensional analysis with \( \beta = \delta \) and dimensionless constant \( 2/5 \).

But the known formula is \( \frac{1}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^4 R^{-5} \).

Discrepancy: Our \( M^\gamma \) came out as \( M^5 \) but should be \( M^4 \). Why? Because in the dimensional analysis, we assumed \( L_{\text{GW}} \) depends on \( M \) (each mass) and \( R \) (radius from CM), but actually the relevant mass parameter in the problem is \( M \) (each mass), and the formula involves \( M^4 \) not \( M^5 \).

Let’s check: In our dimensional analysis, we used \( M \) as the mass of each star. But in the real formula, \( L_{\text{GW}} \propto (\text{reduced mass})^2 (\text{total mass})^2 \propto (M/2)^2 (2M)^2 = M^4 \). So indeed \( \gamma = 4 \), not 5.

So our earlier equation \( 1 = -\alpha + \gamma \) should be \( 1 = -\alpha + \gamma \) still, but maybe \( \gamma = 4 \) → \( \alpha = 3 \).

Then \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \) → \( 6 + \beta = 3 \) → \( \beta = -3 \).

Also \( \beta = \delta \) → \( \delta = -3 \).

Check \( L \): \( 2 = 3\alpha + \beta + \delta = 9 - 3 - 3 = 3 \) → fails. So \( \beta = \delta \) is not correct if \( \gamma = 4 \).

---

Given the problem says “\( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power” → \( \beta = \delta \).

Let’s solve again with \( \beta = \delta \):

From \( M \): \( 1 = -\alpha + \gamma \) → \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha \).

From \( T \): \( -3 = -2\alpha - \beta \) → \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \).

From \( L \): \( 2 = 3\alpha + \beta + \delta \) but \( \delta = \beta \) → \( 2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta \).

From \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \), multiply by 2: \( 4\alpha + 2\beta = 6 \).

Subtract \( 3\alpha + 2\beta = 2 \):

\( (4\alpha + 2\beta) - (3\alpha + 2\beta) = 6 - 2 \) → \( \alpha = 4 \).

Then \( 2\alpha + \beta = 3 \) → \( 8 + \beta = 3 \) → \( \beta = -5 \), \( \delta = -5 \).

Then \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha = 5 \).

So indeed dimensional analysis with \( \beta = \delta \) forces \( M^5 \), but the real formula has \( M^4 \). This means the problem’s \( M \) in the statement is **total mass**? Let’s check: If \( M \) in the problem is total mass \( M_{\text{total}} = 2M_{\text{each}} \), then \( \gamma = 4 \) for \( M_{\text{total}} \).

Let \( M_{\text{total}} = 2M_s \) where \( M_s \) is each star’s mass. Then known formula:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G^4 M_s^4}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

But \( M_s = M_{\text{total}}/2 \), so \( M_s^4 = M_{\text{total}}^4 / 16 \).

Thus:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G^4 M_{\text{total}}^4}{16 c^5 R^5} = \frac{1}{80} \frac{G^4 M_{\text{total}}^4}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

But the dimensionless constant is given as \( \frac{2}{5} \), so:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M_{\text{total}}^4}{c^5 R^5} \times \text{?}
\]

We see mismatch: known has \( 1/80 \), ours has \( 2/5 \) times same \( G^4 M^4 c^{-5} R^{-5} \). So maybe \( M \) in the problem is **each mass** and the dimensionless constant \( 2/5 \) is wrong unless we interpret \( R \) differently? Actually, known formula with \( R \) = orbital radius from CM for each mass: \( a = 2R \), so \( 1/a^5 = 1/(32 R^5) \), and \( \mu^2 M_{\text{total}}^2 = (M/2)^2 (2M)^2 = M^4 \), so \( L = \frac{32}{5} G^4 M^4 / (c^5 \cdot 32 R^5) = \frac{1}{5} G^4 M^4 c^{-5} R^{-5} \).

So dimensionless constant = \( 1/5 \), not \( 2/5 \). But problem says “dimensionless constant from GR calculations is \( 2/5 \)” — maybe they define it relative to \( G^4 M^5 c^{-5} R^{-5} \) with \( M \) each mass? Then \( 1/5 M^4 = (1/5 M^4) \) vs \( 2/5 M^5 \) — dimension wrong. So likely they mean: \( L = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5} \) is **incorrect** dimensionally unless \( M \) is each mass and they have an extra \( M \) in numerator by mistake? But \( M^5/R^5 \) has extra \( M \) compared to \( M^4/R^5 \).

Given the problem explicitly says “determine the expression for \( L_{GW} \)” using \( \frac{2}{5} \) as the dimensionless constant, and \( c \) and \( R \) same power, the only dimensionally consistent form with \( \beta = \delta \) is:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}.
\]

But this has \( M^5 \) not \( M^4 \). Possibly they intend \( M \) = total mass, then \( M^5 \) is still wrong (should be \( M^4 \)). So maybe they made a slip in the problem statement, but following their instructions strictly:

**Final answer from their conditions**:

where \( M \) is the mass of each neutron star, \( R \) is orbital radius from center of mass.",0.637
27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the setup**

We have:

- Two identical neutron stars, each mass \( M \), orbiting in a circular orbit of radius \( R \) around their center of mass.
- The **total separation** between the two stars is \( 2R \) (since each is at distance \( R \) from the center of mass).
- The Newtonian orbital angular velocity \( \omega \) is given by:

\[
\frac{GM^2}{(2R)^2} = M \cdot R \omega^2
\]
Wait — careful: The force between them is \( F = \frac{G M^2}{(2R)^2} \).  
Each star’s centripetal acceleration is \( R \omega^2 \), so:

\[
M R \omega^2 = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2}
\]
Cancel \( M \):

\[
R \omega^2 = \frac{G M}{4 R^2}
\]
\[
\omega^2 = \frac{G M}{4 R^3}
\]

---

## **2. Total orbital energy**

The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) for **both stars**:

For one star:  
Kinetic energy: \( \frac12 M (R\omega)^2 \)  
Potential energy: \( -\frac{G M^2}{2R} \) (distance between stars is \( 2R \), so potential energy for one star in the field of the other is \( -G M^2 / (2R) \)).

Actually, let’s compute systematically:

Potential energy of the **system**:

\[
U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}
\]
No, that’s wrong — distance between them is \( 2R \), so \( U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R} \) is incorrect dimensionally. Let’s check: \( U = -\frac{G M^2}{\text{distance between stars}} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R} \). Yes, that’s fine: \( 1/(2R) \) indeed.

Kinetic energy of one star: \( \frac12 M v^2 \), \( v = R\omega \).

From \( \omega^2 = \frac{GM}{4R^3} \), we have \( v^2 = R^2 \omega^2 = \frac{GM}{4R} \).

So kinetic energy for one star: \( \frac12 M \cdot \frac{GM}{4R} = \frac{G M^2}{8R} \).

For two stars: \( K_{\text{total}} = 2 \times \frac{G M^2}{8R} = \frac{G M^2}{4R} \).

Total energy:

\[
E = K + U = \frac{G M^2}{4R} - \frac{G M^2}{2R}
\]
\[
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
\]

---

## **3. Energy loss due to gravitational waves**

Given:

\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
\]

This is the power radiated in gravitational waves.  
By energy conservation (since GWs carry away energy from the orbit):

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = - L_{\text{GW}}
\]

---

## **4. Relating \( \frac{dE}{dt} \) to \( \frac{dR}{dt} \)**

We have \( E = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R} \).

Differentiate with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \right)
\]
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot R^{-2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
\]
Wait, check sign: \( E = -C / R \) with \( C = G M^2 / 4 > 0 \).  
So \( dE/dt = + (C / R^2) \, dR/dt \).

Let’s compute carefully:

\[
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
\]
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
\]
Yes, because derivative of \( -1/R \) is \( +1/R^2 \).

---

## **5. Equating to GW luminosity**

\[
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - L_{\text{GW}}
\]
\[
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
\]

---

## **6. Solve for \( \frac{dR}{dt} \)**

Cancel \( G M^2 \) from both sides (assuming \( M > 0 \)):

\[
\frac{1}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^3 M^3}{5 R^5 c^5}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( 4 R^2 \):

\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5} \cdot \frac{R^2}{R^5}
\]
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
\]

---

## **7. Final expression**

\[
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}
\]

This is the rate at which the orbital radius \( R \) (distance from each star to the center of mass) shrinks due to gravitational wave emission, in the given approximation.",0.49
