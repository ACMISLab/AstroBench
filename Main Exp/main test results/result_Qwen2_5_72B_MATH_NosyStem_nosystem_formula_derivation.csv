Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

Likewise, the planet is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the Sun

From Newton’s second law: both the Sun and the planet accelerate under the action of force

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"To derive the virial theorem, we start with Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on a particle is equal to the mass of the particle times its acceleration. For a system of \( N \) particles, the force on the \( i \)-th particle is given by \( \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i \), where \( m_i \) is the mass of the \( i \)-th particle, \( \mathbf{a}_i \) is its acceleration, and \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the resultant force acting on it.

The virial \( \mathcal{V} \) is defined as the sum of the dot products of the position vector of each particle with the force acting on it:
\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]
Using Newton's second law, we can substitute \( \mathbf{F}_i \) with \( m_i \mathbf{a}_i \):
\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot m_i \mathbf{a}_i
\]
The acceleration \( \mathbf{a}_i \) is the second derivative of the position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \) with respect to time, so we can write:
\[
\mathbf{a}_i = \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
\]
Substituting this into the expression for the virial, we get:
\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
\]
To simplify this, we use the identity for the time derivative of the dot product of a vector with itself:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right) = \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2 + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}
\]
Rearranging this, we have:
\[
\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right) - \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2
\]
Substituting this back into the expression for the virial, we get:
\[
\mathcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right) - \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2 \right]
\]
This can be written as:
\[
\mathcal{V} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right) - \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2
\]
The term \( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2 \) is the total kinetic energy \( T \) of the system:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left| \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2
\]
Therefore, we can write:
\[
\mathcal{V} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right) - 2T
\]
For a system in a steady state, the time derivative of the term \( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \) is zero, so we have:
\[
\mathcal{V} = -2T
\]
The virial theorem states that the average value of the virial over a long period of time is equal to the negative of twice the average kinetic energy. For a system of particles bound by gravitational forces, the virial theorem can be written as:
\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
\]
where \( \langle \mathcal{V} \rangle \) is the average virial and \( \langle T \rangle \) is the average kinetic energy. The potential energy \( U \) of the system is related to the virial by:
\[
\langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = -U
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
-U = -2 \langle T \rangle
\]
or
\[
U = 2 \langle T \rangle
\]
The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy:
\[
E = \langle T \rangle + U
\]
Substituting \( U = 2 \langle T \rangle \) into this equation, we get:
\[
E = \langle T \rangle + 2 \langle T \rangle = 3 \langle T \rangle
\]
Thus, the virial theorem for a system of particles bound by gravitational forces is:
\[
\boxed{2T + U = 0}

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
First, we sum the equations of motion for all \( N \) bodies:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right). \]

Therefore, the right-hand side sums to zero:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \mathbf{0}. \]

This implies that the total momentum \(\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\) is conserved:

\[ \frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \mathbf{0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}. \]

### Step 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum
Next, we take the cross product of the equation of motion for each body with \(\mathbf{r}_i\):

\[ \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right). \]

The right-hand side simplifies because \(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{0}\):

\[ \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j. \]

Now, we sum these equations for all \( N \) bodies:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j. \]

Notice that each term \(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\) in the right-hand side is canceled by the corresponding term \(\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\). Therefore, the right-hand side sums to zero:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \mathbf{0}. \]

This implies that the total angular momentum \(\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\) is conserved:

\[ \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}. \]

### Step 3: Conservation of Energy
Finally, we take the dot product of the equation of motion for each body with \(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i\):

\[ m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}. \]

The left-hand side simplifies to:

\[ m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} v_{i}^2 \right). \]

The right-hand side can be rewritten using the chain rule:

\[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right). \]

Now, we sum these equations for all \( N \) bodies:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_{i} v_{i}^2 \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right). \]

The right-hand side can be simplified by noting that each pair \((i, j)\) is counted twice, so we divide by 2:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} v_{i}^2 \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right). \]

Combining the terms, we get:

\[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} v_{i}^2 - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \right) = 0. \]

This implies that the total energy \( E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} v_{i}^2 - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} \) is conserved:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = \text{constant}. \]

### Final Answer
The first integrals of motion for an N-body system are the conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy:

\[ \boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}, \quad \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}, \quad E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} v_{i}^2 - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|} = \text{constant}}. \]",0.714

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

### Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum
The angular momentum \( L \) of a celestial body in elliptical motion is conserved. The angular momentum can be expressed as:
\[ L = m r v \]
where \( m \) is the mass of the body, \( r \) is the distance from the body to the central body, and \( v \) is the velocity of the body.

At perihelion, the distance is \( r_P = a(1 - e) \) and the velocity is \( v_P \). At aphelion, the distance is \( r_A = a(1 + e) \) and the velocity is \( v_A \). Since angular momentum is conserved, we have:
\[ m r_P v_P = m r_A v_A \]
\[ r_P v_P = r_A v_A \]
\[ a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \]
\[ v_P = v_A \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \]

### Step 2: Vis-viva Equation
The vis-viva equation relates the velocity of a body in an elliptical orbit to its distance from the central body and the semi-major axis of the orbit. The vis-viva equation is:
\[ v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
where \( \mu \) is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body.

#### Velocity at Perihelion
At perihelion, \( r = r_P = a(1 - e) \). Substituting this into the vis-viva equation, we get:
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{a(1 - e)} \right) \]
\[ v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{1 + e}{a(1 - e)} \right) \]
\[ v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}} \]

#### Velocity at Aphelion
At aphelion, \( r = r_A = a(1 + e) \). Substituting this into the vis-viva equation, we get:
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \]
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{a(1 + e)} \right) \]
\[ v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{1 - e}{a(1 + e)} \right) \]
\[ v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} \]

Thus, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are:
\[ v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} \]
\[ v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}} \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}}

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"To find the expression that relates the period \( P \) of the satellite with its distance \( d \) to the center of the planet, we need to use the principles of gravitational force and circular motion. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the mass of the planet inside the satellite's orbit:**
   The planet is cylindrical with radius \( R \) and density \( \rho \). The satellite orbits at a distance \( d \) from the center of the planet. The mass \( M \) of the planet inside the satellite's orbit is the mass of a cylinder with radius \( R \) and length \( L \) (where \( L \) is the length of the cylindrical planet, which is not specified but does not affect the result because it cancels out in the final expression).

   The volume \( V \) of this cylinder is:
   \[
   V = \pi R^2 L
   \]
   The mass \( M \) is the product of the volume and the density:
   \[
   M = \rho V = \rho \pi R^2 L
   \]

2. **Apply the gravitational force and circular motion:**
   The gravitational force \( F \) between the satellite and the planet is given by:
   \[
   F = G \frac{m M}{d^2}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m \) is the mass of the satellite, and \( M \) is the mass of the planet inside the satellite's orbit.

   For the satellite to orbit in a circle, the gravitational force must equal the centripetal force:
   \[
   F = m \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for the force, we get:
   \[
   G \frac{m M}{d^2} = m \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   We can cancel the mass \( m \) of the satellite from both sides:
   \[
   G \frac{M}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   Substitute the mass \( M \) of the planet:
   \[
   G \frac{\rho \pi R^2 L}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi^2 d}{P^2}
   \]
   We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides:
   \[
   G \frac{\rho R^2 L}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi d}{P^2}
   \]
   Rearrange to solve for \( P^2 \):
   \[
   P^2 = \frac{4 \pi d^3}{G \rho R^2 L}
   \]
   Since \( L \) is not specified and does not affect the final expression, we can write:
   \[
   P^2 = \frac{4 \pi d^3}{G \rho R^2}
   \]
   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d^3}{G \rho R^2}}
   \]

Therefore, the expression that relates the period \( P \) of the satellite with its distance \( d \) to the center of the planet is:
\[
\boxed{P = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{d^3}{G \rho R^2}}}

### Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy
For a spiral galaxy, the rotational velocity \( v \) at a distance \( R \) from the center can be used to find the mass \( M_A \) of the galaxy. The relationship between the rotational velocity, the distance from the center, and the mass is given by the formula for the centripetal force provided by gravity:
\[ v^2 = \frac{GM_A}{R} \]
where \( G \) is the gravitational constant. Solving for \( M_A \), we get:
\[ M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \]

### Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy
For a spherical elliptical galaxy, the radial velocity dispersion \( \sigma \) at a distance \( R \) from the center can be used to find the mass \( M_B \) of the galaxy. The relationship between the radial velocity dispersion, the distance from the center, and the mass is given by the virial theorem, which for a spherical system can be approximated as:
\[ \sigma^2 = \frac{GM_B}{5R} \]
where the factor of 5 comes from the assumption of a uniform density sphere. Since the radial velocity dispersion \( \sigma \) is equal to the rotational velocity \( v \) of Galaxy A, we have \( \sigma = v \). Substituting \( \sigma \) with \( v \), we get:
\[ v^2 = \frac{GM_B}{5R} \]
Solving for \( M_B \), we get:
\[ M_B = \frac{5v^2 R}{G} \]

### Final Answer
The masses of Galaxies A and B are:
\[ M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G} \]
\[ M_B = \frac{5v^2 R}{G} \]

At equilibrium, the electron degeneracy pressure equals the gravitational pressure:

Next, we need to express the number density \(n\) in terms of the mass density \(\rho\). The number density \(n\) is the number of electrons per unit volume. Since each nucleus has \(Z\) electrons and the mass of each nucleus is approximately \(Am_p\) (where \(m_p\) is the mass of a proton), the number density of electrons is:

\[ n = \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \]

We know that the mass density \(\rho\) is given by:

\[ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \]

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{\left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)} \]
\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM^2 \rho}{3M} \]
\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM \rho}{3} \]

We can cancel \(\rho\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM \rho}{3} \]
\[ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{\rho Z}{Am_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{4\pi GM \rho}{3} \]

Solving for \(\rho\), we get:

The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Using the property of the dot product \(\vec{m}_1 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})) = 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})\), we can rewrite the expression as:

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"To solve the problem, we need to consider both the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the electron, as well as the orbital momentum of the electron. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Kinetic Energy of the Electron
The electron is orbiting the proton due to the Coulombic attraction. The centripetal force required to keep the electron in orbit is provided by the Coulombic force. The Coulombic force between the electron and the proton is given by:
\[ F = \frac{k e^2}{r^2} \]
where \( k \) is the Coulomb constant, \( e \) is the electric charge, and \( r \) is the radius of the orbit.

The centripetal force required to keep the electron in orbit is:
\[ F = \frac{m_e v^2}{r} \]
where \( m_e \) is the mass of the electron and \( v \) is the velocity of the electron.

Equating the two forces, we get:
\[ \frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r} \]
Solving for \( v^2 \), we get:
\[ v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \]

The kinetic energy \( K \) of the electron is:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_e \left( \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \right) = \frac{k e^2}{2r} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Potential Energy of the Electron
The potential energy \( U \) of the electron due to the Coulombic attraction is:
\[ U = -\frac{k e^2}{r} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Total Energy of the Electron
The total energy \( E \) of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy and its potential energy:
\[ E = K + U = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{2k e^2}{2r} = -\frac{k e^2}{2r} \]

### Step 4: Determine the Orbital Momentum of the Electron
The orbital momentum \( L \) of the electron is given by:
\[ L = m_e v r \]
Using the expression for \( v \) from earlier, we have:
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \]
So the orbital momentum is:
\[ L = m_e \left( \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \right) r = m_e r \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r} \]

### Final Answer
The total energy of the electron is:
\[ \boxed{-\frac{k e^2}{2r}} \]
The orbital momentum of the electron is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}} \]",0.637
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation before and after the collision between the meteorite and the space station. We will use the principles of conservation of momentum and energy, as well as the properties of elliptical orbits.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the space station before the collision
The space station is in a circular orbit with radius \( R \). The speed \( v_2 \) of the space station can be found using the centripetal force equation:
\[
\frac{m_2 v_2^2}{R} = \frac{G M m_2}{R^2}
\]
Solving for \( v_2 \):
\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision
Let the speed of the meteorite just before the collision be \( v_1 \). Since the meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, its speed is purely radial.

### Step 3: Determine the speed of the conglomerate immediately after the collision
The meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate with mass \( m_1 + m_2 \). By conservation of momentum, the speed \( v_c \) of the conglomerate immediately after the collision is:
\[
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_c
\]
Solving for \( v_c \):
\[
v_c = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate
The conglomerate moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of \( R/2 \) from the center of the Earth. This implies that the orbit is elliptical.

### Step 5: Determine the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate
The minimum speed of the conglomerate occurs at the apogee (maximum distance from the Earth), and the maximum speed occurs at the perigee (minimum distance from the Earth). The perigee distance is \( R/2 \).

Using the vis-viva equation for an elliptical orbit:
\[
v^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
where \( r \) is the distance from the Earth and \( a \) is the semi-major axis.

At perigee \( r = R/2 \):
\[
v_{\text{max}}^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

At apogee \( r = r_{\text{ap}} \):
\[
v_{\text{min}}^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r_{\text{ap}}} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

### Step 6: Determine the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth
The semi-major axis \( a \) can be found using the total energy of the system. The total energy \( E \) of the conglomerate immediately after the collision is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R}
\]

For an elliptical orbit, the total energy is also given by:
\[
E = -\frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{2a}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_c^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R} = -\frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{2a}
\]

Solving for \( a \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} v_c^2 - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2a}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} v_c^2 = \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{2a}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} v_c^2 = \frac{2GM}{2R} - \frac{GM}{2a}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} v_c^2 = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
\[
v_c^2 = GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]
\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{R} - \frac{v_c^2}{GM}
\]
\[
a = \frac{GM}{\frac{GM}{R} - v_c^2}
\]

The apogee distance \( r_{\text{ap}} \) is given by:
\[
r_{\text{ap}} = 2a - R/2
\]

### Step 7: Determine the condition that \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) must obey
For the scenario to be possible, the speed \( v_1 \) of the meteorite must be such that the resulting orbit of the conglomerate is elliptical with a perigee of \( R/2 \). This requires that the total energy \( E \) be negative and that the perigee distance be \( R/2 \).

The condition is:
\[
v_1 > \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
\]

Thus, the condition that \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) must obey is:
\[
\boxed{m_1 v_1 + m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} > \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} (m_1 + m_2)}
\]",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, we need to understand the relationship between the apparent magnitude, the solid angle, and the surface magnitude.

1. **Apparent Magnitude and Flux:**
   The apparent magnitude \( m \) of a galaxy is related to its flux \( F \) (the amount of light received per unit area on Earth) by the formula:
   \[
   m = -2.5 \log_{10} F + C
   \]
   where \( C \) is a constant that depends on the units used for the flux.

2. **Flux and Luminosity:**
   The flux \( F \) of a galaxy is related to its luminosity \( L \) (the total amount of light emitted by the galaxy) and the distance \( d \) to the galaxy by the inverse square law:
   \[
   F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}
   \]
   Substituting this into the magnitude formula, we get:
   \[
   m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \right) + C = -2.5 \log_{10} L + 5 \log_{10} d + C'
   \]
   where \( C' = C + 2.5 \log_{10} (4\pi) \) is another constant.

3. **Solid Angle:**
   The solid angle \( \Omega \) subtended by the galaxy at the Earth is given by:
   \[
   \Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}
   \]
   where \( A \) is the physical area of the galaxy.

4. **Surface Magnitude:**
   The surface magnitude \( \mu \) is defined as the magnitude per unit solid angle, typically measured in magnitudes per square arcminute. The total magnitude \( m \) of the galaxy can be expressed in terms of the surface magnitude and the solid angle:
   \[
   m = \mu \times \left( \frac{\Omega}{\text{steradians}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{steradians}}{3282.8 \text{ arcmin}^2} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   m = \mu \times \left( \frac{\Omega}{3282.8 \text{ arcmin}^2} \right)
   \]
   Substituting the expression for the solid angle, we get:
   \[
   m = \mu \times \left( \frac{A}{3282.8 d^2 \text{ arcmin}^2} \right)
   \]
   From the magnitude formula, we know:
   \[
   m = -2.5 \log_{10} L + 5 \log_{10} d + C'
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \( m \), we get:
   \[
   -2.5 \log_{10} L + 5 \log_{10} d + C' = \mu \times \left( \frac{A}{3282.8 d^2 \text{ arcmin}^2} \right)
   \]
   Solving for \( \mu \), we get:
   \[
   \mu = \left( -2.5 \log_{10} L + 5 \log_{10} d + C' \right) \times \left( \frac{3282.8 d^2 \text{ arcmin}^2}{A} \right)
   \]
   Notice that the \( \log_{10} d \) terms and the \( d^2 \) terms cancel out:
   \[
   \mu = \left( -2.5 \log_{10} L + C' \right) \times \left( \frac{3282.8 \text{ arcmin}^2}{A} \right)
   \]
   Since the right-hand side of the equation does not depend on the distance \( d \), the surface magnitude \( \mu \) is independent of the distance to the galaxy.

Therefore, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.}}

17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"To derive Kepler's laws based on the law of universal gravitation, we need to use the principles of classical mechanics and the law of universal gravitation. Here is a step-by-step derivation of Kepler's laws:

### Kepler's First Law: The Law of Ellipses
Kepler's first law states that the orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one of the two foci.

**Derivation:**
1. **Equation of Motion:**
   The law of universal gravitation states that the force between two masses \( m \) and \( M \) is given by:
   \[
   F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{r}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( r \) is the distance between the masses, and \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector in the radial direction.

2. **Second Law of Motion:**
   Newton's second law states that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration:
   \[
   F = m \mathbf{a}
   \]
   Combining these, we get:
   \[
   m \mathbf{a} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{r}
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   \mathbf{a} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{r}
   \]

3. **Orbital Equation:**
   Using the polar coordinates, the radial acceleration \( a_r \) and the tangential acceleration \( a_\theta \) are given by:
   \[
   a_r = \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2
   \]
   \[
   a_\theta = r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}
   \]
   Since the force is purely radial, the tangential acceleration is zero:
   \[
   r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} = 0
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \dot{\theta}) = 0
   \]
   Therefore, \( r^2 \dot{\theta} \) is a constant, which is the angular momentum per unit mass \( h \):
   \[
   r^2 \dot{\theta} = h
   \]

4. **Radial Equation:**
   Substituting \( \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2} \) into the radial acceleration equation, we get:
   \[
   \ddot{r} - r \left( \frac{h}{r^2} \right)^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   \ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
   \]
   Multiplying through by \( r^3 \):
   \[
   r^3 \ddot{r} - h^2 = -GM r
   \]
   To solve this, we use the substitution \( u = \frac{1}{r} \). Then \( \dot{r} = -\frac{\dot{u}}{u^2} \) and \( \ddot{r} = -\frac{\ddot{u}}{u^2} + 2 \frac{\dot{u}^2}{u^3} \). Using \( \dot{\theta} = hu^2 \), we have \( \frac{d}{dt} = hu^2 \frac{d}{d\theta} \). Therefore:
   \[
   \ddot{r} = -\frac{h^2 u^2}{u^2} \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + 2 \frac{h^2 u^4}{u^3} \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right)^2 = -h^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + 2 h^2 u \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right)^2
   \]
   Substituting into the radial equation:
   \[
   -h^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + 2 h^2 u \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right)^2 - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
   \]
   The solution to this differential equation is:
   \[
   u = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
   \]
   where \( A \) and \( \theta_0 \) are constants. Therefore:
   \[
   r = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{h^2}{GM + A h^2 \cos(\theta - \theta_0)}
   \]
   This is the equation of an ellipse, which proves Kepler's first law.

### Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Areas
Kepler's second law states that a line segment joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

**Derivation:**
1. **Area Swept:**
   The area \( dA \) swept out by the radius vector \( r \) in a small time interval \( dt \) is given by:
   \[
   dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
   \]
   The rate at which area is swept out is:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}
   \]
   From the conservation of angular momentum, we know \( r^2 \dot{\theta} = h \), so:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} h
   \]
   Since \( h \) is a constant, the rate at which area is swept out is constant, which proves Kepler's second law.

### Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Harmonies
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

**Derivation:**
1. **Orbital Period:**
   The total area \( A \) of the ellipse is given by:
   \[
   A = \pi a b
   \]
   where \( a \) is the semi-major axis and \( b \) is the semi-minor axis. The total time \( T \) for one orbit is the period, so:
   \[
   T = \frac{A}{\frac{dA}{dt}} = \frac{\pi a b}{\frac{1}{2} h} = \frac{2 \pi a b}{h}
   \]
   For an ellipse, \( b^2 = a^2 (1 - e^2) \) and \( h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2) \), so:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)} = \frac{b \sqrt{GM}}{\sqrt{a}}
   \]
   Substituting \( h \) into the period equation:
   \[
   T = \frac{2 \pi a b}{\frac{b \sqrt{GM}}{\sqrt{a}}} = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{GM}
   \]
   This shows that \( T^2 \) is proportional to \( a^3 \), which proves Kepler's third law.

Thus, the derivation of Kepler's laws based on the law of universal gravitation is complete. The final answer is:
\[

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"To derive the expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, \(\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}\), for the two cases, we need to consider the following:

### Case I: Actual Observed Rotation Curve of the Galaxy

For the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, the rotational velocity \(V\) is a function of the distance \(R\) from the Galactic Centre. The relationship between the rotational velocity and the distance is complex and typically requires empirical data to determine. However, we can use the fact that the Galaxy is in a state of approximate circular motion and apply the centripetal force equation.

The centripetal force required to keep a mass \(m\) in a circular orbit of radius \(R\) with velocity \(V\) is given by:
\[ F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mV^2}{R} \]

This centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force due to the mass \(M(R)\) enclosed within radius \(R\):
\[ F_{\text{gravitational}} = \frac{GM(R)m}{R^2} \]

Equating the two forces, we get:
\[ \frac{mV^2}{R} = \frac{GM(R)m}{R^2} \]
\[ V^2 = \frac{GM(R)}{R} \]
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{GM(R)}{R}} \]

To find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, we take the derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(R\) and evaluate it at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM(R)}{R}} \right) \]
Using the chain rule, we get:
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM(R)}{R} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{GM(R)}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{GM(R)}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{V^2}{R} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2V} \left( \frac{G}{R} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - \frac{V^2}{R} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2R} \left( \frac{G}{V} \frac{dM(R)}{dR} - V \right) \]

At \(R = R_0\), we have:
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = \frac{1}{2R_0} \left( \frac{G}{V_0} \frac{dM(R_0)}{dR} - V_0 \right) \]

### Case II: Hypothetical Scenario with No Dark Matter

In this hypothetical scenario, the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter, and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre. The mass enclosed within radius \(R\) is simply the total mass \(M\) of the Galaxy:
\[ M(R) = M \]

The rotational velocity \(V\) is then given by:
\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \]

To find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, we take the derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(R\) and evaluate it at \(R = R_0\):
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM}{R} \right)^{-1/2} \left( -\frac{GM}{R^2} \right) \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} \]
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{V}{2R} \]

At \(R = R_0\), we have:
\[ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} \]

### Final Answer

The expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, \(\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}\), for the two cases are:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{2R_0} \left( \frac{G}{V_0} \frac{dM(R_0)}{dR} - V_0 \right)} \]
\[ \boxed{-\frac{V_0}{2R_0}} \]",0.728

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

\[ V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \]
\[ V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D \]

For the solar neighborhood where \(D \ll R_0\), we can approximate \(\Omega\) as \(\Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D\). Since \(\Omega = \frac{V}{R}\), we have:

\[ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \left.\frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)\right|_{R=R_0} = \left.\frac{R \frac{dV}{dR} - V}{R^2}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{R_0 \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0^2} = \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{R_0} \]

\[ A \sin 2l = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \sin l \]
\[ A \sin 2l = \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \sin l \]
\[ A = \frac{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}}{2} \]

22,"The accretion of matter onto compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy in astrophysical systems.

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"To find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass \(\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}\) released by the gas as it moves from a radius \(R_{max}\) to a radius \(r \ll R_{max}\), we need to consider the change in the total mechanical energy of the gas element per unit mass. The total mechanical energy per unit mass of a gas element in a circular orbit around a compact object is the sum of its kinetic energy per unit mass and its potential energy per unit mass.

The potential energy per unit mass of a gas element at a radius \(R\) is given by:
\[
U = -\frac{GM}{R}
\]
The kinetic energy per unit mass of a gas element in a circular orbit is given by:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}v^2
\]
where \(v\) is the orbital velocity. For a circular orbit, the orbital velocity is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\]
Thus, the kinetic energy per unit mass is:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{2R}
\]
The total mechanical energy per unit mass is the sum of the kinetic energy per unit mass and the potential energy per unit mass:
\[
E = K + U = \frac{GM}{2R} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2R}
\]
Now, we need to find the change in the total mechanical energy per unit mass as the gas element moves from \(R_{max}\) to \(r\):
\[
\Delta E = E(r) - E(R_{max}) = \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} \right) = \frac{GM}{2R_{max}} - \frac{GM}{2r}
\]
Since \(r \ll R_{max}\), the term \(\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}\) is much smaller than \(\frac{GM}{2r}\), and we can approximate:
\[
\Delta E \approx -\frac{GM}{2r}
\]
Therefore, the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element is:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}
\]
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}

The key point is that the distance between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, which affects the total travel time of the laser beam.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial distance between the Solar System and the mirror is \( D \).
   - The speed of light is \( c \).
   - The time for the laser beam to travel to the mirror and back is \( T \).
   - The distance between the Solar System and the mirror after time \( T/2 \) (the one-way travel time) is \( S \).

2. **Distance Expansion:**
   - According to the law of expansion, the distance \( S \) after time \( t \) is given by \( S = se^{H_0 t} \), where \( s \) is the initial distance and \( t \) is the time.
   - For the one-way travel time \( T/2 \), the distance \( S \) is \( S = D e^{H_0 T/2} \).

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time \( T \) is the sum of the time taken for the laser beam to travel to the mirror and the time taken to return.
   - The time taken for the laser beam to travel to the mirror is \( \frac{S}{c} = \frac{D e^{H_0 T/2}}{c} \).
   - The time taken for the laser beam to return is also \( \frac{S}{c} = \frac{D e^{H_0 T/2}}{c} \).
   - Therefore, the total travel time \( T \) is:
     \[
     T = 2 \frac{D e^{H_0 T/2}}{c}
     \]

4. **Approximation:**
   - Since \( H_0 T/2 \) is likely to be a small quantity, we can use the approximation \( e^{H_0 T/2} \approx 1 + H_0 T/2 \).
   - Substituting this approximation into the total travel time equation, we get:
     \[
     T \approx 2 \frac{D (1 + H_0 T/2)}{c} = 2 \frac{D}{c} + 2 \frac{D H_0 T/2}{c} = 2 \frac{D}{c} + \frac{D H_0 T}{c}
     \]

5. **Solving for \( H_0 \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( H_0 \):
     \[
     T - 2 \frac{D}{c} = \frac{D H_0 T}{c}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by \( \frac{c}{D T} \):
     \[
     \frac{c}{D T} \left( T - 2 \frac{D}{c} \right) = H_0
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     H_0 = \frac{c}{D T} T - \frac{c}{D T} \cdot 2 \frac{D}{c} = 1 - \frac{2}{T}
     \]

   - The expression for the Hubble constant \( H_0 \) is:

This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"To determine the expression for the total gravitational wave luminosity \( L_{GW} \) of the binary neutron star system, we start by considering the dimensions of the quantities involved. The gravitational wave luminosity \( L_{GW} \) has dimensions of power, which is energy per unit time, or \( \text{[M][L]^2[\text{T}]^{-3}} \).

The relevant physical constants and variables are:
- The mass of each neutron star, \( M \), with dimensions \( \text{[M]} \).
- The radius of the orbit, \( R \), with dimensions \( \text{[L]} \).
- The gravitational constant, \( G \), with dimensions \( \text{[M]^{-1}[L]^3[\text{T}]^{-2}} \).
- The speed of light, \( c \), with dimensions \( \text{[L][\text{T}]^{-1}} \).

We need to form a combination of these quantities that has the dimensions of power. Let's assume the expression for \( L_{GW} \) is of the form:
\[ L_{GW} = k G^a M^b c^d R^e \]
where \( k \) is a dimensionless constant. We need to determine the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( d \), and \( e \) such that the dimensions on both sides of the equation match.

The dimensions of the right-hand side are:
\[ [G]^a [M]^b [c]^d [R]^e = \left( \text{[M]^{-1}[L]^3[\text{T}]^{-2}} \right)^a \left( \text{[M]} \right)^b \left( \text{[L][\text{T}]^{-1}} \right)^d \left( \text{[L]} \right)^e = \text{[M]}^{b-a} \text{[L]}^{3a+d+e} \text{[\text{T}]}^{-2a-d} \]

We need this to equal the dimensions of power, \( \text{[M][L]^2[\text{T}]^{-3}} \). Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:
1. \( b - a = 1 \)
2. \( 3a + d + e = 2 \)
3. \( -2a - d = -3 \)

From the third equation, we can solve for \( d \):
\[ d = 3 - 2a \]

Substitute \( d = 3 - 2a \) into the second equation:
\[ 3a + (3 - 2a) + e = 2 \]
\[ a + 3 + e = 2 \]
\[ e = -1 - a \]

Now we have \( d \) and \( e \) in terms of \( a \). Substitute \( b = a + 1 \), \( d = 3 - 2a \), and \( e = -1 - a \) into the expression for \( L_{GW} \):
\[ L_{GW} = k G^a M^{a+1} c^{3-2a} R^{-1-a} \]

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the fact that \( c \) and \( R \) are raised to the same power. Therefore, \( 3 - 2a = -1 - a \):
\[ 3 + 1 = -a + 2a \]
\[ 4 = a \]
\[ a = 4 \]

Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the expressions for \( b \), \( d \), and \( e \):
\[ b = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
\[ d = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 \]
\[ e = -1 - 4 = -5 \]

Thus, the expression for \( L_{GW} \) is:
\[ L_{GW} = k G^4 M^5 c^{-5} R^{-5} = k \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} \]

Given that the dimensionless constant \( k \) is \( \frac{2}{5} \), we have:
\[ L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} \]

This power represents the rate at which the total energy of the system is decreasing. The total energy \( E \) of the binary system in a circular orbit is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. For two identical masses \( M \) in a circular orbit of radius \( R \), the total energy is:

\[ E = -\frac{GM^2}{2R} \]

The rate of change of the total energy is equal to the power radiated by gravitational waves:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{GW} \]

Substituting the expression for \( L_{GW} \), we get:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \]

Next, we need to express \( \frac{dE}{dt} \) in terms of \( \frac{dR}{dt} \). Using the expression for the total energy \( E \), we differentiate \( E \) with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{GM^2}{2R} \right) = \frac{GM^2}{2R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( \frac{dE}{dt} \), we have:

\[ \frac{GM^2}{2R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \]
