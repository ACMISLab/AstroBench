Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"# Derivation of the Virial Theorem

I'll derive the virial theorem starting from Newton's second law and the definition of the virial.

## Step 1: Start with Newton's Second Law

For each molecule in the system:
$$\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} = m\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$$

where $\mathbf{F}$ is the resultant force, $m$ is the mass, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration.

## Step 2: Form the Inner Product with Position Vector

Taking the inner product of both sides with the position vector $\mathbf{r}$:
$$\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$$

## Step 3: Expand the Right Side

Using the product rule for differentiation:
$$\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$$

Since $\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{v}$:
$$\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = v^2 + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$$

Therefore:
$$\mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - v^2$$

## Step 4: Substitute Back

$$\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = m\left[\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - v^2\right]$$

Note that $v^2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}$, and $m v^2 = 2K$ where $K$ is the kinetic energy of the molecule.

$$\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = m\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - 2K$$

## Step 5: Sum Over All Molecules

$$\sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = \sum m\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - 2\sum K$$

$$\sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{d}{dt}\sum m(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - 2E_{\text{kin}}$$

where $E_{\text{kin}} = \sum K$ is the total kinetic energy.

## Step 6: Time Average and Steady State

In a steady-state system or over a time average, the time-derivative term oscillates around zero and averages to zero:
$$\left\langle \frac{d}{dt}\sum m(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \right\rangle = 0$$

## **Final Result: The Virial Theorem**

$$\boxed{\sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = -2E_{\text{kin}}}$$

Or equivalently, if we define the virial as $G = \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F}$:

$$\boxed{G + 2E_{\text{kin}} = 0}$$

Or in terms of total energy:
$$\boxed{2K + U = 0}$$

where $U$ is the total potential energy and $K$ is the total kinetic energy.

3,"<image>GSTD-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, imagine a system in which photons bounce between two mirrors to measure time, with the distance between the mirrors being $L$. If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

## Given Equation

$$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|^{3}}(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j})$$

---

## **1. Conservation of Linear Momentum**

### Derivation:

Sum the equations of motion over all bodies:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|^{3}}(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j})$$

**Key observation:** By Newton's third law, each pair (i,j) appears twice with opposite signs, so the right side vanishes:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = 0$$

### **First Integral:**
$$\boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}}$$

**Meaning:** Total linear momentum is conserved.

---

## **2. Conservation of Angular Momentum**

### Derivation:

Take the cross product of the equation of motion with $\mathbf{r}_i$:

$$m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|^{3}}(\mathbf{r}_{i} \times (\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}))$$

The left side: 
$$\frac{d}{dt}(m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}) = m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$$

On the right side:
$$\mathbf{r}_{i} \times (\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}) = -\mathbf{r}_{i} \times \mathbf{r}_{j}$$

Summing over all i and using Newton's third law (the pair interactions cancel):

$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = 0$$

### **Second Integral:**
$$\boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}}$$

**Meaning:** Total angular momentum is conserved.

## **3. Conservation of Energy**

I'll prove these two important velocity formulas using fundamental orbital mechanics principles.

## Given Information
- Celestial body in elliptical orbit around a central mass
- $\mu = GM$ (standard gravitational parameter)
- $a$ = semi-major axis
- $e$ = orbital eccentricity
- Subscript $P$ = perihelion (closest point)
- Subscript $A$ = aphelion (farthest point)

## Key Principles to Use

1. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**
2. **Conservation of Energy**

---

## Proof

### Step 1: Establish Orbital Distances

At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector.

**Perihelion distance:**
$$r_P = a(1-e)$$

**Aphelion distance:**
$$r_A = a(1+e)$$

### Step 2: Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum

Angular momentum is conserved throughout the orbit:
$$L = r_P v_P = r_A v_A$$

Therefore:
$$a(1-e)v_P = a(1+e)v_A$$

$$v_P = \frac{1+e}{1-e}v_A \quad \text{...(1)}$$

### Step 3: Apply Conservation of Energy

The total mechanical energy is constant:
$$E = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

At any point in the orbit:
$$\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

**At perihelion:**
$$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1-e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1}{1-e} - \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2-(1-e)}{2(1-e)}\right)$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1+e}{2(1-e)}\right)$$

$$v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\cdot\frac{1+e}{1-e}$$

$$\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}}$$

### Step 4: Find Aphelion Velocity

**At aphelion:**
$$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1}{1+e} - \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2-(1+e)}{2(1+e)}\right)$$

$$\frac{1}{2}v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1-e}{2(1+e)}\right)$$

$$v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\cdot\frac{1-e}{1+e}$$

$$\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}}$$

---

## Verification

We can verify using equation (1):
$$v_P = \frac{1+e}{1-e}v_A = \frac{1+e}{1-e}\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{(1+e)^2}{(1-e)^2}\cdot\frac{1-e}{1+e}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$$ ✓

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"# Solution: Period-Distance Relation for a Cylindrical Planet

## Problem Setup

We have:
- A very long cylindrical planet with radius $R$ and density $\rho$
- A satellite orbiting at distance $d$ from the cylinder's axis
- Need to find: $P(d)$ relationship

## Step 1: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

For an infinite cylindrical mass distribution, the gravitational field at distance $d$ from the axis depends only on the mass within the cylinder of radius $d$.

Using Gauss's law for gravity (or direct integration), the gravitational field at distance $d$ is:

$$g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho d}{1}$$

**Derivation:** Consider a cylindrical shell at radius $d$. The mass per unit length inside radius $d$ is:
$$\lambda = \pi d^2 \rho$$

The gravitational field at distance $d$ is:
$$g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \lambda}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \cdot \pi d^2 \rho}{d} = 2\pi^2 G \rho d$$

More rigorously: $g(d) = 2\pi G \rho d$

## Step 2: Orbital Motion Condition

For circular orbital motion, the gravitational acceleration provides the centripetal acceleration:

$$g(d) = \omega^2 d$$

where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{P}$ is the angular velocity.

Substituting:
$$2\pi G \rho d = \frac{4\pi^2}{P^2} \cdot d$$

## Step 3: Solve for Period

Canceling $d$ from both sides:
$$2\pi G \rho = \frac{4\pi^2}{P^2}$$

$$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{2\pi G \rho} = \frac{2\pi}{G\rho}$$

$$\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}}$$

## Key Result

**The period is independent of the orbital distance $d$!**

This is the defining characteristic of orbital motion around an infinite cylinder. All satellites, regardless of their distance from the axis, have the same orbital period.

### Physical Interpretation
- For a sphere: $P \propto d^{3/2}$ (Kepler's Third Law)
- For a cylinder: $P = \text{constant}$ (independent of $d$)

This occurs because the gravitational force in a cylinder increases linearly with distance ($F \propto d$), whereas for a sphere it decreases as $F \propto d^{-2}$.",0.637

## Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)

**Given Information:**
- Radius: R

- Assumption: Circular orbit dynamics apply

**Analysis:**

For a spiral galaxy with circular orbital motion, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{GM_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$

**Solving for Mass:**

$$M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$$

## Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)

**Given Information:**
- Radius: R
- Radial velocity dispersion: σᵣ = v
- Uniform, evenly-spaced stars (uniform density distribution)
- Spherical symmetry

**Analysis:**

For a spherical system in dynamical equilibrium, the **Jeans equation** in spherical coordinates relates velocity dispersion to the mass distribution:

$$\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho(r) \frac{GM(r)}{r^2}$$

For a uniform density sphere, the pressure P relates to velocity dispersion:

$$P = \rho \sigma_r^2$$

Differentiating and combining with the Jeans equation for a uniform density sphere (ρ = constant):

$$\frac{d(\rho v^2)}{dr} = -\rho \frac{GM(r)}{r^2}$$

For a uniform density sphere: $M(r) = M_B \frac{r^3}{R^3}$

After integration at the surface (r = R):

$$\rho v^2 \approx \frac{GM_B \rho}{2R}$$

**Solving for Mass:**

$$M_B = \frac{2v^2 R}{G}$$

| **A** | Spiral | $M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$ | Circular rotation curves |
| **B** | Elliptical | $M_B = \frac{2v^2 R}{G}$ | Jeans equation for uniform sphere |

**Key Insight:** Galaxy B has twice the mass of Galaxy A for the same velocity dispersion characteristic and radius.

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"# Solution: Finding the Density of a White Dwarf

## Step 1: Set up the pressure balance equation

At equilibrium, the electron degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational pressure:

$$p_{electron} = |p_{grav}|$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{\Omega}{3V}$$

Substituting $\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3GM^2}{5R}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}$$

## Step 2: Relate electron number density to matter density

For a star with nuclei of atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$:
- Each nucleus contributes $Z$ electrons
- Each nucleus has mass $\approx A \cdot m_u$ (where $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit)

The electron number density is:
$$n = Z \cdot n_{nuclei} = Z \cdot \frac{\rho}{A \cdot m_u}$$

where $\rho$ is the mass density of the white dwarf.

## Step 3: Express volume in terms of density and mass

The mass of the star is:
$$M = \rho \cdot V$$

Therefore:
$$V = \frac{M}{\rho}$$

## Step 4: Substitute into the pressure balance equation

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(Z \cdot \frac{\rho}{A \cdot m_u}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5 \cdot \frac{M}{\rho} \cdot R}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3} \cdot \frac{\rho^{5/3}}{(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}} = \frac{GM\rho}{5R}$$

## Step 5: Use the relationship for a uniform sphere

For a uniform density sphere: $R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

Substituting this:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3} \cdot \frac{\rho^{5/3}}{(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}} = \frac{GM\rho}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3M}\right)^{1/3}$$

Simplifying the right side:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3} \cdot \frac{\rho^{5/3}}{(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$$

## Step 6: Solve for density

Dividing both sides by $\rho^{4/3}$:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3} \cdot \frac{\rho^{1/3}}{(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}$$

$$\rho^{1/3} = \frac{Gm_e(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}}{​\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3}}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}$$

## Final Result

$$\boxed{\rho = \left(\frac{Gm_e(A \cdot m_u)^{5/3}}{\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}Z^{5/3}}\right)^3 \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)M^2}$$

Or more compactly:

$$\boxed{\rho \propto \frac{m_e A^5}{Z^5\hbar^6}M^2}$$

**Key insight**: The white dwarf density increases as $M^2$, which is why more massive white dwarfs are denser and smaller—they require higher degeneracy pressure to support themselves against gravity.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

- The potential energy of dipole 2 in this field: $U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}$

## Step-by-Step Derivation

**Step 1:** Write the interaction energy as dipole 2 in the field of dipole 1:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$$

**Step 2:** Substitute the magnetic field formula:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}\right]$$

**Step 3:** Factor out constants:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot [3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1]$$

**Step 4:** Distribute the dot product:

$$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} [3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1]$$

**Step 5:** Rearrange to standard form:

$$\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})\right]}$$

- Electron mass: $m_e$
- Proton mass: $m_p$ (where $m_p \gg m_e$)
- Orbital radius: $r$
- Only Coulombic attraction acts between them
- Elementary charge magnitude: $e$

## Part 1: Deriving the Orbital Velocity

Since the proton is much more massive than the electron, we can treat the proton as stationary (the center of mass approximation). The Coulombic force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{ke^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}$$

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_e \cdot \frac{ke^2}{m_e r} = \frac{ke^2}{2r}$$

$$U = -\frac{ke^2}{r}$$

The orbital angular momentum is:
$$L = m_e v r$$

Substituting the expression for $v$:
$$L = m_e \cdot \sqrt{\frac{ke^2}{m_e r}} \cdot r$$

$$L = m_e \cdot \sqrt{\frac{ke^2}{m_e r}} \cdot r = \sqrt{m_e^2 \cdot \frac{ke^2}{m_e r} \cdot r^2}$$

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"# Solution to the Meteorite-Space Station Collision Problem

## Part 0: Shape of the Conglomerate's Orbit

After collision, the conglomerate has:
- **Perihelion (closest approach)**: $r_{min} = R/2$
- **Aphelion (farthest point)**: $r_{max}$ (to be determined)

Since the orbit has two distinct extrema, **the orbit is an ellipse**.

---

## Part (i): Speed of the Meteorite Just Before Collision

**Initial Conditions:**
- Space station orbits at radius $R$ with orbital speed: $v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$
- Meteorite approaches radially (velocity directed toward Earth's center)

**At the collision point (radius R):**

Let $v_m$ = speed of meteorite before collision (radially inward)

**Conservation of angular momentum** (about Earth's center):

The meteorite has zero angular momentum (radial motion). The space station has angular momentum:
$$L_s = m_2 R v_s = m_2 R\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = m_2\sqrt{GMR}$$

After collision, the conglomerate moves at the perihelion with tangential velocity $v_p$ (perpendicular to radius):
$$L_{final} = (m_1 + m_2) \frac{R}{2} v_p$$

Therefore:
$$m_2\sqrt{GMR} = (m_1 + m_2) \frac{R}{2} v_p$$

$$v_p = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

**Conservation of energy** (during collision and orbit):

At radius $R$ before collision:
$$E_{before} = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_s^2 - \frac{GM m_2}{R}$$

At perihelion (radius $R/2$):
$$E_{after} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_p^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2}$$

Since the collision is inelastic but mechanical energy after the collision equals the orbital energy:
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_s^2 - \frac{GM m_2}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_p^2 - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$$

Substituting $v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$ and $v_p = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$:

$$\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM m_2}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)\frac{4m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM m_2}{R} = \frac{2m_2^2 GM}{(m_1+m_2)R} - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$$

$$v_m^2 = \frac{GM}{R}\left[\frac{m_2}{m_1} - 1 + \frac{4m_2^2}{m_1(m_1+m_2)} - \frac{4(m_1+m_2)}{m_1}\right]$$

After simplification:

$$\boxed{v_m = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\frac{5m_1 + 4m_2}{m_1}}}$$

---

## Part (ii): Minimum and Maximum Speeds of the Conglomerate

**Minimum speed** (at aphelion, $r_{max}$):
$$v_{min} = v_a = \sqrt{\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{r_{max}(r_{min}+r_{max})}}$$

Using semi-major axis: $a = \frac{r_{min} + r_{max}}{2} = \frac{R/2 + r_{max}}{2}$

At perihelion (radius $R/2$):
$$\boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \cdot \frac{R/2}{r_{max}}}$$

**Maximum speed** (at perihelion, $r_{min} = R/2$):
$$\boxed{v_{max} = v_p = \frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$$

---

## Part (iii): Maximum Distance from Earth's Center

Using energy conservation for the elliptical orbit:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_p^2 - \frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R/2}$$

$$E = -\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{2a}$$

Solving for $r_{max}$:

$$\boxed{r_{max} = R\frac{5m_1 + 4m_2}{3m_1 + 4m_2}}$$

---

## Part (iv): Condition on $m_1$ and $m_2$

For the scenario to be possible, we need $r_{max} > R/2$:

$$\frac{5m_1 + 4m_2}{3m_1 + 4m_2} > \frac{1}{2}$$

$$10m_1 + 8m_2 > 3m_1 + 4m_2$$

$$\boxed{7m_1 + 4m_2 > 0}$$

This is always satisfied. Additionally, for a physical collision: $\boxed{m_1 > 0, \quad m_2 > 0}$",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"# Solution: Surface Magnitude Independence from Distance

I'll prove that surface magnitude is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe.

## Definitions and Setup

**Surface magnitude** is defined as:
$$\mu = m + 2.5\log_{10}(\Omega)$$

where:
- $m$ is the apparent magnitude of the galaxy
- $\Omega$ is the solid angle subtended by the galaxy (in arcmin²)

## Key Relationships

### 1) Apparent Magnitude and Distance

The apparent magnitude relates to absolute magnitude via the distance modulus:
$$m = M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5$$

where $M$ is the absolute magnitude and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.

### 2) Solid Angle Scaling

In a **non-expanding universe** with a fixed physical size $A$, the solid angle scales with distance as:
$$\Omega \propto \frac{A}{d^2}$$

Therefore:
$$\Omega = \frac{k}{d^2}$$

where $k$ is a constant proportional to the galaxy's physical area.

## Derivation

Substituting the distance modulus into the surface magnitude formula:

$$\mu = m + 2.5\log_{10}(\Omega)$$

$$\mu = \left[M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5\right] + 2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{k}{d^2}\right)$$

$$\mu = M - 5 + 5\log_{10}(d) + 2.5\log_{10}(k) - 2.5\log_{10}(d^2)$$

$$\mu = M - 5 + 5\log_{10}(d) + 2.5\log_{10}(k) - 5\log_{10}(d)$$

The $\log_{10}(d)$ terms **cancel**:

$$\boxed{\mu = M + 2.5\log_{10}(k) - 5}$$

## Conclusion

The surface magnitude $\mu$ depends **only on**:
- The absolute magnitude $M$ (intrinsic property)
- The constant $k$ (physical size of the galaxy)

**Distance $d$ completely cancels out.**

### Physical Interpretation

As a galaxy recedes:
- Its **apparent magnitude increases** (becomes dimmer) by $5\log_{10}(d)$
- Its **solid angle decreases** by $2.5\log_{10}(d^2) = 5\log_{10}(d)$

These two effects **exactly compensate**, making surface brightness independent of distance in a non-expanding universe. This is why we observe Andromeda's low surface brightness regardless of its vast distance—it's an intrinsic property of the galaxy itself.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"# Derivation of Kepler's Laws from Universal Gravitation

## Introduction
I'll systematically derive all three of Kepler's laws starting from Newton's law of universal gravitation and fundamental mechanics principles.

---

## **Starting Point: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**

$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

where:
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of central body (Sun)
- m = mass of orbiting body (planet)
- r = distance between bodies

---

## **KEPLER'S FIRST LAW: Law of Ellipses**

**Statement:** *Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths with the Sun at one focus.*

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** Apply Newton's second law in polar coordinates
$$F = m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} - m r\left(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)^2$$

**Step 2:** For the radial component:
$$-\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} - mr\omega^2$$

**Step 3:** Use angular momentum conservation:
$$L = mr^2\omega = \text{constant}$$

Therefore: $\omega = \frac{L}{mr^2}$

**Step 4:** Substitute into the radial equation and solve the differential equation using the substitution $u = \frac{1}{r}$:

$$\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}$$

where $h = \frac{L}{m}$

**Step 5:** The solution is:
$$r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$

or equivalently:
$$r = \frac{p}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$

where:
- **p** = semi-latus rectum = $\frac{h^2}{GM}$
- **e** = eccentricity (0 ≤ e < 1 for ellipse)
- **a** = semi-major axis = $\frac{p}{1-e^2}$

**Conclusion:** This is the equation of an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. ✓

---

## **KEPLER'S SECOND LAW: Law of Equal Areas**

**Statement:** *A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.*

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** Consider the area swept by the radius vector in time dt:
$$dA = \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta$$

**Step 2:** The areal velocity is:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\omega$$

**Step 3:** Express angular momentum:
$$L = mr^2\omega$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} = \text{constant}$$

**Step 4:** For equal time intervals (Δt₁ = Δt₂):
$$\Delta A_1 = \Delta A_2$$

**Conclusion:** The areal velocity is constant because angular momentum is conserved. This is a direct consequence of the central force being perpendicular to the velocity. ✓

---

## **KEPLER'S THIRD LAW: Law of Periods**

**Statement:** *The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.*

### Derivation:

**Step 1:** For an elliptical orbit, relate the areal velocity to the period:

The total area of an ellipse is:
$$A_{\text{total}} = \pi ab$$

where a = semi-major axis, b = semi-minor axis

**Step 2:** Since areal velocity is constant:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{A_{\text{total}}}{T} = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$$

**Step 3:** From Kepler's Second Law:
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} = \frac{h}{2}$$

where $h = \frac{L}{m}$

**Step 4:** Therefore:
$$\frac{\pi ab}{T} = \frac{h}{2}$$

**Step 5:** Use the relationship $b^2 = a^2(1-e^2)$ and $h^2 = GMa(1-e^2)$:

$$\frac{\pi a\sqrt{a(1-e^2)}}{T} = \frac{\sqrt{GMa(1-e^2)}}{2}$$

**Step 6:** Simplify:
$$\frac{\pi a}{T} = \frac{\sqrt{GMa}}{2}$$

**Step 7:** Solve for T²:
$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM}$$

Or equivalently:
$$T^2 \propto a^3$$

**Conclusion:** The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. ✓

## **Key Conclusions**

1. **Kepler's laws are natural consequences** of Newton's law of gravitation combined with conservation of angular momentum and energy.

2. **The central force nature** of gravity (always directed toward the Sun) is crucial for all three laws.

3. **These laws apply universally** to any two-body system under gravitational attraction.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"# Solution: Radial Gradient of Rotational Velocity

I'll derive the expression for $\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}$ by connecting Oort's constants to the rotation curve properties.

## Step 1: Relate Oort Constants to Angular Velocity Gradient

Starting from the given approximations in the solar neighbourhood:
- $V_r = AD\sin 2l$
- $V_t = AD\cos 2l + BD$

And the exact expressions:
- $V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l$
- $V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\cos l - \Omega D$

For $D \ll R_0$, we can expand $\Omega$ around $R_0$ using Taylor series:

$$\Omega(R_0 + D\cos l) \approx \Omega_0 + \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot D\cos l$$

where I use $R \approx R_0 + D\cos l$ for the radial distance in the Galactic plane.

## Step 2: Extract Oort Constant A

Substituting into $V_r$:

$$V_r = \left(\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot D\cos l\right)R_0\sin l = R_0\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot D\sin l\cos l$$

Using $\sin l\cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2l$:

$$V_r = \frac{R_0}{2}\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot D\sin 2l$$

**Comparing with $V_r = AD\sin 2l$:**

$$A = \frac{R_0}{2}\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \quad \text{...(1)}$$

## Step 3: Connect Angular Velocity Gradient to Velocity Gradient

Since $V = \Omega R$ (for circular orbits), we have:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d(\Omega R)}{dR} = \Omega + R\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$$

At $R = R_0$:

$$\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}$$

From equation (1):

$$\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{2A}{R_0}$$

Therefore:

$$\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \cdot \frac{2A}{R_0} = \Omega_0 + 2A$$

Since $V_0 = \Omega_0 R_0$:

$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} + 2A}$$

---

## Case I: Actual Rotation Curve

For the observed Galaxy with dark matter:
- Oort constant $A$ is determined empirically from observations of HI clouds
- **Expression:** $$\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} + 2A_{\text{obs}}$$

where $A_{\text{obs}} \approx 14.8$ km/(s·kpc) (observed value)

---

## Case II: Hypothetical Scenario (All Mass at Center)

If all Galactic mass $M$ is concentrated at the center:

$$V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \implies V \propto R^{-1/2}$$

Taking the derivative:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{V}{2R}$$

At $R = R_0$:

$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}}$$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

## Step 1: Establish the relationship between angular and rotational velocities

For circular orbits in the Galactic plane:
$$\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$$

At the Sun's location:
$$\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}$$

## Step 2: Taylor expand $\Omega$ around $R_0$

For the HI cloud at distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre:

$$\Omega = \frac{V(R)}{R}$$

Expanding to first order around $R = R_0$:

$$\Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}(R - R_0)$$

## Step 3: Calculate the derivative $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$

$$\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) = \frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}$$

At $R = R_0$:

$$\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}$$

## Step 4: Relate cloud position to Galactic coordinates

For an HI cloud at Galactic longitude $l$ and distance $D$ from the Sun:

$$R - R_0 = D\cos l - R_0(1 - \cos l) \approx D\cos l - R_0(1 - \cos l)$$

To first order in $D$ (since $D \ll R_0$):

$$R - R_0 \approx D\cos l$$

## Step 5: Express $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$

$$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cdot D\cos l$$

$$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left[\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right]D\cos l$$

## Step 6: Substitute into the line-of-sight velocity equation

$$V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l$$

$$V_r = \left[\frac{1}{R_0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}\right]D\cos l \cdot R_0\sin l$$

$$V_r = \left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D\sin l\cos l$$

Using $\sin l\cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2l$:

$$V_r = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D\sin 2l$$

## Step 7: Identify Oort Constant A

Comparing with $V_r = AD\sin 2l$:

$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]}$$

## Step 8: Find Oort Constant B from transverse velocity

$$V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\cos l - \Omega D$$

To first order:
$$V_t \approx \left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D\cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D$$

Using $\cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2}$:

$$V_t = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]D(1 + \cos 2l) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}D$$

Comparing with $V_t = AD\cos 2l + BD$:

$$\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2}\left[\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right]}$$

## Final Results:

$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)}$$

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"# Solution: Mechanical Energy Released in Accretion Disc

## Problem Setup

We have a gas element in a Keplerian orbit around a compact object that spirals inward from radius $R_{max}$ to radius $r$ through viscous dissipation. We need to find the total mechanical energy per unit mass released.

## Step 1: Total Mechanical Energy in Keplerian Orbit

For a particle in a circular Keplerian orbit at radius $\rho$, the gravitational force provides centripetal acceleration:

$$\frac{GM}{ρ^2} = \frac{v^2}{ρ}$$

This gives the orbital velocity:
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{ρ}}$$

The total mechanical energy per unit mass is:
$$e(ρ) = KE + PE = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{ρ}$$

Substituting the Keplerian velocity:
$$e(ρ) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{GM}{ρ} - \frac{GM}{ρ} = -\frac{GM}{2ρ}$$

## Step 2: Energy Released During Inward Spiral

The gas element starts at radius $R_{max}$ with energy:
$$e_{initial} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$$

It reaches radius $r$ with energy:
$$e_{final} = -\frac{GM}{2r}$$

The mechanical energy released per unit mass is:
$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = e_{initial} - e_{final}$$

$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} - \left(-\frac{GM}{2r}\right)$$

$$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$$

## Step 3: Simplification Using $r \ll R_{max}$

Since the condition $r \ll R_{max}$ is given, we have:
$$\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} \ll \frac{GM}{2r}$$

Therefore, the second term is negligible:

$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- **Sign**: Positive value indicates energy is released (the negative binding energy becomes less negative)
- **Dependence on r**: The energy released increases as $r$ decreases—matter spiraling closer to the compact object releases more energy
- **Efficiency**: This formula shows why accretion is so efficient: the binding energy at small radii is very large
- **Dissipation mechanism**: This released energy is converted to thermal energy through viscous stresses in the disc, heating the gas and enabling radiation emission",0.728

We have a mirror initially at distance $D$ from the Solar System. Due to cosmic expansion, this distance increases according to:
$$S(t) = D \cdot e^{H_0 t}$$

A laser is sent to the mirror and returns after total time $T$. We need to find $H_0$.

## Solution

### Step 1: Analyze the Light Travel

Let $t_1$ = time for light to reach the mirror, and $t_2$ = time for light to return.

Since $t_1 + t_2 = T$, we have $t_2 = T - t_1$.

### Step 2: Apply Distance Constraints

**Outbound journey:** Light travels at speed $c$ for time $t_1$, covering the expanding distance:
$$c \cdot t_1 = D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1}$$

**Return journey:** Light travels back from the mirror's position at time $t_1$ to Earth. At time $T$, Earth is at distance $D \cdot e^{H_0 T}$, and the mirror is still at $D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1}$.

The returning light covers:
$$c \cdot t_2 = D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1} - D \cdot e^{H_0 T}$$

### Step 3: Add the Two Equations

$$c(t_1 + t_2) = D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1} + D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1} - D \cdot e^{H_0 T}$$

$$cT = 2D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1} - D \cdot e^{H_0 T}$$

### Step 4: Apply the Approximation

For a Steady-State Universe with small expansion during observation time: $H_0 T \ll 1$

Using $e^x \approx 1 + x$:

$$cT \approx 2D(1 + H_0 t_1) - D(1 + H_0 T)$$

$$cT \approx 2D + 2DH_0 t_1 - D - DH_0 T$$

$$cT \approx D + DH_0(2t_1 - T)$$

### Step 5: Find $t_1$

From the outbound equation with the approximation:
$$ct_1 \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)$$

$$ct_1 \approx D + DH_0 t_1$$

$$t_1(c - DH_0) \approx D$$

For $DH_0 \ll c$:
$$t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c}\left(1 + \frac{DH_0}{c}\right)$$

### Step 6: Solve for $H_0$ (First-Order Approximation)

To leading order, assuming the dominant correction is from the return journey:

$$cT \approx 2D - D(1 + H_0T/2) + \text{higher order terms}$$

More directly, the round-trip distance in an expanding universe is effectively:
$$cT \approx 2D(1 + H_0 T/2)$$

$$cT \approx 2D + DH_0 T$$

$$cT - 2D = DH_0 T$$

## **Final Result:**

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{cT - 2D}{DT} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}}$$

Or equivalently:

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c - 2D/T}{D}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The Hubble constant is determined by comparing the deviation of the total travel time $T$ from the naive expectation $2D/c$ (what it would be without expansion) to the initial distance $D$.",0.728
26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"# Solution: Gravitational Wave Luminosity for Binary Neutron Stars

## Part 1: Deriving the Dimensional Formula

I need to find an expression of the form:
$$L_{GW} = \text{constant} \times G^a c^b M^d R^e$$

where $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power, meaning $b = -e$.

### Setting up the Dimensional Equation

**Dimensions of each quantity:**
- $[L_{GW}]$ = Power = $ML^2T^{-3}$
- $[G]$ = $M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}$
- $[c]$ = $LT^{-1}$
- $[M]$ = $M$
- $[R]$ = $L$

### Writing the Dimensional Constraint

$$ML^2T^{-3} = (M^{-1}L^3T^{-2})^a (LT^{-1})^b M^d L^e$$

Expanding:
$$ML^2T^{-3} = M^{-a+d} L^{3a+b+e} T^{-2a-b}$$

### Solving the System of Equations

Equating exponents for each dimension:

**Mass:** $1 = -a + d$ → $d = a + 1$ ... (1)

**Time:** $-3 = -2a - b$ → $b = 2a - 3$ ... (2)

**Length:** $2 = 3a + b + e$ ... (3)

**Constraint:** $b = -e$ (given that $c$ and $R$ have same power)

From $b = -e$:
$$e = -b = -(2a - 3) = 3 - 2a$$

Substituting into equation (3):
$$2 = 3a + (2a - 3) + (3 - 2a)$$
$$2 = 3a$$
$$a = \frac{2}{3}$$

Therefore:
- $a = \frac{2}{3}$
- $b = 2(\frac{2}{3}) - 3 = \frac{4}{3} - 3 = -\frac{5}{3}$
- $e = -b = \frac{5}{3}$
- $d = \frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{5}{3}$

## Part 2: The Final Expression

$$\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^{2/3}}{c^{5/3}} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^{5/3}}}$$

**Alternative forms:**

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^{2/3} M^{5/3}}{c^{5/3} R^{5/3}}$$

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \left(\frac{GM}{c^3}\right)^{5/3} \left(\frac{c}{R}\right)^{5/3}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- **Power law dependence:** $L_{GW} \propto M^{5/3}/R^{5/3}$
- **Strong mass dependence:** More massive systems radiate much more efficiently
- **Inverse power of separation:** Closer binaries radiate more strongly
- **As $R$ decreases** (due to radiation losses), $L_{GW}$ increases, causing acceleration of the orbital decay—this is the runaway process leading to neutron star mergers",0.637

Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"# Solution: Rate of Change of Orbital Radius Due to Gravitational Wave Radiation

## Step 1: Establish the Energy-Radius Relationship

For a binary system with two identical masses $M$ in circular orbit around their common center of mass, each at distance $R$ from the center, the total orbital energy is:

$$E = -\frac{GM^2}{2R}$$

This can be derived from the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of the circular orbit.

## Step 2: Apply Energy Conservation with Gravitational Wave Loss

The rate of energy loss equals the gravitational wave luminosity:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{GW}$$

where the negative sign indicates energy is being radiated away.

## Step 3: Compute $\frac{dE}{dt}$ Using the Chain Rule

Using the chain rule with the hint provided:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(-\frac{GM^2}{2R}\right) = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(R^{-1})$$

Applying the hint with $\alpha = -1$:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot (-1) \cdot R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{dR}{dt}$$

## Step 4: Substitute the Gravitational Wave Expression

$$\frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$$

## Step 5: Solve for $\frac{dR}{dt}$

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5} \cdot \frac{2R^2}{GM^2}$$

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The negative sign indicates that the orbital radius decreases with time. The system loses energy through gravitational wave radiation, causing the neutron stars to spiral inward toward each other, a phenomenon confirmed by observations of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar system.",0.49
