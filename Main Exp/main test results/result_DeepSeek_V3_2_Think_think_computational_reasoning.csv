1,"You are an astronaut exploring a newly discovered planet Y. Planet Y has a mass that is 4.32 times the mass of Earth and a radius that is 0.70 times the radius of Earth.

If your mass is 78.1 kg, determine:
1. The formula for the gravitational force acting on you on Earth.
2. The gravitational force acting on you on planet Y.
3. How the gravitational force on planet Y compares to that on Earth.","### Step 1: Gravitational force on Earth
The gravitational force experienced by an object of mass $m$ on Earth is given by

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Earth}} m}{R_{\text{Earth}}^2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
F_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{(6.67430 \times 10^{-11})(5.972 \times 10^{24})(78.1)}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2}
\]

This gives:
\[
F_{\text{Earth}} \approx 767.24\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 2: Gravitational force on planet Y
The same formula applies, but with the planet's mass and radius:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Y}} m}{R_{\text{Y}}^2}
\]

where:
- $M_{\text{Y}} = 4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}$
- $R_{\text{Y}} = 0.70 R_{\text{Earth}}$

Substituting:

\[
F_{\text{Y}} = \frac{G (4.32 M_{\text{Earth}}) m}{(0.70 R_{\text{Earth}})^2}
\]

Numerically, this yields:
\[
F_{\text{Y}} \approx 6792.57\ \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Comparison of forces
The ratio of the gravitational force on planet Y to that on Earth is:

\[
\frac{F_{\text{Y}}}{F_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{4.32}{(0.70)^2}
\]

Thus, the gravitational force on planet Y is approximately 8.85 times the force experienced on Earth.","Gravitational force on Earth: 767.24 N

Using the vis-viva equation:
v = √[ μ ( 2/r − 1/a ) ]

Velocity at periapsis (r₁): vₚ = 1.280 km/s
Velocity at apoapsis (r₂): vₐ = 0.739 km/s

ΔV₁ = vₚ − v₁ = 0.143 km/s
ΔV₂ = v₂ − vₐ = 0.125 km/s

The transfer time is half the period of the elliptical orbit:
t = π √(aₜ³ / μ)

t = 107503 s ≈ 29.86 hours

### Bonus Explanation
At very large orbital altitudes, the circular orbital velocity approaches the escape velocity of the planet. Any additional ΔV required to circularize the orbit may exceed the escape velocity, causing the spacecraft to leave the planet’s gravitational influence rather than remain in a bound orbit.","ΔV₁ = 0.143 km/s, ΔV₂ = 0.125 km/s

For a conic-section trajectory, the flight path angle \(\gamma\) is related to
the true anomaly \(\nu\) and eccentricity \(e\) by:

\[
\tan \gamma = \frac{e \sin \nu}{1 + e \cos \nu}
\]

---

**Step 2: Substitute known values**

Given:
- \( e = 2.813 \)
- \( \gamma = -86.66^\circ \)

Convert the flight path angle to radians:

\[
\gamma = -86.66^\circ

Compute:

\[
\tan \gamma = -17.12682

---

**Step 3: Rearrange the equation**

Rewriting the equation:

\[
e \sin \nu - e \tan \gamma \cos \nu = \tan \gamma
\]

This can be expressed in the form:

\[
A \sin \nu + B \cos \nu = C
\]

where:

\[
A = e = 2.81275
\]
\[
B = -e \tan \gamma = 48.17352

\[
C = \tan \gamma = -17.12682

  a  = (2.249)(AU) = 336,402,162.599 km

Step 2: Apply the one-tangent condition (departure at periapsis).
  For an ellipse, periapsis radius is:
    r_p = a(1 - e)
  With r_p = r₁, solve for eccentricity e:

Assume the spacecraft departs from perihelion, so the initial eccentric anomaly is E₁ = 0.

For an elliptical orbit, the radial distance r is related to the eccentric anomaly E by:

\[
r = a (1 - e \cos E)
\]

Since the spacecraft departs from perihelion, the initial eccentric anomaly is:

\[
E_1 = 0

Rearranging the radial distance equation to solve for E at intercept:

\[
\cos E_2 = \frac{1 - r/a}{e}

Substituting the given values:

\[
\cos E_2 = \frac{1 - 1.930/1.928}{0.299} = -0.004590
\]

Taking the inverse cosine:

\[
E_2 = \arccos(-0.004590) = 1.575386 \text{ radians}

Because E₁ = 0, the change in eccentric anomaly is:

\[

  ""solution"": ""The change in eccentric anomaly ΔE is computed by finding the eccentric anomaly E at the planetary intercept point, since the initial eccentric anomaly E₁ = 0 at perihelion.

Substituting the given values: a = 1.928 AU, e = 0.299, and r = 1.930 AU, we solve for E. First, compute r/a = 1.930 / 1.928 ≈ 1.00103734. Then, from r/a = 1 - e cos E, we have e cos E = 1 - r/a ≈ -0.00103734. Thus, cos E = (1 - r/a)/e ≈ -0.00103734 / 0.299 ≈ -0.0034695. Since cos E is negative and small, E is slightly greater than π/2.

r_1 = \sqrt{(-0.872604)^2 + (0.434562)^2} = 0.974824\,\text{AU}
\]

\[
r_2 = \sqrt{(1.481159)^2 + (-0.414898)^2 + (0.096781)^2} = 1.541213\,\text{AU}
\]

**2. Initial estimate of the semi-major axis**

For an interplanetary transfer, a common initial guess is the average of the departure and arrival radii:

\[
a_0 = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2} = 1.258019\,\text{AU}
\]

**3. Convert quantities to SI units**

\[
a_0 = 1.258019\,\text{AU} = 1.882e+11\,\text{m}
\]

\[
T_{\text{flight}} = 256.4\times 24 \times 3600 = 2.215e+07\,\text{s}
\]

**4. Estimate orbital period using Kepler’s Third Law**

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a_0^3}{\mu}}
\]

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{(1.882e+11)^3}{1.327e+20}} = 4.453e+07\,\text{s}
\]

**5. Refine the semi-major axis**

The transfer time corresponds approximately to half of the orbital period. A refinement factor is applied:

\[
f = \frac{T_{\text{flight}}}{0.5\,T} = 0.994824
\]

The refined semi-major axis is then:

\[
a = a_0 \cdot f^{2/3} = 1.253674\,\text{AU}
\]

1. Based on these vectors, where is the satellite currently located in its orbit?","### Step 1: Interpret the position vector
The position vector is aligned entirely along the \( +\hat{I} \) direction.

\[
\vec{R} = R_x \hat{I}, \quad R_y = 0, \quad R_z = 0
\]

This indicates that the satellite lies on the Earth's equatorial plane (since the \( z \)-component is zero) and is located on the positive x-axis.

### Step 2: Interpret the velocity vector
The velocity vector has no \( x \)-component, but has equal-magnitude \( y \) and \( z \) components with opposite signs:

\[
V_y = 3.531 \text{ km/s}, \quad V_z = -3.531 \text{ km/s}
\]

A negative \( z \)-component indicates motion toward the southern hemisphere, while the positive \( y \)-component indicates eastward motion.

### Step 3: Determine orbital location
Since the satellite is crossing the equatorial plane (\( z = 0 \)) and moving from north to south (negative \( V_z \)), it must be at the **descending node**.

The alignment with the x-axis confirms this interpretation.",The satellite is located on the Earth's equatorial plane at the **descending node** of its orbit.,No,"{
  ""solution"": ""To determine the satellite's location in its orbit, we analyze the given position and velocity vectors in the ECI frame.

First, compute the dot product \( \vec{R} \cdot \vec{V} = 0 \), indicating that the velocity is perpendicular to the position vector, so the radial velocity is zero. This occurs at an apsis (periapsis or apogee). Next, compute the magnitudes: \( R = 10000 \, \text{km} \) and \( V \approx 4.9936 \, \text{km/s} \). Compare this with the circular orbit speed at radius \( R \): \( V_c = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{R}} \approx 6.313 \, \text{km/s} \), where \( \mu = 398600 \, \text{km}^3/\text{s}^2 \) for Earth. Since \( V < V_c \), the satellite is moving slower than circular speed at this radius, which is characteristic of apogee. Further confirmation comes from computing the specific mechanical energy \( \epsilon \approx -27.392 \, \text{km}^2/\text{s}^2 \) (negative, indicating an elliptical orbit) and the eccentricity vector \( \vec{e} \approx -0.3744 \hat{I} \), with magnitude \( e \approx 0.3744 \). The true anomaly \( \nu \) is the angle between \( \vec{e} \) and \( \vec{R} \); since \( \vec{e} \cdot \vec{R} = -eR \), \( \nu = 180^\circ \), which corresponds to apogee when periapsis is at \( \nu = 0^\circ \).

246,"A satellite is in a circular orbit with an orbital period of 3.24 hours. The satellite starts with an initial argument of latitude of 189.8°. 

If the satellite travels for 10.72 hours, what is the final argument of latitude, $u_f$? 

Provide your answer in degrees.","### Step-by-Step Solution

**1. Determine the mean motion**

The mean motion, $n$, is the angular rate at which the satellite moves along its orbit:

\[
n = \frac{360^\circ}{T} = \frac{360^\circ}{3.24\,\text{hours}} = 111.06^\circ/\text{hour}
\]

**2. Compute the total angular travel during the time of flight**

The total change in argument of latitude over the travel time is:

\[
\Delta u = n \times t = 111.06^\circ/\text{hour} \times 10.72\,\text{hours} = 1190.63^\circ
\]

**3. Add the initial argument of latitude**

The unwrapped final argument of latitude is:

\[
u_f = u_i + \Delta u = 189.8^\circ + 1190.63^\circ = 1380.45^\circ
\]

**4. Normalize the result to the range 0°–360°**

Since angular position is cyclic, subtract full revolutions of 360°:

\[
u_f = 1380.45^\circ \bmod 360^\circ = 300.45^\circ
\]",$u_f = 300.45^\circ$,No,"{
  ""solution"": ""The satellite's mean motion is given by n = 360° / T, where T = 3.24 hours is the orbital period. Thus, n = 360 / 3.24 = 1000/9 °/hr ≈ 111.111°\/hr. The angular distance traveled in t = 10.72 hours is Δθ = n × t = (1000/9) × 10.72 = (1000/9) × (268/25) = 10720/9 ° ≈ 1191.111°. The initial argument of latitude is u₀ = 189.8°. Adding the angular travel gives u_total = u₀ + Δθ = 189.8 + 1191.111 = 1380.911°. Since the argument of latitude is an angle modulo 360°, we subtract the number of complete revolutions. The number of full revolutions is floor(1380.911/360) = 3, and 3 × 360 = 1080°. Thus, the final argument of latitude is u_f = 1380.911° - 1080° = 300.911°.

First, compute sin δ from the third equation: sin δ = sin(44.3°) sin(6.5°) + cos(44.3°) cos(6.5°) cos(19.5°) ≈ 0.6982 × 0.1132 + 0.7159 × 0.9936 × 0.9426 ≈ 0.0790 + 0.6706 = 0.7496.

303,"A spherical star cluster, which appears from Earth under a solid angle of 0.000194 sr, contains approximately 344,538 stars and has an apparent bolometric magnitude of m_bol = 4.91 mag. The spherical cluster is at rest, meaning the velocities of the stars are zero.

Estimate the distance to the cluster as well as the mean angular separation between its stars. Ignore interstellar extinction. Also, compute the objective lens diameter of a telescope required to distinguish two stars of the cluster in the optical. State any assumptions you made.","Step 1: Estimate the total luminosity of the cluster.
Assume all stars are Sun-like, so each has luminosity L_⊙. Then the total luminosity is
L = N L_⊙  ⇒  L/L_⊙ = N.
Convert luminosity to absolute bolometric magnitude using Pogson’s law:
M_bol = M_{bol,⊙} − 2.5 log10(L/L_⊙)
M_bol = 4.80 − 2.5 log10(344538) = -9.04

Step 2: Use the distance modulus (no extinction) to solve for distance.
m_bol − M_bol = 5 log10(d/pc) − 5
⇒ d = 10^{(m_bol − M_bol + 5)/5} pc
d = 10^((4.91 − (-9.04) + 5)/5) = 6.17e+03 pc

Step 3: Estimate the mean angular separation between stars.
Assume the stars are uniformly distributed across the cluster’s apparent solid angle Ω.
Then the mean solid angle per star is
Ω_star = Ω / N.
Ω_star = (0.000194) / (344538) = 5.645e-10 sr
A characteristic angular spacing θ can be estimated by treating Ω_star ~ θ^2:
θ ≈ sqrt(Ω_star)
θ ≈ sqrt(5.645e-10) = 2.376e-05 rad ≈ 4.90 arcsec

Step 4: Telescope diameter needed to resolve two stars (diffraction limit).
Using the Rayleigh criterion for a circular aperture:
θ = 1.22 λ / D  ⇒  D = 1.22 λ / θ
Take λ = 5.000e-07 m (optical).
D = 1.22(5.000e-07)/(2.376e-05) = 2.57e-02 m

  ""solution"": ""To solve the problem, we break it down into three parts: estimating the mean angular separation, the distance to the cluster, and the telescope diameter required to resolve stars.\n\n1. **Mean Angular Separation**: The cluster appears under a solid angle Ω = 0.000194 sr and contains N = 344,538 stars. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the mean angular separation δθ is approximated by δθ = √(Ω / N). Calculating: Ω / N = 0.000194 / 344,538 ≈ 5.630 × 10^{-10} sr, so δθ = √(5.630 × 10^{-10}) ≈ 2.373 × 10^{-5} rad. Converting to arcseconds (1 rad = 206265 arcsec), δθ ≈ 2.373 × 10^{-5} × 206265 ≈ 4.89 arcsec.\n\n2. **Distance to the Cluster**: The apparent bolometric magnitude is m_bol = 4.91 mag. We assume each star has an absolute bolometric magnitude similar to the Sun, M_star = 4.74 mag. The total absolute magnitude of the cluster is M_cluster = M_star - 2.5 log₁₀(N). With log₁₀(344,538) ≈ 5.5372, M_cluster ≈ 4.74 - 2.5 × 5.5372 ≈ -9.103 mag. Using the distance modulus m - M = 5 log₁₀(d) - 5, where d is in parsecs: 4.91 - (-9.103) = 14.013, so 5 log₁₀(d) = 14.013 + 5 = 19.013, log₁₀(d) ≈ 3.8026, and d ≈ 10^{3.8026} ≈ 6340 pc.\n\n3. **Telescope Diameter**: To distinguish two stars, the telescope's angular resolution θ_min must be at least as good as δθ. Using the Rayleigh criterion, θ_min = 1.22 λ / D, where λ is the wavelength. For optical light, assume λ = 500 nm = 5.00 × 10^{-7} m. Setting θ_min = δθ = 2.373 × 10^{-5} rad, we solve for D: D = 1.22 λ / δθ ≈ 1.22 × 5.00 × 10^{-7} / 2.373 × 10^{-5} ≈ 2.57 × 10^{-2} m = 2.57 cm.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Each star in the cluster has a bolometric luminosity similar to the Sun (M_bol = 4.74 mag).\n- Stars are uniformly distributed within the cluster's angular area.\n- For telescope resolution, optical wavelength λ = 500 nm is used.\n- Interstellar extinction is ignored as specified.\n- The cluster is spherical and appears as a circular region with solid angle Ω."",

The transfer consists of two instantaneous burns and has a total delta-v of

    Δv = k √(GM / R).

Compute the dimensionless coefficient k.","Step 1: Use the vis-viva equation for orbital speed:

    v = √[ GM ( 2/r − 1/a ) ].

The initial orbit is circular with radius r = R, so its speed is

    v₁ = √(GM / R).

The transfer orbit is an ellipse with periapsis R and apoapsis αR, so its semi-major axis is

    a = (R + αR)/2 = (α + 1)R / 2.

Evaluating the speed on the transfer orbit at r = R gives

    v_p = √(GM / R) √(2α / (α + 1)).

Thus, the first burn is

    Δv₁ = √(GM / R) [ √(2α / (α + 1)) − 1 ].

Step 2: At the outer orbit (r = αR), the circular orbital speed is

    v₂ = √(GM / (αR)) = √(GM / R) · 1/√α.

The speed on the transfer orbit at r = αR is

    v_a = √(GM / R) · (1/√α) √(2 / (α + 1)).

The second burn is therefore

    Δv₂ = √(GM / R) · (1/√α) [ 1 − √(2 / (α + 1)) ].

Step 3: Add the two burns to obtain the total delta-v:

    Δv = √(GM / R) { √(2α / (α + 1)) − 1
          + (1/√α)[ 1 − √(2 / (α + 1)) ] }.

The pericenter distance is r_p = R + h_min = 4180 + 1609 = 5789 km.
The apocenter distance is r_a = R + h_max = 4180 + 5635 = 9815 km.
Thus, the semi-major axis is

For the satellite around the planet:
T_sat = 2π√(a_sat³ / Gm).
For the planet around the star:
T_p = 2π√(a_p³ / GM).

Step 3: Divide the two equations and simplify, using m_sat ≪ m ≪ M.
(T_p / T_sat)² = (a_p³ / a_sat³) · (m / M).

311,"Evan uses a telescope of focal distance f = 688 mm to observe a star known to have a parallax p = 93 mas. Observing the CCD of the telescope, Evan notices that the star has a diameter D = 0.949 µm. Furthermore, he measures its apparent magnitude to be m = 7.24. What is the approximate temperature of this star? Please, neglect the atmospheric seeing in your calculations.","Step 1: Use parallax to find the distance.
With p in arcseconds, d(pc) = 1/p.
p = 93 mas = 0.093 arcsec
d = 1/0.093 = 10.8 pc
Convert to meters: d = (10.8)(3.086×10^16 m) = 3.318e+17 m

Step 2: Convert the CCD spot size into an angular radius (small-angle approximation).
A linear radius x on the focal plane corresponds to angle θ ≈ x/f.
f = 688 mm = 6.881e-01 m
D = 0.949 µm = 9.487e-07 m, so x = D/2 = 4.743e-07 m
θ = x/f = (4.743e-07)/(6.881e-01) = 6.893e-07 rad
Then the stellar radius is R = θ d:
R = (6.893e-07)(3.318e+17) = 2.287e+11 m

Step 3: Compute the Sun’s apparent magnitude from the distance modulus at 1 AU.
m_⊙ − M_⊙ = 5 log10(a_pc) − 5, where a_pc is 1 AU in parsecs.
a_pc = AU/pc = (1.496e+11)/(3.086e+16) = 4.848e-06 pc
m_⊙ = M_⊙ + 5 log10(a_pc) − 5 = 4.83 + 5 log10(4.848e-06) − 5 = -26.74

Step 4: Use Pogson’s relation to get the flux ratio:
m − m_⊙ = −2.5 log10(F/F_⊙)  ⇒  F/F_⊙ = 10^{0.4(m_⊙ − m)}
F/F_⊙ = 10^[0.4(-26.74 − 7.24)] = 2.557e-14

Relate flux to temperature using Stefan–Boltzmann law.
Star:  L = 4πR^2σT^4  and  F = L/(4πd^2) = (R^2σT^4)/d^2.
Sun at Earth: F_⊙ = L_⊙/(4πAU^2).
Set F = F_⊙(F/F_⊙) and solve for T:
T = [ d^2 L_⊙ /(4πσR^2 AU^2) · 10^{0.4(m_⊙ − m)} ]^{1/4}
T = [ (3.318e+17)^2(3.850e+26)/(4π(5.670e-08)(2.287e+11)^2(1.496e+11)^2) · 2.557e-14 ]^(1/4)

312,"Two exoplanets, A and B, move in circular orbits around the same central star. The ascending nodes of both orbits coincide at the same ecliptic longitude, and both planets are initially located at that point.

The orbital inclinations are i₁ = 46.2° and i₂ = 76.5°, and the orbital periods are T₁ = 2.00 yr and T₂ = 1.00 yr.

Assuming uniform angular motion, how long will it take until the two planets again share the same ecliptic longitude?","Step 1: Geometry of the orbit
For a planet with orbital inclination i and angular velocity ω, the relation between its ecliptic longitude λ and time t is obtained from spherical geometry:

    tan λ = cos i · tan(ω t)

Step 2: Condition for equal ecliptic longitude
The planets share the same ecliptic longitude again when:

    cos i₁ · tan(ω₁ t) = cos i₂ · tan(ω₂ t)

Step 3: Use the ratio of angular velocities
Since ω = 2π / T, the angular velocities satisfy:

    ω₂ / ω₁ = T₁ / T₂ = 2.00

For the present case, this leads to an algebraic equation for tan(ω₁ t).
Following the standard textbook manipulation:

    tan(ω₁ t) = √(1 − 2 cos i₂ / cos i₁)

Step 4: Solve for the time
Thus,

    t = (T₁ / 2π) · arctan[ √(1 − 2 cos i₂ / cos i₁) ]

Inserting the numerical values gives:

    t ≈ 0.165 yr ≈ 60 days

Final Answer:
    t ≈ 0.165 yr (about 60 days)",t ≈ 0.165 yr (about 60 days),No,"{
  ""solution"": ""The two exoplanets start at the same ascending node, so we set the longitude of the ascending node Ω = 0 for both. For circular orbits, we set the argument of periapsis ω = 0 for simplicity. The true anomaly f increases uniformly with time: f = n t, where n is the mean motion. The ecliptic longitude λ is given by λ = atan2(cos(i) sin(f), cos(f)) for each planet.\n\nFor planet A: inclination i₁ = 46.2°, period T₁ = 2.00 yr, so n₁ = 2π/T₁ = π rad/yr, and f₁ = π t.\nFor planet B: inclination i₂ = 76.5°, period T₂ = 1.00 yr, so n₂ = 2π/T₂ = 2π rad/yr, and f₂ = 2π t.\n\nWe need t > 0 such that λ₁(t) = λ₂(t). For small t, both longitudes are in the first quadrant, so this implies tan(λ₁) = tan(λ₂), leading to cos(i₁) tan(f₁) = cos(i₂) tan(f₂). Substituting f₁ and f₂:\ncos(46.2°) tan(π t) = cos(76.5°) tan(2π t).\n\nUsing the double-angle formula tan(2π t) = 2 tan(π t) / [1 - tan²(π t)] and letting x = tan(π t), we get:\ncos(46.2°) x = cos(76.5°) * 2x / (1 - x²).\nFor x ≠ 0, divide by x: cos(46.2°) = 2 cos(76.5°) / (1 - x²).\nSolve for x²: x² = 1 - 2 cos(76.5°) / cos(46.2°).\n\nCompute cos(46.2°) ≈ 0.693920 and cos(76.5°) ≈ 0.233445.

Calculate log10(d_L / 10 pc) = log10(1.7 × 10^9 / 10) = log10(1.7 × 10^8) = log10(1.7) + 8 ≈ 0.2304 + 8 = 8.2304. Then, 5 × 8.2304 = 41.152, so 24 - M = 41.152, giving M ≈ -17.152. 2) Use the relation between absolute magnitude and luminosity: M - M_sun = -2.5 log10(L / L_sun), with M_sun = 4.74 for bolometric magnitude. Calculate M - M_sun = -17.152 - 4.74 = -21.892. Then, -21.892 = -2.5 log10(L / L_sun) → log10(L / L_sun) = 21.892 / 2.5 = 8.7568.

319,"David the astronomy enthusiast loves looking at stars! Specifically, he particularly enjoys looking at stars on the ecliptic. One day, he is out stargazing at midnight (local solar time) and looks at the antisolar point (the point on the celestial sphere exactly opposite to the Sun). He notices a faint glow of magnitude 11 $mag/arcsec^2$, and after some research he concludes that this is caused by a phenomenon known as $gegenschien$, where Solar System dust is lit up by the Sun and reflects some light back towards Earth. These particles are in an orbit of 1.81AU around the Sun. Assuming the radii of these particles are around 0cm and their albedo is 0.38, estimate the density of these particles. Express your answer in particles per square arcsecond.","'''
Step1: We can find the total luminosity from one square arcsecond of this source by using

$$
M-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
\quad\text{and}\quad
m-M=5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right).
$$

Combine these to eliminate $M$:

$$
2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)
= M_\odot + 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{r}{10\:\text{pc}}\right) - m
\implies
L=L_\odot\left(\frac{r}{10\:\mathrm{pc}}\right)^2\cdot 10^{(M_\odot-m)/2.5}.
$$

At the antisolar point (directly opposite the Sun), the dust is approximately $r=|R-1|$ AU from Earth, so

$$
r = |1.81-1|\ \text{AU} = 0.81\ \text{AU}
= \frac{0.81}{206265}\ \text{pc}.
$$

Get:

$$
L \approx 2.04\times 10^{11}\ \text{W}.
$$

Step2: Now, let's calculate how much luminosity one particle reflects. To do this, we calculate the solar flux at the dust orbit
and multiply by the particle's cross-sectional area and its albedo.

The solar flux at heliocentric distance $R$ is

$$
F = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}.
$$

A particle of radius $a$ has cross-section $A=\pi a^2$, so the reflected power (in this simplified model) is

$$
L_p = F\,A\,\alpha = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}\cdot (\pi a^2)\cdot \alpha.
$$

With $R=1.81\,\text{AU}$, $a=0\,\text{cm}$, and $\alpha=0.38$:

Get:

$$
L_p \approx 4.98\times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}.
$$

Step3: Finally, divide the total luminosity per arcsec$^2$ by the reflected luminosity per particle:

$$
N = \frac{L}{L_p}
\approx \frac{2.04\times 10^{11}}{4.98\times 10^{-4}}
= 4.1\times 10^{14}\ \text{particles/arcsec}^2.
$$

Note: one reasonable thing to do is to divide this number by two because the light emitted by these particles is not isotropic,
it is mostly scattered back towards the direction of the Earth. This and other reasonable assumptions should be accepted for full credit.

321,"Consider a satellite in a circular orbit of radius 9.59e+08 m around a planet. Due to a malfunction, the satellite’s orbital velocity is suddenly reduced to zero. The mass of the planet is 5.38e+24 kg. Neglect any gravitational influences other than that of the planet.

How long does the satellite take to hit the surface of the planet?","Step 1: Conceptual approach
The satellite initially moves in a circular orbit. When its velocity is reduced to zero, it begins to fall radially toward the planet. Because the initial orbital radius is much larger than the planet’s physical radius, the time to reach the surface is approximately the same as the time to reach the planet’s center.

This motion can be modeled as a degenerate elliptical orbit with:
  • Semi-major axis a = r / 2
  • The planet located at one focus

The satellite reaches the planet after half of the orbital period.

Step 2: Apply Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s Third Law for an orbit is:
    T² / a³ = 4π² / (GM)

Since the fall time t corresponds to half the orbital period:
    T = 2t

Substitute a = r / 2 and T = 2t:
    (2t)² / (r/2)³ = 4π² / (GM)

Solving for t:
    t = √(4π² r³ / (32GM))

Step 3: Numerical evaluation
    r = 9.59e+08 m
    G = 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²
    M = 5.38e+24 kg

  ""solution"": ""When the satellite's orbital velocity is reduced to zero, it begins to fall radially towards the planet under gravity. Using energy conservation, the total energy is E = -GMm/r, which corresponds to an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis a = r/2. The time to fall from the initial radius to the center (or approximately to the surface, since the planet's radius is much smaller than the orbital radius) is half the period of this elliptical orbit. The period T for an ellipse is T = 2π √(a³/(GM)), so the fall time t = T/2 = (π/(2√2)) √(r³/(GM)). Plugging in the values: G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², M = 5.38e24 kg, r = 9.59e8 m.

During what percentage of the time period of each orbit is the planet at least $0.687328902145742 r_{\text{min}}$ away from the star?","Step 1:
For an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$, the minimum and maximum distances from the focus are
$$r_{\text{min}} = a(1-e), \quad r_{\text{max}} = a(1+e).$$
Thus,
$$\frac{1+e}{1-e} = 4.164559619010866 \implies e = \frac{4.164559619010866-1}{4.164559619010866+1} = 0.613.$$

Step 2:
From $r_{\text{min}} = a(1-e)$, we obtain
$$a = \frac{1}{1-e} r_{\text{min}} = 2.582 \, r_{\text{min}}.$$
In the standard geometric construction of an ellipse, the semi-minor axis intersects the orbit at points that are a distance $a$ from the focus. This divides the orbit into regions of smaller and larger radial distance.

Step 3:
By Kepler’s second law, the fraction of time spent in a given part of the orbit is equal to the fraction of the total area swept out. Using the standard area decomposition (half the ellipse plus a triangular region), the proportion of the orbital period corresponding to this region is
$$\frac{e + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi}.$$

How long does the trip take in the reference frame of the light sail?","Step 1: Compute the sail speed in units of c.
Because 1 light-year per year equals the speed of light, we have:
v/c = (distance in ly) / (time in years)

v/c = 8.95 / 65.0 = 0.138

The Earth-frame time is dilated relative to the proper time on the sail:

v_p = 2πa / T

v_p = 2π(6.995e+09 m) / (2.844e+05 s) = 1.546e+05 m/s

M_s v_s = m_p v_p

0.0 = x^2 / 25 + (-2.3)

Solve for x^2:
x^2 / 25 = 0.0 - (-2.3) = 2.3
x^2 = 25 · (2.3) = 57.262

Thus, the mirror edge is at:
x = ±sqrt(57.262) = ±7.567 m

So the mirror diameter is:
D = 2|x| = 2(7.567) = 15.134 m

Step 2: Identify the focal length from the parabola coefficient.
A standard axial parabola with focal length f has the form:
y = x^2 / (4f) + c

Comparing with y = x^2 / 25 + c, we match:
1/25 = 1/(4f)  →  25 = 4f  →  f = 25/4 = 6.250 m

Step 3: Compute the focal ratio (f-number).
By definition,
f-number = f / D

f-number = 6.250 / 15.134 = 0.413

Therefore, the telescope has focal ratio f/0.413, i.e. f-number = f/0.413.",f/0.413,No,"{
  ""solution"": ""The primary mirror is parabolic with equation y = x^2/(25) - 2.3 (units in meters). The vertex is at y = -2.3 m. Comparing with the standard parabolic mirror equation y = x^2/(4f) relative to the vertex, we have 1/(4f) = 1/25, so focal length f = 25/4 = 6.25 m. The telescope tube intersects the mirror at y = 0, which gives the edge of the mirror. Setting y=0 yields 0 = x^2/25 - 2.3, so x^2 = 2.3 * 25 = 57.5, thus the aperture radius R = sqrt(57.5) m, and diameter D = 2R = 2 sqrt(57.5) m. The f-number (focal ratio) is f/D = 6.25 / (2 sqrt(57.5)) = 3.125 / sqrt(57.5). Numerically, sqrt(57.5) ≈ 7.583, so D ≈ 15.166 m, and f/D ≈ 0.412. Alternatively, using the sagitta s = 2.3 m and relation s = D^2/(16f), we get D^2 = 16f s = 16*6.25*2.3 = 230, so D = sqrt(230) m, and f/D = 6.25/sqrt(230) ≈ 0.412."",

What is the minimal possible ratio of the semi-major axis of planet A to that of planet B?","Step 1: To minimize the ratio of semi-major axes, the orbits must be at the limit of touching each other. If they were separated by a larger gap, the larger orbit could be shrunk further, reducing the ratio.

Because the major axes are aligned, there are two limiting configurations to consider.

Step 2: First configuration — the apoapsis of the smaller orbit touches the periapsis of the larger orbit.

Using the expressions for periapsis and apoapsis:
    r_peri = a(1 - e),   r_apo = a(1 + e)

This gives:
    a_A(1 - e_A) = a_B(1 + e_B)

Therefore:
    a_A / a_B = (1 + e_B) / (1 - e_A)
    = 2.164

Step 3: Second configuration — the apoapsis of the smaller orbit touches the apoapsis of the larger orbit.

This gives:
    a_A(1 + e_A) = a_B(1 + e_B)

Therefore:
    a_A / a_B = (1 + e_B) / (1 + e_A)

The distance between the two asteroids is 7.9 units. What is the ratio of the angular momentum of the whole system to the angular momentum of Do about the center of mass?","Step 1: Locate the center of mass.
The center of mass divides the separation inversely in the ratio of the masses.

Distance of Ek from the center of mass:
r_Ek = (m_Do / (m_Ek + m_Do)) × separation
     = (1.3 / (5.8 + 1.3)) × 7.9
     = 1.446

Distance of Do from the center of mass:
r_Do = (m_Ek / (m_Ek + m_Do)) × separation

     = 6.454

Step 2: Relate the orbital velocities.
Both asteroids have the same angular velocity about the center of mass.
Thus, orbital speed is proportional to distance from the center of mass.

Let the orbital speed of Ek be v.
Then the orbital speed of Do is:
v_Do = (r_Do / r_Ek) × v = 4.462v

Step 3: Write expressions for angular momentum.
Angular momentum of a particle in circular motion is given by L = m v r.

Total angular momentum of the system:
L_total = m_Ek·v·r_Ek + m_Do·v_Do·r_Do

If the cluster has physical radius R_C and is at distance d, its angular diameter is approximately

For a circular aperture, the Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolution:

If the Sun were the same size as it is today, but produced the same amount of power per unit volume as a human, what would its surface temperature be? Assume an average human produces 113 W of power and has a volume of 61266 cm$^3$.","Step 1: Compute the power per unit volume produced by a human.

The volume of the human must first be converted to cubic meters:

$$V = 61266 \times 10^{-6} = 6.1266e-02\,\mathrm{m^3}.$$

The power per unit volume is then

$$u = \frac{113}{6.1266e-02} = 1839\,\mathrm{W/m^3}.$$

Step 2: Compute the total power output of the Sun at this power density.

The volume of the Sun is $\frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3$, so the total power is

$$P = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_\odot^3 u.$$

Step 3: Relate the power output to the surface temperature using blackbody radiation.

The radiated power from the Sun’s surface is

$$P = 4\pi R_\odot^2 \sigma T^4.$$

Equating the two expressions for $P$ and solving for $T$ gives

$$T = \left(\frac{R_\odot u}{3\sigma}\right)^{1/4}.$$

Step 4: Insert numerical values.

$$T = \left(\frac{(6.96e+08)(1839)}{3(5.67e-08)}\right)^{1/4} = 52377\,\mathrm{K}.$$","$\boxed{T \approx 52377\,\mathrm{K}}$",No,"{

Delta-v (Δv) refers to the change in velocity during an orbital maneuver. What is the Δv required for this trans-Mars injection? The semimajor axes of the orbits of Earth and Mars are 1.469e+08 km and 2.297e+08 km, respectively.","Step 1: For a Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars, the transfer ellipse has semimajor axis
a_t = (a_E + a_M)/2
a_t = ( 1.469e+08 + 2.297e+08 )/2 = 1.883e+08 km

Step 2: The heliocentric speed on the transfer orbit at Earth's distance (vis-viva equation) is
v1 = sqrt( μ_sun (2/r_E − 1/a_t) )
v1 = sqrt( 1.327e+11 (2/1.469e+08 − 1/1.883e+08) ) = 33.189 km/s

Step 3: Earth's heliocentric orbital speed is
v_E = sqrt( μ_sun / r_E )
v_E = sqrt( 1.327e+11 / 1.469e+08 ) = 30.052 km/s

Therefore, the hyperbolic excess speed relative to Earth is
v_∞ = v1 − v_E
v_∞ = 33.189 − 30.052 = 3.136 km/s

Step 4: The spacecraft must depart Earth's gravity well from its LEO radius r_p = R_E + h.
The circular orbital speed is
v_orb = sqrt( μ_E / r_p )
r_p = 6371 + 390 = 6761 km
v_orb = sqrt( 3.986e+05 / 6761 ) = 7.679 km/s

The escape speed at the same radius is
v_esc = sqrt(2) v_orb
v_esc = sqrt(2)(7.679) = 10.859 km/s

Step 5: Relate hyperbolic excess speed to perigee speed on the departure hyperbola:
v_p^2 = v_esc^2 + v_∞^2
v_p = sqrt( (10.859)^2 + (3.136)^2 ) = 11.303 km/s

    Step 1: In the optical region, an effective wavelength of λ = 550 nm can be used. Let the aperture of the objective be D, its focal length be f, the magnification be ω, and the focal length of the eyepiece be f'.
    Using the relation between the telescope aperture D and the wavelength λ, first determine the aperture of the objective.

    D = 1.22 * λ / θ = 1.22 * 550 * 10^-9 / (1.2407434672775652 / 3600 * π / 180) = 11.2 cm.

    Step 2: The magnification ω of the visual telescope must be sufficient to magnify the angular separation of the observed object so that it can be resolved by the human eye (whose resolution is 1.932937679955057'').

Approximate the asteroid as a uniform sphere:
M = (4/3)πr^3 ρ
Diameter = 8.32 km = 8.323e+03 m, so r = 4.162e+03 m
ρ = 2.82 g/cm^3 = 2.819e+03 kg/m^3
M = (4/3)π(4.162e+03)^3(2.819e+03) = 8.511e+14 kg

Step 2: Find the speed needed to stay gravitationally bound near the surface.
Using the vis-viva equation for a circular orbit (a = r):
v^2 = μ(2/r − 1/a) with μ = GM  ⇒  for a = r:  v = sqrt(GM/r)
v = sqrt((6.67430e-11)(8.511e+14)/(4.162e+03)) = 3.695 m/s

Circumference = 2πr, and T = (hours)×3600 s:
T = 1.21×3600 = 4.372e+03 s
v' = 2πr/T = 2π(4.162e+03)/(4.372e+03) = 5.982 m/s

Step 4: Compare speeds.
If the required walking speed exceeds the near-surface orbital speed, the astronaut

373,A comet with an orbital period shorter than 250 years is defined as a short-period comet. Its perihelion distance is 0.874 AU. Find the possible maximum distance of its aphelion.,"Step 1: To get the maximum possible aphelion distance, take the largest allowed period.
So set the comet period T = 250 years, and perihelion distance q = 0.874 AU.

Using Kepler’s third law relative to Earth:
  (a / a_Earth)^3 = (T / T_Earth)^2.
With a_Earth = 1 AU and T_Earth = 1 year, this becomes:
  a^3 = T^2  =>  a = T^(2/3).

Thus the semi-major axis is:
  a = (250)^(2/3) AU ≈ 39.685 AU.

Step 2: For an elliptical orbit, perihelion q and aphelion Q satisfy:
  q + Q = 2a.
So the aphelion distance is:
  Q = 2a − q = 2×39.685 − 0.874 AU ≈ 78.496 AU.

Assume that the Earth maintains a perfectly circular orbit during this process.,"Step 1: Use Einstein’s mass–energy relation to relate luminosity and mass loss.
L_sun = -dE/dt = -(dM/dt)c^2  =>  dM/dt = -L_sun / c^2.

Substitute the constants:
dM/dt = -(3.83e+26) / (3.00e+08)^2 kg/s
     ≈ -4.26e+09 kg/s.

Step 2: For a circular orbit, v^2 = GM/r. If the orbit remains circular and angular momentum
is conserved (l = mrv = constant), then r ∝ 1/M.
Therefore:
dr/dt = - r (dM/dt) / M.

For a binary system with separation $a$ (in AU) and orbital period $p$ (in years), the total mass in solar units is given by

$$m_1 + m_2 = \frac{a^3}{p^2}.$$

Convert the orbital period from days to years:

$$p = \frac{8.5}{365.2422} = 0.0233\,\mathrm{yr}.$$

Substitute the given values:

$$m_1 + m_2 = \frac{(0.42)^3}{(0.0233)^2} = 136.89\,m_\odot.$$

Step 2: Use the given mass ratio to solve for individual masses.

Given $m_1 = 1.7 m_2$, we write:

$$1.7 m_2 + m_2 = 136.89 m_\odot.$$

Solving for $m_2$:

$$m_2 = \frac{136.89}{1 + 1.7} = 50.12\,m_\odot.$$

minimum is the secondary eclipse depth.

Step 2: Using the luminosity formula L = 4πR^2σT^4 and same radius for both stars,
the luminosity ratios are:
L_A / L_total = T_A^4 / (T_A^4 + T_B^4)
L_B / L_total = T_B^4 / (T_A^4 + T_B^4)

During primary eclipse, the hotter star (T_B = 13062 K) is eclipsed, so only the cooler star (T_A = 6504 K) is visible, giving flux F_primary ∝ T_A^4. During secondary eclipse, the cooler star is eclipsed, so only the hotter star is visible, giving flux F_secondary ∝ T_B^4.

If quantum effects are considered, black holes emit Hawking radiation. Assume that this radiation consists of photons with a blackbody spectrum that peaks at a wavelength $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\mathrm{SC}}$.

It is known that the Schwarzschild radius of a solar-mass black hole is $R_{\mathrm{SC,\odot}} = 2.952\,\mathrm{km}$.

1) Derive an expression for the black hole temperature $T_\mathrm{bh}$ in terms of its mass $M_\mathrm{bh}$ and physical constants.
2) Calculate $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ and $T_\mathrm{bh}$ for a black hole of mass 19.7061 $M_\odot$.","Solution:

Step 1: Use Wien’s displacement law.
The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is related to temperature by
\[
\lambda_{\rm peak} = \frac{b}{T}, \qquad b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m\,K}.
\]
Given $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, the temperature is
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b}{16 R_{\rm SC}}.
\]

Step 2: Express the Schwarzschild radius in terms of mass.
For a black hole,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = \frac{2 G M_{\rm bh}}{c^2}.
\]
Substituting into the temperature expression gives
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{2(16) G M_{\rm bh}}.
\]
For $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, this becomes
\[
\boxed{T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{32 G M_{\rm bh}}}.
\]

Step 3: Compute the Schwarzschild radius for the given mass.
Since $R_{\rm SC}$ scales linearly with mass,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = (2.952\,\mathrm{km}) \times (19.7061) = 58.172\,\mathrm{km}.
\]

Step 4: Compute the black hole temperature.
Convert the radius to meters:
\[
R_{\rm SC} = 5.817e+04\,\mathrm{m}.

Estimate the diameter of a telescope needed to obtain a spectrum of the same quality with the same instrument and exposure time for this star at its normal apparent brightness.","Step 1: Determine the microlensing magnification.
Let F be the unmagnified flux of the star. During microlensing, the flux is increased by a factor A. The relation between magnitude and flux is:

    m1 − m2 = −2.5 log10(F1 / F2)

Applying this to the unlensed and lensed magnitudes:

    I − I' = −2.5 log10(F / (A F)) = 2.5 log10 A

Thus:

    A = 10^((19.8 − 16.4) / 2.5) ≈ 23

Step 2: Relate flux collection to telescope diameter.
The number of photons collected per unit time is proportional to the collecting area, and hence to the square of the mirror diameter. Let D be the required telescope diameter.

To collect the same number of photons from the unlensed star as the reference telescope does from the lensed star:

    F D^2 = A F D_ref^2

Final Answer: A telescope with a diameter of approximately 48 m is required.",48 m,No,"{
  ""solution"": ""To achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the spectrum with the same instrument and exposure time, the number of photons collected must be equal. The number of photons is proportional to the flux of the star and the telescope's light-collecting area (proportional to the square of the diameter). The normal apparent magnitude is I = 19.8 mag, and the microlensed magnitude is I' = 16.4 mag, giving a magnitude difference ΔI = 19.8 - 16.4 = 3.4 mag. The flux ratio is calculated using the magnitude formula: F_mic / F_norm = 10^{0.4 * ΔI} = 10^{0.4 * 3.4} = 10^{1.36} ≈ 22.91. Thus, the flux during microlensing is about 22.91 times higher than the normal flux. For equal photon counts, the area ratio must compensate: A_new / A_vlt = F_mic / F_norm ≈ 22.91, where A_vlt is the area of the VLT (diameter 10.0 m). Since area is proportional to diameter squared, (D_new / 10.0)^2 ≈ 22.91, so D_new ≈ 10.0 * √22.91 ≈ 10.0 * 4.786 ≈ 47.86 m."",

The masses of the moon and the primary asteroid are m = 7.69e+09 kg and M = 7.29e+11 kg, respectively. The spacecraft’s impact speed relative to the moon was 6.32 km/s.

Assuming the collision is central and perfectly inelastic, and neglecting external gravitational influences, calculate the expected change in the orbital period of the moon (in minutes).","Step 1: Determine the initial orbital radius and velocity.
Because the primary asteroid is much more massive than the moon, we treat the moon as orbiting a fixed central mass. From Kepler’s third law:

    a^3 / P^2 = GM / (4π^2)

Solving for a gives a = 1.431e+03 m. The corresponding orbital speed is:

    v0 = 2πa / P

which yields v0 = 1.844e-01 m/s.

Step 2: Apply conservation of linear momentum during the collision.
For a perfectly inelastic, head-on collision:

    m v0 − m_s v_s = (m + m_s) v'

Since m_s << m, this can be approximated as:

    v' ≈ v0 − (m_s / m) v_s

Using the vis-viva equation and expanding to first order, the fractional change in the semi-major axis is:

Let $A$ be the surface area of one side of the flat Earth. If the Sun makes an angle $\theta$ with the Earth's axis, the absorbed solar power is
$$P_{\rm in} = S_\odot A \cos\theta.$$

The Earth radiates as a blackbody from both sides, so the emitted power is
$$P_{\rm out} = 2 A \sigma T^4.$$

At equilibrium, $P_{\rm in} = P_{\rm out}$, giving
$$T(\theta) = \left( \frac{S_\odot \cos\theta}{2\sigma} \right)^{1/4}.$$

We seek the angle $\theta_1$ such that

In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability.

Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

424,"<image>JSTL-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, David is researching an Earth-like exoplanet near the constellation of Bootes, orbiting a star twice the mass of our Sun. On March 14, 2025, the planet was observed at 3 AU from its parent star. After some time, David observes it again and finds that it has already passed its farthest point from the star and is now at 4 AU. If the planet is known to have a period of 5 years and an eccentricity of 0.5, what is the shortest amount of time that could have passed since the first observation on March 14, 2025? Assume that David views the orbit face-on and that the exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points.","Step1: First, we need to find the planet’s semi-major axis through the Kepler’s third law.

Get:

$\frac{a^3}{T^2} = M$

$a = \sqrt[3]{MT^2} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 5^2} \approx 3.684 \text{ AU}$

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

Get: 

$r=\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos f}$

$\cos f=\frac{1}{e}\left(\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{r}-1\right)$

$f_{3}\text{ AU }=99^{\circ}5^{\prime}27^{\prime\prime}$

$f_{4}\text{ AU }=231^{\circ}47^{\prime}36^{\prime\prime}$

Step3: From the true anomaly, we must convert it to eccentric anomaly. Similar to before, the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ and the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between 180° and 360°.

Get:

$\cos E = \frac{e + \cos f}{1 + e \cos f}$

$E_{3 \text{ AU}} = 68^\circ 12^{\prime} 7.2^{\prime\prime}$

$E_{4 \text{ AU}} = 260^\circ 7^{\prime} 18.9^{\prime\prime}$

Step4: From the eccentric anomaly, we must convert it to mean anomaly. Similar to before, the mean anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between 0 and $\pi$ and the mean anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between π and 2π. (The calculation below is in radians)

Get:

$M = E - e \sin E$

$M_{3 \text{ AU}} = 0.7261 \text{ rad}$

$M_{4 \text{ AU}} = 5.0326 \text{ rad}$

Step5: From the mean anomaly, we can find the elapsed time since March 14, 2025.

Get:

$M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \times (t - t_0)$

$\Delta M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$

$\Delta t = \Delta M \times \frac{T}{2\pi} = (M_{4 \text{ AU}} - M_{3 \text{ AU}}) \times \frac{5 \text{ yrs}}{2\pi}$

$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$

425,"Consider a hypothetical solar sail that starts its trajectory just outside the surface of the Sun and aims to reach Jupiter's orbit. This is a square sail with a size length of $l=50$ m, a mass of $m=2.0$ kg, and a reflectivity of $\eta=85\%.$ The remaining $15\%$ of the photons are absorbed by the sail. In order to simplify the calculations, only take into account the gravity and radiation pressure from the Sun, and assume that the sail is initially stationary with respect to the Sun. Estimate how long it would take for this sail to reach Jupiter's orbit. Feel free to make reasonable approximations if needed, but be sure to state and justify any approximations you make.","Step1: The radiation pressure is a result of the momentum of the photons, which is given by the following expression:

$p=\frac{E}{c}$

Where $p$ corresponds to the momentum, $E$ is the energy of the photon, and $c$ is the speed of light.

Since the momentum is conserved after the collision of the photons with the sail, it is possible to write the following expression for the radiation pressure on the sail.

Get:

$P_r=(1+\eta)\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}$

Where $P_r$ is the radiation pressure and $F_{\odot}$ is the Solar flux. Note that the $1+\eta$ term comes from the fact that a fraction $\eta$ of the photons being reflected causes a momentum in the opposite direction to their motion before the collision with the sail.

Step2: In order to preserve the momentum, the sail needs to end up with $1+\eta$ times the initial momentum to account for the reflected photons.

Taking into account both the radiation pressure and the gravity, it is possible to find an expression for the acceleration $a$ as a function of the distance $r$ to the Sun.

Get:

$ma=(1+\eta)A\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$ma=(1+\eta)l^{2}\frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^{2}c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

$a=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{(1+\eta)l^{2}L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm}-GM_{\odot}\right)$

$k=\frac{(1+\eta)l^2L_{\odot}}{4\pi cm} - GM_{\odot}=\frac{(1+0.85)\cdot 50^2\cdot 3.827\cdot 10^{26}}{4\pi \cdot 2.998\cdot 10^8 \cdot 2.0}-6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\cdot 1.989\cdot 10^{30}=1.0\cdot 10^{20} m^3 s^{-2}$

Step3: Using the definition of acceleration and the chain rule

Get:

$a=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}t}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}=v\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}r}\rightarrow \frac{k}{r^2}\mathrm{d}r=v\mathrm{d}v$

Step4: Integrating to find the velocity of the sail.

Get:

$\int_{R_{\odot}}^{r}\frac{k}{u^2}\mathrm{d}u=\int_{0}^{v}v\mathrm{d}v$

$\frac{v^2}{2}=k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)$

$v=\sqrt{2k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)}$

Step5: Since the radius of Jupiter’s orbit is much larger than the the radius of the Sun, for most of the trajectory, the velocity of the sail is approximately the following:

$v\approx \sqrt{\frac{2k}{R_{\odot}}}=5.4\cdot 10^5\ \mathrm{m/s}$

This is because the term $\frac{1}{r}$ is negligible compared to $\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}$ for most of the trajectory. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the time to travel to Jupiter as follows.

Get: 

$\Delta t\approx\frac{a_{4}}{v}=\frac{5.2\cdot 1.496\cdot 10^{11}}{5.4\cdot 10^5}=1.4\cdot 10^6\ \mathrm{s}=16\ \mathrm{days}$

  ""solution"": ""The problem involves estimating the time for a solar sail to travel from just outside the Sun's surface to Jupiter's orbit, considering only solar gravity and radiation pressure. The sail has a square shape with side length l=50 m (area A=2500 m²), mass m=2.0 kg, and reflectivity η=85% (absorption 15%). The sail starts stationary at the Sun's surface (approximated as R_sun ≈ 7×10⁸ m) and aims for Jupiter's orbit (R_j ≈ 5.2 AU ≈ 7.78×10¹¹ m).\n\nKey steps:\n1. **Forces**: Solar gravity F_grav = -G M_sun m / r², and radiation pressure force F_rad. For partial reflection, F_rad = (η + 1) S A / c, where S = L_sun / (4π r²) is the solar flux. Thus, F_rad = (η + 1) L_sun A / (4π c r²).\n2. **Net force**: F_net = F_rad + F_grav (positive outward) = [ (η + 1) L_sun A / (4π c) - G M_sun m ] / r² = K / r², where K is a constant.\n3. **Calculate K**: Using constants G=6.6743×10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², M_sun=1.989×10³⁰ kg, L_sun=3.828×10²⁶ W, c=2.998×10⁸ m/s, η=0.85, A=2500 m², m=2.0 kg. Compute K ≈ 2.05×10²⁰ N m² (positive, so outward net force).\n4. **Equation of motion**: From Newton's second law, m dv/dt = K / r². Using v dv/dr = K/(m r²), integrate to get v² = (2K/m) (1/R_sun - 1/r). Define α = 2K/m ≈ 2.05×10²⁰ m³/s².\n5. **Time integral**: Time T = ∫_{R_sun}^{R_j} dr / v = ∫_{R_sun}^{R_j} dr / √[α (1/R_sun - 1/r)]. Substitute r = R_sun y to simplify: T = R_sun √(R_sun/α) ∫_{1}^{R_j/R_sun} √[y/(y-1)] dy. The integral I = ∫ √[y/(y-1)] dy from y=1 to y=R_j/R_sun ≈ 1111.43. Solve I exactly via t=√(y-1): I = [ t√(t²+1) + ln(t+√(t²+1)) ] from t=0 to t=√(R_j/R_sun -1). For large R_j/R_sun, I ≈ R_j/R_sun + ln2 + 0.5 ln(R_j/R_sun) ≈ 1115.63.\n6. **Compute T**: R_sun=7×10⁸ m, √(R_sun/α)=√(7×10⁸ / 2.05×10²⁰) ≈ 1.848×10⁻⁶ s/m. Thus, T = (7×10⁸) × (1.848×10⁻⁶) × 1115.63 ≈ 1.443×10⁶ seconds.\n7. **Approximation**: The terminal velocity v_term = √(α/R_sun) ≈ 5.411×10⁵ m/s. For most of the journey, v ≈ v_term, so T ≈ R_j / v_term ≈ 7.78×10¹¹ / 5.411×10⁵ ≈ 1.438×10⁶ seconds, confirming the result.\n8. **Convert to days**: 1.44×10⁶ seconds / 86400 ≈ 16.7 days.\n\nApproximations made: ignoring other forces (e.g., solar wind), assuming perfect orientation, using average solar constants, and treating the Sun's surface as a point for force calculations (justified since R_sun << R_j)."",

Suppose the cluster undergoes gravitational contraction, which stops when it reaches a state where the virial theorem holds. Find the new radius of the cluster as a function of its initial radius and compute its numerical value.","Step1: We first calculate the cluster's initial radius using the definition of solid angle for a sphere:

$\Omega = \frac{\pi R_i^2}{d^2}$

Get:

$R_i = 8.3 \times 10^{17} \text{ m} = 26.9 \text{ pc}$

Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$.

At the stellar surface (r = R), the star radiates as a blackbody at temperature T_s, so F(R) = σ T_s^4. Equating fluxes: σ T_s^4 = (R_A^2 / R^2) σ T_c^4.

In thermal equilibrium, the luminosity L = 4π R^2 σ T_s^4 is constant through the envelope. The heat flux q = -κ dT/dr, and L = 4π r^2 q. Thus, dT/dr = -L/(4π κ r^2). Integrating from r = R_B (core) to r = R (surface), with T(R_B) = T_c and T(R) = T_s, and using T_s ≪ T_c, we have T_c - T_s ≈ L/(4π κ) (1/R_B - 1/R).

435,"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

$V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})}+V_{\mathrm{s}}$

We shall evaluate if the “drag-only” model satisfactorily predicts the arrival times of these CMEs. To use this model an appropriate choice of $t_0$, and corresponding $R_0$ and $V_{0}$ needs to be made.

For CME-3, take the following two cases:

(C1) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D1-D2 .

(C2) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D3-D4.

Assume the velocity remains constant in each specific interval D1-D2 and D3-D4, but may differ between the two intervals. Using $t_{0},R_{0}$, and $V_{0}$, calculate the difference between the observed and the predicted radial distance, $\delta R_{\mathrm{D}}\equiv R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)-R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$ in units of R$_\odot$ at $t=58.05h$,  for each of the two cases.","Step1: Inserting, $R_{0}$, $t_{0}$, $V_{0}$, and $V_{s}$ in the given expression

A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem.

Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion.

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

And, assuming the cluster is spherical, its radius is: $R=\frac{D_A\cdot\Delta\theta}{2}=\frac{1500\times10^6\times206265\times1.496\times10^{11}\times10^{-2}}{2}=2.3143\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{m}$

443,"The structure of a white dwarf is sustained against gravitational collapse by the pressure of degenerate electrons, a phenomenon explained by quantum physics and related to the Pauli Exclusion Principle for electrons. The equation of state of a gas made of non-relativistic degenerate electrons is the following:

$P=\left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3}\frac{h^{2}}{5m_{e}}n_{e}^{5/3},$

where $n_e$ is the number of electrons per unit volume, which can be expressed in terms of the mass density $\rho$ using the dimensionless factor $\mu_e$, the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) per unit electron. Also consider that the central pressure can be described by this equation of state. In the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure and gravitational forces balance each other at any distance $r$ from the centre of the star. This condition can be expressed by:

$\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}r}=-\frac{GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2},$

where $M(r)$ is the mass contained in the sphere of radius $r$, and $\rho(r)$ is the mass density of the star at a radius $r.$ Assume that $m_p=m_n$, the density of a white dwarf is roughly uniform, and the following approximation is valid at the surface of the star:

$\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}r}\right|_{r=R}\approx-\frac{P_c}{R},$

where $P_{c}$ is the pressure at the center of the star, and $R$ the star radius.

The relationship between the mass $M$ and the radius $R$ of a white dwarf can be written in the form: $R = a \cdot M^b$

Find the exponent $b$ and determine the coefficient $a$ in terms of physical constants and $\mu_e$.","Step1: Simplifying the expression given in the problem statement: $\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}r} = -\frac{GM(r)\rho}{r^{2}}$

At $r = R$, it is possible use the approximation provided and the expression $\rho = 3M/(4\pi R^3)$: $-\frac{P_c}{R} = -\frac{GM\{3M/(4\pi R^3)\}}{R^2}$

Step2: Furthermore, electron density $n_e$ can be related to mass density as:

444,"Observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background favour a flat (Euclidean) geometry, in which the total mass density (i.e.  density of matter and equivalent mass density of all forms of energy) should be equal to the so-called critical density: $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}\:=\:\frac{3\:H_{0}^{2}}{8\:\pi\:G}$,

where $H_{0}$ is the present value of the Hubble constant. However, the total density of matter (luminous and dark) is estimated at $\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}\:\approx\:2.8\cdot10^{-27}\:\mathrm{kg}\:\mathrm{m}^{-3}\:.$

To resolve this discrepancy, the standard cosmological model assumes that the Universe is filled with a mysterious ‘dark energy’ of constant energy density $E_\Lambda.$ Determine the value of $E_\Lambda$ and calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy. Neglect the contribution of electromagnetic radiation.

Step2: In flat geometry we have: $\rho_{m, 0}+\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{c^{2}}=\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$

Hence $E_{\Lambda}$ is given by: $E_{\Lambda}=\left[\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}-\rho_{m, 0}\right] c^{2} \approx 5.756 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

The linear scale of the Universe, $a$, is related to the cosmological redshift: $a(z)=a_{0} /(1+z)$

Thus, the matter density, $\rho_{m}$, increases with redshift: $\rho_{m}(z)=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3}$

451,"In cosmology, large-scale cosmological dark-matter halo fields are biased tracers of the underlying Gaussian matter density $\delta_m$. Assume we have a sample $\delta_m$. We simulate a halo number density field by taking $n(\mathbf{x}) = \bar{n}\max(0,1+b\delta_m(\mathbf{x}))$, where bare number density $\bar{n}$ and bare bias $b$ are specified constants. What is the bias of the sampled halo field? Derive an equation to evaluate the bias which depends on the bare bias and the variance in each pixel.","Step1:
**Detailed Steps**.

The solution to this question involves some domain knowledge, parts of which were given in the problem's statement, some approximations sourced by the domain knowledge, and some mathematical calculations. The domain knowledge is very basic and should be known to anyone in the field. Approximations are intuitive and also, mostly, inspired by the domain knowledge. Following Polya, we can organize it as follows:

Step2:
**Understand the problem.**

The number density of halos $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:

$\begin{equation}N_h = \int_{V} n_h(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}.\end{equation}$


The overdensity is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{n_h(\mathbf{x})-\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}{\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}.\end{equation}$

Linear bias is defined in terms of Fourier-transformed quantities:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{k}) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k}).\end{equation}$

This is an approximation that holds on sufficiently large scales (small $k$). $\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$ and $\delta_h(\mathbf{k})$ are Gaussian random fields with zero mean and their variance depends only on the magnitude of the wave-vector $k=|\mathbf{k}|$:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{mm}(k)),\ \delta_h \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{hh}(k)).\end{equation}$

The quantity $P(k)$ is called the power spectrum and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{k})\delta(\mathbf{k'})\rangle = (2\pi)^3\delta^D(\mathbf{k+k'})P(k).\end{equation}$

It immediately follows that:

$\begin{equation}P_{hh}(k) = b^2P_{mm}(k).\end{equation}$

We are given the expression in real space. In real space, the quantity $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$ is also a Gaussian random field:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_m),\ \delta_h(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_h).\end{equation}$

Quantity $\xi$ is called a two-point (real-space) correlation function and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x'})\rangle = \xi(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|).\end{equation}$

This quantity is sufficiently small when $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|\gg1$. We are asked to find what is the expression for $b$ in the equation $\delta_h(k) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$, given the real-space expression for the number density $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of real-space sample of $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$.

Step3:
**Devise a plan.**

The key point to solve this problem should be that real-space correlation function for halos $\xi_h$ should also be equal to $b^2\xi_m$. We want to calculate that correlation function. It should be expressed in terms of $\langle n(\mathbf{x})\rangle$ and $\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})n_h(\mathbf{x'})\rangle$. We expect to be able to calculate these expectations since they are the expectations of functions of the Gaussian random variables. We are given the pixel variance $\sigma$. How does it connect to the other quantities we know? In principle, that's also the part of domain knowledge but it also can be deducted from the definitions already given. A discretized version of the correlation function is:

$\begin{equation}\xi_{ij} = \langle\delta_{\mathbf{x_i}}\delta_{\mathbf{x_j}}\rangle.\end{equation}$

When $i=j$, it becomes the pixel variance $\sigma$. \textit{Aside, we could have given instead of $\sigma$, the quantity $P_{mm}(k)$, that is a common description of a cosmological dark-matter field. In that case, from the definitions of $\xi(r)$ and $P_{mm}(k)$, we could have deduced that $\sigma = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{k}P_{mm}(k)$}. Then we pick the ensemble of all the pixels at given fixed large distance $r=|\mathbf{x_i}-\mathbf{x_j}|$. The key is to recognize that it is fully described by a correlated bivariate Gaussian distribution.

$\begin{equation}(\delta^m_{i},\delta^m_{j}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma) \end{equation}$

with a covariance

$\begin{equation}\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2 & \xi^m_r  \\ \xi^m_r & \sigma^2 \end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}$

In general, the integrals from the expectation values are cumbersome, but we should expect some simplifications from the fact that $\xi$ is small and we can Taylor-expand the pdf.

Step4:
**Carry out the plan.**

It's more convenient to define $\hat{\delta}_{i} = \delta^m_i/\sigma$ and $\hat{\xi} = \xi^m_r/\sigma^2$, and $\phi_2$ - a correlated bivariate Gaussian pdf - then

$\begin{equation}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2(1-\hat{\xi}^2)}[\hat{\delta}^2_{i}+\hat{\delta}^2_{j}-2\hat{\xi}\hat{\delta}_{i}\hat{\delta}_{j}]}}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\hat{\xi}^2}} \equiv \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}).\end{equation}$

We note that

$\begin{equation}\xi^{n}_r = \frac{\langle n_in_j\rangle}{\langle n \rangle^2}-1.\end{equation}$

The quantity $\langle n\rangle$ is the actual mean number density:

$\begin{equation}\bar{n}^{'} = \langle n \rangle = \langle n_i \rangle = \int n^{loc}(\delta_i,b,\bar{n}) \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}) d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j} = \int n^{loc}_i \phi_1(\hat{\delta_i})d\hat{\delta_i}.\end{equation}$

Here, $\phi_1$ - is a standard normal pdf. It is expected that it's not dependent on the correlation $\hat{\xi}$, but only on $b$ and $\sigma$, just as the marginal of 2D correlated Gaussian distribution is 1D Gaussian that's not dependent on the cross-correlation. To the linear order in $\hat{\xi}$,

$\begin{equation}\phi_2(x,y|\hat{\xi}) \approx \phi_1(x)\phi_1(y)(1+\hat{\xi}xy).\end{equation}$

So that the two-point function neatly factorizes:

$$\begin{aligned}&\langle n_{i}n_{j}\rangle=\int n^{loc}(\delta_{i},b,\bar{n})n^{loc}(\delta_{j},b,\bar{n})\phi_{2}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi})d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\approx\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})d\hat{\delta}_{j}+\hat{\xi}\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})\hat{\delta}_{j}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\equiv\langle n\rangle^{2}+\hat{\xi}\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^{2}.\end{aligned}$$


Substituting the results for $\langle n\rangle$ and $\langle n_in_j\rangle$ in  the equation for $\xi^n_r$, we can read off the bias:

$\begin{equation}b^{'2} = \frac{\xi^n_r}{\sigma^2\hat{\xi}} = \frac{\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^2}{\sigma^2\langle n\rangle^2}.\end{equation}$


All that is left is to calculate the expectations. One can evaluate for $b\geq0$


$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta_{i}})d\hat{\delta_{i}}=\int\bar{n}\max(0,1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\int_{-\frac{1}{b\sigma}}^{+\infty}(1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)+b\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

For $b<0$ it's, however, 

$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\bar{n}\int_{-\infty}^{+\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}}(1-|b|\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

So we conclude that the latter expression is valid for all $b$. Similarly, one can show that

$\begin{equation}\langle n\hat{\delta }\rangle = \bar{n}\int\max(0,1+b\sigma x)x\phi_1(x)dx = \bar{n}b\sigma \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\end{equation}$

where $\Phi_1(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x\phi_1(x)dx$ - normal cdf. Finally, one can get

$\begin{equation}\boxed{b^{'} = \frac{b \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}{\Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}}.\end{equation}$

Note: We also accept solutions as correct if they omit the $|~|$ around the bias, since halo bias is usually positive.

$\begin{equation}

In the CM frame, s = (2E1)^2 = 4(m1^2 + |p_i|^2) and similarly s = 4(m2^2 + |p_f|^2), so |p_i| = √(s-4m1^2)/2 and |p_f| = √(s-4m2^2)/2. Thus, |p_f|/|p_i| = √((s-4m2^2)/(s-4m1^2)). Substituting |M|^2 = λ^2 gives dσ/dΩ = (λ^2/(64π^2 s)) √((s-4m2^2)/(s-4m1^2)). This is accurate to O(λ^2) as it includes the leading order contribution."",

$\begin{align}
H & =\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{m}+kx_{i}^{2}\right)+g\frac{(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}}{2}.
\end{align}$

If the ground state is $|\Omega\rangle$ and the operator $\hat{\rho}$ is the vacuum density matrix partially traced over the $|w\rangle_{x_{2}}$ components (satisfying $\hat{x}_{2}|w\rangle_{x_{2}}=w|w\rangle_{x_{2}}$),
i.e.

$\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}\equiv\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw\left(|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}''|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle w|\right)\left(|\Omega\rangle\langle\Omega|\right)\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\right)
\end{equation}$

which is an operator acting on a reduced Hilbert space, compute 

$\begin{equation}
S\equiv-\mathrm{Tr}_{x_{1}}\left[\hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}\right]
\end{equation}$

which involves the trace over $x_{1}$ states.","Step1: Diagonalize the original Hamiltonian

\begin{align}
H & =(x_{1}\quad x_{2}\quad p_{1}\quad p_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k+g}{2} & -\frac{g}{2}\\
-\frac{g}{2} & \frac{k+g}{2}\\
 &  & \frac{1}{2m}\\
 &  &  & \frac{1}{2m}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
p_{1}\\
p_{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}

Step2: One easily finds

$\begin{equation}
x_{1}=\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x1}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
x_{2}=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x2}
\end{equation}$

Step3: diagonalizes the Hamiltonian such that in the $(y_{1},y_{2},q_{1}\equiv m\dot{y}_{1},q_{2}\equiv m\dot{y}_{2})$ basis, it is

\begin{align}
H & =(y_{1}\quad y_{2}\quad q_{1}\quad q_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k}{2} & 0\\
0 & \frac{k}{2}+g\\
 &  & \frac{1}{2m}\\
 &  &  & \frac{1}{2m}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
q_{1}\\
q_{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}

Step4: The ladder operators are

$\begin{equation}
a_{j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}y_{j}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}}q_{j}\right)
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\omega_{2}^{2}=\frac{k+2g}{m}
\end{equation}$

Step5: which allows one to rewrite the Hamiltonian as

$\begin{equation}
H=\sum_{j=1}^{2}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{j}\omega_{j}+\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{2}.
\end{equation}$

Step6: In this basis, we denote the ground state as

$\begin{equation}
a_{1}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=0=a_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}.
\end{equation}$

Step7: Hence we have found $|\Omega\rangle=|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}$. We know that the wave function in the $\vec{y}$ coordinates is the product of well known simple harmonic oscillator solutions:

$\begin{equation}
\langle y'_{1},y'_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{2}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]
\end{equation}$

where

$\begin{equation}
b_{n}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{n}}}
\end{equation}$

Step8: making this a convenient basis to work with. Note

\begin{align*}
\hat{y}_{1}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right) & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'\hat{y}_{1}|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'y_{1}'|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\int dx_{1}'dx_{2}'y_{1}'\left(\left|x_{1}'\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|x_{2}'\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\left(\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle x_{2}'|\right)\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step9: where we used the completeness of the basis, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:x1}) and (\ref{eq:x2}), and the usual delta function normalization of the position basis. This and a similar relation for $\hat{y}_{2}$ imply

$\begin{equation}
\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}=\left|\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}$

Step10: This means

$\begin{equation}
\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\right)=\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\rangle=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].
\end{equation}$

Step11: The partial trace is defined through the following contraction of $(2,2)$ tensor to a $(1,1)$ tensor: 

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw\left(|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}''|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle w|\right)\left(|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\right)\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\right)\\
 & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step12: Integrate over $w$, we find

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\exp\left[-\frac{m}{4}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[\frac{(\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}-\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}})^{2}(x_{1}'+x_{1}'')^{2}}{8\frac{1}{m}(\frac{1}{\omega_{1}}+\frac{1}{\omega_{2}})}\right]\\
 & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}2x_{1}'x_{1}''-m\left[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}\right]\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}\right].\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step13: Next, to identify the matrix, use

$\begin{equation}
\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}2x_{1}'x_{1}''-m\left[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}\right]\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}=-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left[\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)-2\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right]
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\gamma\equiv8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\equiv\frac{m\gamma}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
b=2\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}
\end{equation}$

Step14: to write

\begin{align}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}} \times \nonumber\\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\exp\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right).
\end{align}

Step15: Change basis to energy with a new effective frequency

$\begin{equation}
b_{3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{3}}}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}=\sum_{nv}|v\rangle\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle\langle n|
\end{equation}$

\begin{align}
\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\langle v|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\

\end{align}

Step16: where

$\begin{equation}
\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!b_{3}\sqrt{\pi}2^{n}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{3}^{2}}}H_{n}\left(\frac{x_{1}'}{b_{3}}\right)
\end{equation}$

are the well known oscillator wave functions and $b_{3}$ still has to be chosen. One can show by carrying out the integrals that the
matrix is diagonalized if 

\begin{align*}
b_{3} & =\frac{b}{\left(1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}\omega_{1}^{1/4}\omega_{2}^{1/4}}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step17: This gives $\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle=\lambda_{n}\delta_{vn}$ where

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}m_{11}\left(\frac{b^{2}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}}{1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}}}\right)^{n-1}\\

\end{align*}

Step18: where we used

\begin{align*}
m_{11} & =\frac{b^{3}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\sqrt{2\pi}}{\left(1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right)^{2}}\right)^{3/2}}\\

\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{b_{3}}{b}\right)^{2} & =\frac{1}{m\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{1}{4\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step19: Simplify:

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+4\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}\right)^{n}\\
 & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{n}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step20: Since we want to evaluate

$\begin{equation}
-\mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}\right]=-\partial_{n}\ln\mathrm{tr}\hat{\rho}^{n}|_{n=1}
\end{equation}$

Step21: we compute

\begin{align*}
\ln\mathrm{tr}\rho^{n} & =\ln\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}^{n}\right)\\
 & =\ln\left(\sum_{j}\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{j}\right]^{n}\right)\\

Step2: For the slow-roll inflation, the following must hold: 

$\begin{equation}

$\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+|\partial\phi|^{2}-|F|^{2}
\end{equation}$

where $\xi$ is a 2-component Weyl spinor while $\phi$ and $F$ are complex scalar fields. Suppose you want to make the following infinitesimal transformation a symmetry of this theory:

$\begin{equation}
\delta_{\eta}\xi_{\alpha}=i\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}^{\mu}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\partial_{\mu}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta_{\alpha}F
\end{equation}$

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\beta}} & = [i\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\beta\dot{\alpha}}^{\mu}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\partial_{\mu}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta_{\beta}F]^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}(\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\sigma_{\dot{\alpha}\beta}^{\mu*})^{*}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}+\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\beta}}\bar{F}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}\eta^{\alpha}\sigma_{\alpha\dot{\beta}}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}+\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\beta}}\bar{F}\numberthis

$\begin{equation}
\delta_{\eta}F=i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu\dot{\alpha}\alpha}\partial_{\mu}\xi_{\alpha}=i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi
\end{equation}$

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\bar{F} & = -i\sqrt{2}(\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi)^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}(\partial_{\mu}\xi)^{\dagger}(\bar{\sigma}^{\mu})^{\dagger}(\bar{\eta})^{\dagger}\\
 & = -i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta\numberthis
\end{align*}

along with $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ where $\eta$ is a spacetime-independent infinitesimal fermionic parameter inducing the transformation. Find the transformation rule $\delta_{\eta}\phi$ and $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ for the action associated with $\mathcal{L}$ to remain invariant.","Denoting the variation $\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}$ as $\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}$, we write 

\begin{align*}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & = i\delta_{\eta}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi-\delta_{\eta}\bar{F}F-\bar{F}\delta_{\eta}F\\

Integrating by parts, we find (denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms)

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\eta\sigma^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\bar{\phi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}[\sqrt{2}\sigma^{\beta}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\beta}\phi-\cancel{i\sqrt{2}\eta F}]\nonumber \\

\end{align}

Integrate by parts the first two terms to eliminate the the $\sigma$ matrices using the identity $\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\sigma^{\nu}+\bar{\sigma}^{\nu}\sigma^{\mu}=2g^{\mu\nu}$:

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\left(\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial^{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)\nonumber \\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi
\end{align}

again denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms, and we are using the standard notation $\eta\xi\equiv\eta^{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\equiv\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}$.

To make the remainder cancel, we solve

$\begin{equation}
\sqrt{2}\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi=0
\end{equation}$
