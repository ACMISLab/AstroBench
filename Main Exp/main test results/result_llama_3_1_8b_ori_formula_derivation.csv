2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"# Problem: Deriving the Virial Theorem

## Step 1: Define the Problem and the Relevant Concepts

The virial theorem is a fundamental concept in astrophysics and thermodynamics that relates the average kinetic energy of a system to its potential energy. We will derive the virial theorem using Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.

## Step 2: Define the Virial and the Potential Energy

The virial is defined as the sum of the inner product of the position vector and the resultant force of all forces acting on a molecule:

$$\sum r \cdot F$$

The potential energy of a molecule is given by the sum of the potential energies due to all forces acting on it:

$$U = \sum \frac{1}{2} F \cdot r$$

## Step 3: Apply Newton's Second Law

Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration:

$$F = m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$$

Substituting this expression for F into the virial equation, we get:

$$\sum r \cdot F = \sum r \cdot m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}$$

## Step 4: Simplify the Expression

Using the product rule for derivatives, we can rewrite the expression as:

$$\sum r \cdot F = \sum m \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2 \right)$$

## Step 5: Relate the Virial to the Potential Energy

The potential energy of a molecule is given by:

$$U = \sum \frac{1}{2} F \cdot r$$

Substituting the expression for F from Newton's second law, we get:

$$U = \sum \frac{1}{2} m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} \cdot r$$

## Step 6: Derive the Virial Theorem

Taking the time derivative of the potential energy, we get:

$$\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}$$

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this expression as:

$$\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum m \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2 \right)$$

Comparing this expression with the expression for the virial, we get:

$$\sum r \cdot F = 2 \frac{dU}{dt}$$

This is the virial theorem, which relates the average kinetic energy of a system to its potential energy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2 \frac{dU}{dt}}$",0.546

## Step 1: Define the Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy of the system is given by:

$$T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}^{2}$$

Prove that for a celestial body in elliptical motion, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are given by:

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$

where $\mu$ is the standard gravitational parameter, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $e$ is the eccentricity, $v_{A}$ is the velocity at aphelion, and $v_{P}$ is the velocity at perihelion.

## Step 1: Understand the Basic Orbital Elements
To derive the expressions for velocities at aphelion and perihelion, we need to understand the basic orbital elements. These elements include the semi-major axis ($a$), eccentricity ($e$), inclination ($i$), longitude of the ascending node ($\Omega$), argument of periapsis ($\omega$), and true anomaly ($\theta$).

## Step 2: Recall the Vis-Viva Equation
The vis-viva equation relates the velocity of a celestial body to its distance from the central body. It is given by:

At aphelion, the distance from the central body is given by:

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

Substitute this expression into the vis-viva equation:

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)$

Simplify the expression:

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2-a}{a(1+e)}\right)$

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{1-e}{a(1+e)}\right)$

$v_{A}^{2}=\frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right)$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

We are given a cylindrical planet with average density $\rho$ and radius $R$. A satellite is orbiting around this planet. We need to find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.

## Problem-Solving Process
To find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet, we need to consider the gravitational force acting on the satellite and the centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit.

### Step 1: Determine the Gravitational Force Acting on the Satellite
The gravitational force acting on the satellite is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$F_g = G \frac{Mm}{d^2}$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $d$ is the distance between the center of the planet and the satellite.

### Step 2: Express the Mass of the Planet in Terms of Density and Volume
The mass of the planet can be expressed as:

$$M = \rho V$$

where $\rho$ is the average density of the planet and $V$ is the volume of the planet.

For a cylindrical planet, the volume is given by:

$$V = \pi R^2 h$$

where $R$ is the radius of the planet and $h$ is the height of the planet (which is assumed to be very long).

Substituting the expression for volume into the equation for mass, we get:

$$M = \rho \pi R^2 h$$

### Step 3: Substitute the Expression for Mass into the Gravitational Force Equation
Substituting the expression for mass into the gravitational force equation, we get:

$$F_g = G \frac{\rho \pi R^2 h m}{d^2}$$

### Step 4: Determine the Centripetal Force Required to Keep the Satellite in Orbit
The centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit is given by:

$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{d}$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the satellite.

### Step 5: Equate the Gravitational Force and Centripetal Force
Since the satellite is in orbit, the gravitational force and centripetal force must be equal. Therefore, we can equate the two forces:

$$G \frac{\rho \pi R^2 h m}{d^2} = \frac{mv^2}{d}$$

### Step 6: Simplify the Equation
Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$v^2 = G \frac{\rho \pi R^2 h}{d}$$

### Step 7: Express the Velocity in Terms of Period
The velocity of the satellite can be expressed in terms of its period $P$ as:

$$v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}$$

Substituting this expression into the equation for velocity, we get:

$$\left(\frac{2\pi d}{P}\right)^2 = G \frac{\rho \pi R^2 h}{d}$$

### Step 8: Solve for Period
Solving for period $P$, we get:

$$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{G \rho \pi R^2 h}$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$P = \frac{2\pi d^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\sqrt{G \rho \pi R^2 h}}$$

## Final Answer
The expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet is:

$$P = \frac{2\pi d^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\sqrt{G \rho \pi R^2 h}}$$",0.637

## Step 1: Understand the Given Information
We are given two galaxies, A and B, both with a radius R. Galaxy A is a spiral galaxy with a rotational velocity v at a distance R from its center. Galaxy B is a spherical elliptical galaxy composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars with a radial velocity dispersion also equal to v.

## Step 2: Choose Relevant Formulas
For Galaxy A, we will use the formula for rotational velocity:

v = √(GM / r)

where:
- v is the rotational velocity
- G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
- M is the mass of the galaxy
- r is the distance from the center of the galaxy

For Galaxy B, we will use the formula for radial velocity dispersion:

σ = √(2GM / r)

where:
- σ is the radial velocity dispersion
- G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)
- M is the mass of the galaxy
- r is the distance from the center of the galaxy

## Step 3: Derive the Mass of Galaxy A
Using the rotational velocity formula for Galaxy A, we can rearrange the formula to solve for mass M:

M = (v^2 * r) / G

## Step 4: Derive the Mass of Galaxy B
Using the radial velocity dispersion formula for Galaxy B, we can rearrange the formula to solve for mass M:

M = (σ^2 * r) / (2G)

## Step 5: Calculate the Mass of Galaxy A
Given that v = v and r = R, we can substitute these values into the formula for Galaxy A:

M_A = (v^2 * R) / G

## Step 6: Calculate the Mass of Galaxy B
Given that σ = v and r = R, we can substitute these values into the formula for Galaxy B:

M_B = (v^2 * R) / (2G)

## Step 7: Compare the Masses of Galaxies A and B
We can see that both galaxies have the same mass, but the mass of Galaxy B is half that of Galaxy A.

## Step 8: Provide the Final Answer
The masses of both galaxies are equal, but Galaxy B's mass is half that of Galaxy A. We can express this as:

M_A = M_B = (v^2 * R) / G

However, Galaxy B's mass is actually half that of Galaxy A.

M_B = M_A / 2 = (v^2 * R) / (2G)

So, the mass of Galaxy A is twice the mass of Galaxy B.

```python
import math

def calculate_mass(v, R, G):
    # Calculate the mass of Galaxy A
    M_A = (v**2 * R) / G
    
    # Calculate the mass of Galaxy B

## Problem Statement

We are given two formulas related to the electron degeneracy pressure and the gravitational pressure of a white dwarf star. We need to derive the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants.

## Given Formulas

1. Electron degeneracy pressure:
$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

2. Gravitational pressure:
$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

## Step 1: Find the Relationship Between Electron Density and Total Mass

We know that the total mass of the star $M$ is composed of the mass of the nuclei and the mass of the electrons. The mass of the nuclei is given by $M_n = \frac{A}{A-Z}m_n$, where $m_n$ is the mass of a nucleus. The mass of the electrons is given by $M_e = \frac{Z}{A}M$, where $M$ is the total mass of the star.

The total number of nuclei in the star is given by $N = \frac{M_n}{m_n}$. The total number of electrons in the star is given by $N_e = \frac{M_e}{m_e} = \frac{Z}{A}\frac{M}{m_e}$.

The number density of electrons $n$ is given by $n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z}{A}\frac{M}{m_eV}$.

## Step 2: Express the Volume of the Star in Terms of Its Mass and Radius

We know that the gravitational pressure is balanced by the electron degeneracy pressure. Therefore, we can set $p_{grav} = pelectron$ and solve for $V$. We get:

$\frac{\Omega}{3V} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

Substituting the expression for $n$, we get:

$\frac{-\frac{3GM^2}{5R}}{3V} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}(\frac{Z}{A}\frac{M}{m_eV})^{5/3}$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$V = \frac{3GM^2}{5\hbar^2}(3\pi^2)^{-2/3}(\frac{m_e}{\hbar^2})^{5/3}(\frac{A}{Z})^{5/3}M^{5/3}$

## Step 3: Express the Density of the Star in Terms of Its Mass and Other Constants

The density of the star $\rho$ is given by $\rho = \frac{M}{V}$. Substituting the expression for $V$, we get:

$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{3GM^2}{5\hbar^2}(3\pi^2)^{-2/3}(\frac{m_e}{\hbar^2})^{5/3}(\frac{A}{Z})^{5/3}M^{5/3}}$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$\rho = \frac{5\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}}{3GM^2}(\frac{m_e}{\hbar^2})^{-5/3}(\frac{Z}{A})^{5/3}M^{2/3}$

## Final Answer

The density of the white dwarf star is given by:

$\rho = \frac{5\hbar^2(3\pi^2)^{2/3}}{3GM^2}(\frac{m_e}{\hbar^2})^{-5/3}(\frac{Z}{A})^{5/3}M^{2/3}$

The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

To find the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$, we will use the given formulas for the magnetic field of a perfect magnetic dipole and the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field.

### Step 1: Find the Magnetic Field of Dipole 1 at the Location of Dipole 2

The magnetic field of a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is given by:

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

$\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$

### Step 2: Find the Potential Energy of Dipole 2 in the Magnetic Field of Dipole 1

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is given by:

$U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$

We will substitute $\vec{m}_2$ for $\vec{m}$ and $\vec{B}_1$ for $\vec{B}$:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$

Substituting the expression for $\vec{B}_1$:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression for $U_{\text{int}}$

To simplify the expression for $U_{\text{int}}$, we will use the fact that the dot product of two vectors is a scalar. Let $\theta$ be the angle between $\vec{m}_1$ and $\vec{r}$. Then:

$\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1)}{r^3}$

Since $\vec{m}_2$ and $\vec{m}_1$ are both parallel to $\hat{r}$, we can write:

$\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r} = m_2 \cos\theta$

$\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r} = m_1 \cos\theta$

Substituting these expressions:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3m_2 m_1 \cos^2\theta - m_1 m_2}{r^3}$

$K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2}.$

According to:

$\frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}.$

Conclude: 

$E_{\text{Total}} = V + K = -\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} + \frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r} = -\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r}.$

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"## Problem Definition
To find the total energy and the orbital momentum of the electron orbiting a proton, we need to consider the Coulombic attraction between the two particles.

## Given Information

- Mass of the electron: $m_{e}$
- Mass of the proton: $m_{p} \gg m_{e}$ (incomparably greater)
- Radius of the orbit: $r$
- Electric charge: $e$
- Coulomb's constant: $k_{e}$ (not explicitly given, but can be assumed as $k_{e} = 8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2$)

## Step 1: Determine the Gravitational Potential Energy
Since the mass of the proton is incomparably greater than the mass of the electron, we can neglect the gravitational potential energy between the two particles. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy is zero.

## Step 2: Determine the Coulombic Potential Energy
The Coulombic potential energy between the electron and the proton can be calculated using the formula:

$$U_{C} = -\frac{k_{e}e^2}{r}$$

## Step 3: Determine the Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy of the electron can be calculated using the formula:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^2$$

However, we need to express the kinetic energy in terms of the radius $r$. We can use the fact that the centripetal force is provided by the Coulombic force:

$$\frac{m_{e}v^2}{r} = \frac{k_{e}e^2}{r^2}$$

Solving for $v^2$, we get:

$$v^2 = \frac{k_{e}e^2}{m_{e}r}$$

Substituting this expression into the kinetic energy formula, we get:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}\left(\frac{k_{e}e^2}{m_{e}r}\right) = \frac{k_{e}e^2}{2r}$$

## Step 4: Determine the Total Energy
The total energy of the electron is the sum of the Coulombic potential energy and the kinetic energy:

$$E = U_{C} + K = -\frac{k_{e}e^2}{r} + \frac{k_{e}e^2}{2r} = -\frac{k_{e}e^2}{2r}$$

## Step 5: Determine the Orbital Momentum
The orbital momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula:

$$L = m_{e}vr$$

However, we need to express the orbital momentum in terms of the radius $r$. We can use the fact that the centripetal force is provided by the Coulombic force:

$$\frac{m_{e}v^2}{r} = \frac{k_{e}e^2}{r^2}$$

Solving for $v$, we get:

$$v = \frac{k_{e}e^2}{m_{e}r}$$

Substituting this expression into the orbital momentum formula, we get:

$$L = m_{e}\left(\frac{k_{e}e^2}{m_{e}r}\right)r = k_{e}\frac{e^2}{r}$$

The final answer is:

- Total Energy: $E = -\frac{k_{e}e^2}{2r}$
- Orbital Momentum: $L = k_{e}\frac{e^2}{r}$",0.637

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"## Problem Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to consider the motion of the meteorite and the space station before and after the collision. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum to determine the required quantities.

## Step 1: Determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision.
Let's denote the speed of the meteorite just before the collision as $v_1$. We can use the conservation of energy to relate the speed of the meteorite to its initial potential energy.

## Step 2: Apply the conservation of energy to the meteorite.
The initial potential energy of the meteorite is given by:
$U_1 = -\frac{GMm_1}{R}$

The kinetic energy of the meteorite is given by:
$K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2$

Using the conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy:
$-\frac{GMm_1}{R} = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2$

Solving for $v_1$, we get:
$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$

## Step 3: Determine the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate.
After the collision, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of $R/2$. Let's denote the speed of the conglomerate at the minimum distance as $v_{min}$ and the speed at the maximum distance as $v_{max}$.

## Step 4: Apply the conservation of angular momentum to the conglomerate.
The angular momentum of the conglomerate is conserved, so we can equate the angular momentum at the minimum distance to the angular momentum at the maximum distance:
$L_{min} = L_{max}$

Using the definition of angular momentum, we get:
$m_1v_{min} + m_2v_{min} = m_1v_{max} + m_2v_{max}$

## Step 5: Apply the conservation of energy to the conglomerate.
The initial potential energy of the conglomerate is given by:
$U_{min} = -\frac{GM(m_1+m_2)}{R/2}$

The kinetic energy of the conglomerate is given by:
$K_{min} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_{min}^2$

Using the conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy:
$-\frac{2GM(m_1+m_2)}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_{min}^2$

Solving for $v_{min}$, we get:
$v_{min} = \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{R}}$

## Step 6: Determine the maximum speed of the conglomerate.
Using the conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy at the maximum distance:
$-\frac{2GM(m_1+m_2)}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_{max}^2$

Solving for $v_{max}$, we get:
$v_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{2GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_2}}$

## Step 7: Determine the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.
Using the conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy at the maximum distance:
$-\frac{2GM(m_1+m_2)}{R} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_{max}^2$

Solving for the maximum distance, we get:
$r_{max} = \frac{2GM}{v_{max}^2}$

## Step 8: Determine the condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey.
The condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey is that the mass of the conglomerate must be greater than the mass of the Earth. This is because the conglomerate must have a closed orbit that approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance of $R/2$.

The final answer is: 
The shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is an ellipse.
The speed of the meteorite just before the collision is $\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$.
The minimum speed of the conglomerate is $\sqrt{\frac{4GM}{R}}$.
The maximum speed of the conglomerate is $\sqrt{\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{2GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_2}}$.
The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is $\frac{2GM}{v_{max}^2}$.

The condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey is that the mass of the conglomerate must be greater than the mass of the Earth.",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to:

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"# Problem Definition

The task is to show that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe.

## Problem-Solving Process

### Step 1: Recall the definition of surface magnitude

The surface magnitude of a galaxy is defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has, usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

### Step 2: Recall the definition of apparent magnitude

The apparent magnitude of an object is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth. It is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the flux received from the object to a reference flux.

### Step 3: Derive the formula for surface magnitude

Let $m_{app}$ be the apparent magnitude of a galaxy, $S$ be its solid angle, and $d$ be its distance from Earth. We can write the surface magnitude as:

$$m_{surf} = m_{app} - 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{S}{S_0} \right)$$

where $S_0$ is the solid angle of the reference object (e.g., the Sun).

### Step 4: Express the solid angle in terms of distance and angular diameter

The solid angle of a galaxy is given by:

$$S = \pi \left( \frac{D}{d} \right)^2$$

where $D$ is the angular diameter of the galaxy.

### Step 5: Substitute the expression for solid angle into the formula for surface magnitude

Substituting the expression for $S$ into the formula for $m_{surf}$, we get:

$$m_{surf} = m_{app} - 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\pi \left( \frac{D}{d} \right)^2}{S_0} \right)$$

### Step 6: Simplify the expression

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$m_{surf} = m_{app} - 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\pi D^2}{S_0 d^2} \right)$$

### Step 7: Show that surface magnitude is independent of distance

We can rewrite the expression for $m_{surf}$ as:

$$m_{surf} = m_{app} - 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\pi D^2}{S_0} \right) + 5 \log_{10} d$$

However, the term $5 \log_{10} d$ is a constant for a given galaxy, since $D$ and $S_0$ are constants. Therefore, the surface magnitude is independent of distance.

17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"# Problem Solution

## Step 1: Understand the Law of Universal Gravitation
The law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

F = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r^2

where:
- F is the gravitational force between the two masses
- G is the gravitational constant
- m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects
- r is the distance between the centers of the two objects

## Step 2: Consider a Planetary System
Consider a planetary system consisting of a central massive body (e.g., a star) and a planet orbiting around it. The planet's motion is influenced by the gravitational force exerted by the central body.

## Step 3: Derive Kepler's First Law
To derive Kepler's first law, we need to consider the planet's motion in a plane. Let's assume the planet's position is given by the polar coordinates (r, θ), where r is the radial distance from the central body and θ is the angular position.

The planet's velocity is given by:

v = dr/dt

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as:

v = (dr/dθ) \* (dθ/dt)

Since the planet's motion is circular, we can write:

r = r0 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))

where r0 is the semi-major axis and e is the eccentricity.

Differentiating this with respect to θ, we get:

dr/dθ = -r0 \* e \* sin(θ)

Substituting this into the expression for velocity, we get:

v = -r0 \* e \* sin(θ) \* (dθ/dt)

The planet's acceleration is given by:

a = dv/dt

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as:

a = (dv/dθ) \* (dθ/dt)

Substituting the expression for velocity, we get:

a = -r0 \* e \* cos(θ) \* (dθ/dt)^2

The gravitational force exerted by the central body is given by:

F = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r^2

Substituting the expression for r, we get:

F = G \* (m1 \* m2) / (r0 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ)))^2

Equating this to the expression for acceleration, we get:

-r0 \* e \* cos(θ) \* (dθ/dt)^2 = G \* (m1 \* m2) / (r0 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ)))^2

Simplifying this, we get:

r0^2 \* e^2 \* cos^2(θ) \* (dθ/dt)^2 = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r0^2 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))^2

Dividing both sides by r0^2, we get:

e^2 \* cos^2(θ) \* (dθ/dt)^2 = G \* (m1 \* m2) / r0^4 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))^2

Simplifying this, we get:

(dθ/dt)^2 = G \* (m1 \* m2) / (r0^4 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))^2)

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

dθ/dt = ± sqrt(G \* (m1 \* m2) / (r0^4 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))^2))

This is the equation of motion for the planet. Integrating this with respect to time, we get:

θ = ∫ ± sqrt(G \* (m1 \* m2) / (r0^4 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))^2)) dt

This is Kepler's first law, which states that the planet's orbit is an ellipse with the central body at one of the foci.

## Step 4: Derive Kepler's Second Law
To derive Kepler's second law, we need to consider the planet's angular momentum. The angular momentum is given by:

L = r \* m \* v \* sin(θ)

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as:

L = (r \* m \* dr/dt) \* sin(θ)

Since the planet's motion is circular, we can write:

r = r0 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))

Differentiating this with respect to time, we get:

dr/dt = -r0 \* e \* sin(θ) \* (dθ/dt)

Substituting this into the expression for angular momentum, we get:

L = -r0^2 \* e \* sin^2(θ) \* (m \* dθ/dt)

The planet's angular momentum is conserved, so we can write:

dL/dt = 0

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as:

dL/dt = (dL/dθ) \* (dθ/dt)

Substituting the expression for angular momentum, we get:

dL/dt = (-2 \* r0^2 \* e \* sin^2(θ) \* (m \* dθ/dt) \* (dθ/dt))

Simplifying this, we get:

dL/dt = -2 \* r0^2 \* e \* sin^2(θ) \* m \* (dθ/dt)^2

Equating this to zero, we get:

-2 \* r0^2 \* e \* sin^2(θ) \* m \* (dθ/dt)^2 = 0

Simplifying this, we get:

(dθ/dt)^2 = 0

This implies that the planet's angular momentum is constant, which is Kepler's second law.

## Step 5: Derive Kepler's Third Law
To derive Kepler's third law, we need to consider the planet's orbital period. The orbital period is given by:

T = ∫ dt

Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as:

T = ∫ (dr/dt) dt

Substituting the expression for velocity, we get:

T = ∫ (dr/dθ) \* (dθ/dt) dt

Since the planet's motion is circular, we can write:

r = r0 \* (1 + e \* cos(θ))

Differentiating this with respect to time, we get:

dr/dt = -r0 \* e \* sin(θ) \* (dθ/dt)

Substituting this into the expression for orbital period, we get:

T = ∫ (-r0 \* e \* sin(θ) \* (dθ/dt)) dt

Simplifying this, we get:

T = -r0 \* e \* ∫ sin(θ) dθ

Evaluating the integral, we get:

T = -r0 \* e \* (-cos(θ))

Simplifying this, we get:

T = r0 \* e \* cos(θ)

The orbital period is related to the planet's semi-major axis by Kepler's third law:

T^2 = (4 \* π^2 / G \* (m1 \* m2)) \* r0^3

Substituting the expression for T, we get:

(r0 \* e \* cos(θ))^2 = (4 \* π^2 / G \* (m1 \* m2)) \* r0^3

Simplifying this, we get:

r0^3 = (G \* (m1 \* m2) / (4 \* π^2)) \* (e \* cos(θ))^2

This is Kepler's third law, which states that the planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

The final answer is: There is no single numerical answer to this problem, as it involves deriving a set of laws that describe the motion of planets in our solar system. However, the derived laws are:

1. Kepler's first law: The planet's orbit is an ellipse with the central body at one of the foci.
2. Kepler's second law: The planet's angular momentum is conserved.
3. Kepler's third law: The planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

These laws are fundamental to our understanding of the motion of planets in our solar system and have been extensively tested and confirmed by observations and experiments.",0.714

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"## Problem Solving Process

To solve this problem, we will first derive the expressions for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components using the given formulas. Then, we will use these expressions to find the rotational velocity as a function of the Galactic longitude, $l$. Finally, we will take the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to the distance, $R$, at the location of the Sun, $R_0$, to find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity.

### Case (I): Actual Observed Rotation Curve of the Galaxy

The line-of-sight velocity component is given by:

$$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$$

The transverse velocity component is given by:

$$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$$

We can use the first order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components:

$$V_{r} = AD\sin2l$$

$$V_{t} = AD\cos2l + BD$$

The rotational velocity, $V$, is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

$$V^2 = V_{r}^2 + V_{t}^2$$

Substituting the expressions for $V_r$ and $V_t$, we get:

$$V^2 = (AD\sin2l)^2 + (AD\cos2l + BD)^2$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$V^2 = A^2D^2\sin^22l + A^2D^2\cos^22l + 2ABD^2\cos2l + B^2D^2$$

Using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2x + \cos^2x = 1$, we can simplify the expression further:

$$V^2 = A^2D^2 + 2ABD^2\cos2l + B^2D^2$$

Now, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to the distance, $R$, at the location of the Sun, $R_0$. Since $D \ll R_0$, we can treat $D$ as a constant. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD} \cdot \frac{dD}{dR}$$

Since $D \ll R_0$, we can assume that $D$ is constant, and therefore, $\frac{dD}{dR} = 0$. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD}$$

Using the expression for $V^2$, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $D$:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2AD\cos2l + 2AB\cos2l$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2A\cos2l + 2B\cos2l$$

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2(A + B)\cos2l$$

### Case (II): Rotation Curve for a Hypothetical Scenario without Dark Matter

In this case, the mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre. Therefore, the angular velocity, $\Omega$, is given by:

$$\Omega = \frac{GM}{R^2}$$

where $M$ is the mass of the Galaxy, and $R$ is the distance from the centre of the Galaxy.

Since the Sun is at a distance $R_0$ from the centre of the Galaxy, the angular velocity of the Sun, $\Omega_0$, is given by:

$$\Omega_0 = \frac{GM}{R_0^2}$$

The difference in angular velocities, $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$, is given by:

$$(\Omega - \Omega_0) = \frac{GM}{R^2} - \frac{GM}{R_0^2}$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$(\Omega - \Omega_0) = GM \left( \frac{1}{R^2} - \frac{1}{R_0^2} \right)$$

Using the first order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, we can find the rotational velocity, $V$, as a function of the Galactic longitude, $l$:

$$V^2 = (AD\sin2l)^2 + (AD\cos2l + BD)^2$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$V^2 = A^2D^2\sin^22l + A^2D^2\cos^22l + 2ABD^2\cos2l + B^2D^2$$

Using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2x + \cos^2x = 1$, we can simplify the expression further:

$$V^2 = A^2D^2 + 2ABD^2\cos2l + B^2D^2$$

Now, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to the distance, $R$, at the location of the Sun, $R_0$. Since $D \ll R_0$, we can treat $D$ as a constant. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD} \cdot \frac{dD}{dR}$$

Since $D \ll R_0$, we can assume that $D$ is constant, and therefore, $\frac{dD}{dR} = 0$. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD}$$

Using the expression for $V^2$, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $D$:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2AD\cos2l + 2AB\cos2l$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2A\cos2l + 2B\cos2l$$

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = 2(A + B)\cos2l$$

However, in this case, we can simplify the expression further by using the fact that the mass of the Galaxy is concentrated at its centre. Therefore, the difference in angular velocities, $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$, is given by:

$$(\Omega - \Omega_0) = GM \left( \frac{1}{R^2} - \frac{1}{R_0^2} \right)$$

Substituting this expression into the equation for the line-of-sight velocity component, we get:

$$V_{r} = GM \left( \frac{1}{R^2} - \frac{1}{R_0^2} \right) R_0 \sin l$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$V_{r} = GM \left( \frac{R_0}{R^2} - \frac{R_0}{R_0^2} \right) \sin l$$

$$V_{r} = GM \left( \frac{1}{R^2} - \frac{1}{R_0} \right) \sin l$$

Now, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to the distance, $R$, at the location of the Sun, $R_0$. Since $D \ll R_0$, we can treat $D$ as a constant. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD} \cdot \frac{dD}{dR}$$

Since $D \ll R_0$, we can assume that $D$ is constant, and therefore, $\frac{dD}{dR} = 0$. Therefore, the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $R$ is given by:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV}{dD}$$

Using the expression for $V_r$, we can find the derivative of the rotational velocity with respect to $D$:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = -\frac{2GM}{R^3} \sin l$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{dV}{dD} = -\frac{2GM}{R_0^3} \sin l$$

## Final Answer

For the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = 2(A + B)\cos2l$$

For the rotation curve for a hypothetical scenario without dark matter:

$$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\frac{2GM}{R_0^3} \sin l$$",0.728

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem

We are given two equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components of an HI cloud in the Galaxy, as observed from the Sun. The problem is to express Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ in terms of the rotational velocity of the Sun $V_0$, the distance from the Sun to the Galactic Centre $R_0$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$.

## Step 2: Deriving the Line-of-Sight and Transverse Velocity Components

We start by using the given equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components:

$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$

$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

## Step 3: Applying the Small Angle Approximation

Since the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ is small, we can use the small angle approximation to expand the sine and cosine functions:

$\sin l \approx l$

$\cos l \approx 1$

Substituting these approximations into the equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, we get:

$V_{r} \approx (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} l$

$V_{t} \approx (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} - \Omega D$

## Step 4: Expressing the Angular Velocities in Terms of Rotational Velocities

We can express the angular velocities in terms of the rotational velocities using the following equations:

$\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$

$\Omega_{0} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$

Substituting these equations into the approximations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, we get:

$V_{r} \approx \frac{V}{R} R_{0} l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} R_{0} l$

$V_{t} \approx \frac{V}{R} R_{0} - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} R_{0} - \frac{V}{D} D$

## Step 5: Simplifying the Equations

Simplifying the equations, we get:

$V_{r} \approx (V - V_{0}) l$

$V_{t} \approx V - V_{0} - \frac{V}{D} D$

## Step 6: Expressing the Velocity Components in Terms of the Radial Gradient

We can express the velocity components in terms of the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ by using the following equation:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0}}$

Substituting this equation into the approximations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, we get:

$V_{r} \approx \frac{dV}{dR} R_{0} l$

$V_{t} \approx V - V_{0} - \frac{dV}{dR} R_{0}$

## Step 7: Deriving the Oort's Constants

We can derive the Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ by comparing the approximations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components with the given equations:

$V_{r} = AD \sin 2l$

$V_{t} = AD \cos 2l + BD$

Substituting the expressions for the velocity components in terms of the radial gradient, we get:

$\frac{dV}{dR} R_{0} l = AD \sin 2l$

$V - V_{0} - \frac{dV}{dR} R_{0} = AD \cos 2l + BD$

## Step 8: Solving for the Oort's Constants

Solving for the Oort's constants, we get:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}$

$B = -\frac{dV}{dR} R_{0}$

The final answer is: $\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}, B = -\frac{dV}{dR} R_{0}}$",0.728

- The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of a massive object of mass M is given by $U = -\frac{GMm}{r}$, where G is the gravitational constant.
- The total energy of an object in a circular orbit is given by $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the object.
- For a Keplerian orbit, the velocity of the object can be found using the formula $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$.

### Step 3: Derive the Expression for the Total Mechanical Energy per Unit Mass

- Let's consider the element of gas of mass $\Delta m$ at the maximum radius $R_{max}$ of the disc. The total energy of this element is given by $E_{max} = \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM\Delta m}{R_{max}}$, where $v_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_{max}}}$ is the velocity of the element at the maximum radius.
- Now, let's consider the element of gas of mass $\Delta m$ at a radius $r \ll R_{max}$. The total energy of this element is given by $E_{r} = \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_{r}^2 - \frac{GM\Delta m}{r}$, where $v_{r} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$ is the velocity of the element at the radius $r$.
- The change in energy of the element as it moves from the maximum radius to the radius $r$ is given by $\Delta E = E_{r} - E_{max}$.
- Since the process of accretion is very slow, we can assume that the kinetic energy of the element is converted into internal energy of the gas disc through viscous dissipation. Therefore, the change in energy of the element is given by $\Delta E = \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM\Delta m}{R_{max}} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta m v_{r}^2 + \frac{GM\Delta m}{r}$.

### Step 4: Simplify the Expression for the Total Mechanical Energy per Unit Mass

- Substituting the expressions for $v_{max}$ and $v_{r}$, we get $\Delta E = \frac{1}{2}\Delta m \left(\frac{GM}{R_{max}}\right) - \frac{GM\Delta m}{R_{max}} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta m \left(\frac{GM}{r}\right) + \frac{GM\Delta m}{r}$.
- Simplifying the expression, we get $\Delta E = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta m \left(\frac{GM}{R_{max}}\right) + \frac{GM\Delta m}{r}$.
- Dividing both sides by $\Delta m$, we get $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{GM}{R_{max}}\right) + \frac{GM}{r}$.

### Step 5: Simplify the Expression Further

- Since we are interested in the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $R_{max}$ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius $r \ll R_{max}$, we can neglect the term $-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{GM}{R_{max}}\right)$.
- Therefore, the final expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass is given by $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{r}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{GM}{r}}$",0.728

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to derive an expression for the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ in terms of distance $D$, speed of light $c$, and time $T$ using a thought experiment involving a mirror, laser beam, and the expansion of the universe.

## Step 2: Identify Relevant Information
The separation between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, following the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation. We also know that the laser beam travels to the mirror, reflects off it, and returns to the Earth after a time $T$.

## Step 3: Analyze the Laser Beam's Journey
The laser beam travels a distance of $2D$ to reach the mirror, as the mirror is placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System. The time taken for the laser beam to travel to the mirror is $t_1 = \frac{2D}{c}$, and the time taken for the laser beam to travel back to the Earth is $t_2 = \frac{2D}{c}$.

## Step 4: Calculate the Total Time
The total time $T$ is the sum of $t_1$ and $t_2$, which is $T = 2t_1 = 2t_2 = \frac{4D}{c}$.

## Step 5: Use the Expansion Law
We know that the separation between the Solar System and the mirror increases due to the expansion of the universe, following the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$. Since the laser beam travels a distance $2D$ to reach the mirror, we can set up the equation $2D = se^{H_{0}t}$.

## Step 6: Substitute $t = T/2$
Since the laser beam travels to the mirror and back, the time taken for the expansion of the universe is half of the total time, which is $t = T/2$. Substituting this into the equation $2D = se^{H_{0}t}$, we get $2D = se^{H_{0}(T/2)}$.

## Step 7: Simplify the Equation
Using the approximation $e^x \approx 1 + x$ for $x \ll 1$, we can simplify the equation $2D = se^{H_{0}(T/2)}$ to $2D = s(1 + \frac{H_{0}T}{2})$.

## Step 8: Rearrange the Equation
Rearranging the equation $2D = s(1 + \frac{H_{0}T}{2})$, we get $2D = s + \frac{H_{0}sT}{2}$.

## Step 9: Solve for $H_{0}$
Subtracting $s$ from both sides of the equation $2D = s + \frac{H_{0}sT}{2}$, we get $2D - s = \frac{H_{0}sT}{2}$. Then, solving for $H_{0}$, we get $H_{0} = \frac{2(2D - s)}{sT}$.

## Step 10: Simplify the Expression
Simplifying the expression $H_{0} = \frac{2(2D - s)}{sT}$, we get $H_{0} = \frac{4D - 2s}{sT}$.

## Step 11: Express $H_{0}$ in Terms of $D$ and $T$
Since we want to express $H_{0}$ in terms of $D$ and $T$, we can substitute $s = D$ into the expression $H_{0} = \frac{4D - 2s}{sT}$. This gives us $H_{0} = \frac{4D - 2D}{DT} = \frac{2D}{DT} = \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{D}{c}$.

## Step 12: Express $H_{0}$ in Terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$
However, we need to express $H_{0}$ in terms of $D$, $c$, and $T$, without any additional constants. We can simplify the expression $H_{0} = \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{D}{c}$ to $H_{0} = \frac{2D}{Tc}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2D}{Tc}}$",0.728

## Step 1: Identify the given information
We are given the following information:
- The dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$.
- The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$.
- $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power.

## Step 2: Determine the power of c and R
Since $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power, let's denote this power as $n$. Then, we can express $L_{GW}$ as:

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G \frac{M^a c^b}{R^c}$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are unknown exponents.

## Step 3: Apply dimensional analysis
We need to determine the exponents $a$, $b$, and $c$ by applying dimensional analysis. The dimensions of each quantity are:
- $L_{GW}$: $E/t = ML^2/t^3$
- $G$: $L^3/(MT^2)$
- $M$: $M$
- $c$: $L/T$
- $R$: $L$

## Step 4: Set up the dimensional equations
We can set up the following dimensional equations:

$$\frac{ML^2}{t^3} = \frac{L^3}{MT^2} \frac{M^a c^b}{R^c}$$

$$\frac{ML^2}{t^3} = \frac{L^3}{MT^2} \frac{M^a (L/T)^b}{L^c}$$

## Step 5: Simplify the dimensional equations
We can simplify the dimensional equations by canceling out the common factors:

$$\frac{ML^2}{t^3} = \frac{L^3}{MT^2} \frac{M^a L^{b-c}}{T^b}$$

## Step 6: Equate the exponents
We can equate the exponents of each dimension:

- For $M$: $1 = a$
- For $L$: $2 = 3 + b - c$
- For $t$: $-3 = -2 - b$

## Step 7: Solve the system of equations
We can solve the system of equations:

- From the first equation, we have $a = 1$.
- From the third equation, we have $b = -1$.
- Substituting $a = 1$ and $b = -1$ into the second equation, we get $2 = 3 - 1 - c$, which gives $c = 0$.

## Step 8: Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the expression for L_GW
We can substitute the values of $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 0$ into the expression for $L_{GW}$:

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G \frac{M^1 c^{-1}}{R^0}$$

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G \frac{M}{c}$$

## Step 9: Simplify the expression for L_GW
We can simplify the expression for $L_{GW}$:

$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{GM}{c}$$
