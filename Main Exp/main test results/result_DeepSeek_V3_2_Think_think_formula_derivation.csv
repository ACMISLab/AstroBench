2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

## **Problem-Solving Process**

We consider a system of \( N \) particles (molecules, stars, or galaxies) with the following definitions for particle \( i \):

- Mass: \( m_i \)
- Position vector relative to a fixed origin: \( \mathbf{r}_i \)
- Resultant force on particle \( i \): \( \mathbf{F}_i \)
- Velocity: \( \mathbf{v}_i = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \)
- Acceleration: \( \mathbf{a}_i = \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i \)

The **virial** \( G \) is defined as:

\[
G = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

We want to relate \( G \) to kinetic and potential energy via **Newton’s second law**:

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}
\]

---

### **Step 1: Start from a related quantity**

Consider instead the time derivative of \( \sum_i m_i (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = \sum_i m_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i \right)
\]

But \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{v}_i \), so:

\[
= \sum_i m_i \left( \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i \right)
\]

Recognize:

\[
m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i = 2 \times \frac12 m_i v_i^2 = 2 \, T_i
\]
where \( T_i \) is the kinetic energy of particle \( i \).

Thus:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = 2 \sum_i T_i + \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i
\]

---

### **Step 2: Apply Newton’s second law**

Since \( \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i \), we have \( m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \).

But from the definition of the virial:

\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i
\]

Therefore:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = 2T + G
\]
where \( T = \sum_i T_i \) is the total kinetic energy.

---

### **Step 3: Consider time average for a bounded system**

If the system is in a **steady state** (statistically stationary over long times), the time average of \( \frac{d}{dt} Q \) tends to zero for bounded \( Q \).  
Here \( Q = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \) is bounded for a system confined to a finite region of space with finite velocities.

Take time average over a long interval \( \tau \):

\[
\left\langle \frac{dQ}{dt} \right\rangle = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \frac{dQ}{dt} \, dt = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{Q(\tau) - Q(0)}{\tau} = 0
\]
if \( Q \) is bounded.

Thus:

\[
\langle 2T + G \rangle = 0
\]

So:

\[
2\langle T \rangle + \langle G \rangle = 0
\]

or

\[
\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle G \rangle
\]

This is the **virial theorem** in its general mechanical form.

---

### **Step 4: Relate \( G \) to potential energy for conservative forces**

If forces are **conservative** and **central**, and come from an interaction potential \( U(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N) \) that is a homogeneous function of coordinates of degree \( k \) (meaning \( U(\lambda \mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \lambda \mathbf{r}_N) = \lambda^k U(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N) \)), then **Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions** gives:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U
\]

But \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), so

\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -k U
\]

Here \( U \) is the total potential energy of the system.

Thus:

\[
2\langle T \rangle + \langle G \rangle = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2\langle T \rangle - k \langle U \rangle = 0
\]

So:

\[
2\langle T \rangle = k \langle U \rangle
\]

---

### **Step 5: Special case – Newtonian gravity**

For Newtonian gravitational forces, the potential energy \( U \) is homogeneous of degree \( k = -1 \) because \( U \propto 1/r \).

Therefore:

\[
2\langle T \rangle = -1 \cdot \langle U \rangle
\]

\[
2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
\]

Or:

\[
\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle
\]

and total energy:

\[
E = \langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = -\langle T \rangle
\]

---

## **Final Derived Formula of the Virial Theorem (mechanical form)**

\[
\boxed{ 2\langle T \rangle + \langle G \rangle = 0 }
\]

For conservative forces with a homogeneous potential of degree \( k \):

\[
\boxed{ 2\langle T \rangle = k \langle U \rangle }
\]

For gravitational systems (\( k = -1 \)):

\[
\boxed{ 2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0 }
\]

### **Application to galaxy mass determination**

In astronomy, for a galaxy in equilibrium, we observe the stellar velocity dispersion \( \sigma \) (related to \( \langle T \rangle \)) and estimate the gravitational potential energy \( U \) from the spatial distribution of light (assuming mass follows light). Using \( M \sim \frac{R \sigma^2}{G} \) (from scaling of \( T \sim M\sigma^2 \), \( U \sim -GM^2/R \)), we can estimate the galaxy's mass. This avoids needing to track orbits of all stars individually.",0.546

m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N.
\]

From these equations, we derive the following first integrals (constants of motion).

---

### 1. Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

Define the total linear momentum as:

\[
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Differentiating with respect to time:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
\]

The double sum can be rearranged into pairs \(i < j\):

\[
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j > i} \left[ -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right].
\]

Since \(|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|\) and \((\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\), the two terms cancel for each pair:

\[
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = 0.
\]

Thus, \(\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0\), and \(\mathbf{P}\) is constant. This yields **3 first integrals** (the components of \(\mathbf{P}\)).

---

### 2. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum

Define the total angular momentum about the origin as:

\[
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Differentiating:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Substituting the equation of motion:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right) = -G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Since \(\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\), we have:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j).
\]

Again, pairing \(i < j\):

\[
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j > i} \left[ \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i) \right].
\]

Using \(\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j\), the terms cancel:

\[
\frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) - \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) = 0.
\]

Thus, \(\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0\), and \(\mathbf{L}\) is constant. This yields **3 first integrals** (the components of \(\mathbf{L}\)).

---

### 3. Conservation of Total Energy

Define the kinetic energy \(T\) and potential energy \(U\) as:

\[
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2, \quad U = -G \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
\]

The total energy is \(E = T + U\). Differentiating:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt}.
\]

Compute each term:

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
\]

Using the equation of motion, \(m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\nabla_i U\), where \(\nabla_i\) is the gradient with respect to \(\mathbf{r}_i\). Indeed, one can verify that:

\[
\nabla_i U = G \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
\]

so that \(m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\nabla_i U\). Thus,

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (-\nabla_i U) = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \nabla_i U.
\]

On the other hand,

\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
\]

Adding:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \nabla_i U + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0.
\]

Therefore, \(E\) is constant, yielding **1 first integral**.

---

### Summary

The first integrals of motion for the \(N\)-body system are:
- **Total linear momentum** \(\mathbf{P}\) (3 constants),
- **Total angular momentum** \(\mathbf{L}\) (3 constants),
- **Total energy** \(E\) (1 constant).

These arise from the invariance of the equations under translations, rotations, and time translations, respectively. Additionally, conservation of linear momentum implies uniform motion of the center of mass, providing 3 further constants (e.g., initial center of mass position), but these are obtained by integrating \(\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0\).",0.714

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

The standard results are:

\[
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}},
\]

where \(\mu = G(M + m)\) (with \(M\) the central mass and \(m\) the orbiting mass, often approximated as \(\mu \approx GM\) when \(M \gg m\)), \(a\) is the semi-major axis, and \(e\) is the eccentricity.

### Proof

**Step 1: Determine the distances at aphelion and perihelion.**  
For an elliptical orbit, the radial distance \(r\) as a function of the true anomaly \(\theta\) is given by:

\[
r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}.
\]

- At **aphelion**, \(\theta = \pi\), \(\cos\pi = -1\):
  \[
  r_A = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1+e).
  \]
- At **perihelion**, \(\theta = 0\), \(\cos 0 = 1\):
  \[
  r_P = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e} = a(1-e).
  \]

**Step 2: Apply the vis-viva equation.**  
The vis-viva equation relates the speed \(v\) of an orbiting body to its current distance \(r\) and orbital parameters:

\[
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right).
\]

- For **aphelion**, substitute \(r = r_A = a(1+e)\):
  \[
  v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1+e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1+e} - 1 \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1+e)}{1+e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1-e}{1+e} \right).
  \]
  Taking the square root yields:
  \[
  v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}.
  \]

- For **perihelion**, substitute \(r = r_P = a(1-e)\):
  \[
  v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1-e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1-e} - 1 \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1-e)}{1-e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1+e}{1-e} \right).
  \]
  Taking the square root yields:
  \[
  v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}.
  \]

### Conclusion
We have derived the required expressions directly from the vis-viva equation and the known apsidal distances for an ellipse. These formulas confirm that the velocity is smallest at aphelion and largest at perihelion, consistent with Kepler’s second law and conservation of energy.",0.546
10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"The period \(P\) of a satellite orbiting a very long cylindrical planet depends on whether the orbit is inside or outside the planet. Assuming the satellite orbits outside the planet (\(d > R\)), the relationship is derived using Gauss's law for gravity and circular motion.

### Derivation

1. **Gravitational Acceleration via Gauss's Law**:  
   For an infinite cylinder of radius \(R\) and uniform density \(\rho\), the gravitational acceleration at a distance \(d\) from the axis (for \(d > R\)) is given by:
   \[
   g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d},
   \]
   where \(G\) is the gravitational constant.

2. **Circular Orbit Condition**:  
   For a satellite in a circular orbit of radius \(d\) with period \(P\), the centripetal acceleration is:
   \[
   a_c = \frac{v^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}.
   \]
   Setting \(a_c = g\) yields:
   \[
   \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Solving for \(P\)**:  
   Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}.
   \]
   Thus, the period is:
   \[
   P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}.
   \]

### Additional Consideration

If the satellite orbits inside the planet (\(d < R\)), the gravitational acceleration is \(g = 2\pi G \rho d\), leading to a period independent of \(d\):
\[
P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}.
\]

However, for a typical satellite orbiting outside, the expression for \(d > R\) applies.

### Final Answer

For a satellite orbiting outside a very long cylindrical planet of radius \(R\) and average density \(\rho\), the period \(P\) at distance \(d\) from the center is:
\[
\boxed{P = \dfrac{d}{R} \sqrt{\dfrac{2\pi}{G\rho}}}.

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"### Solution

We are given two galaxies, A and B, both of radius \(R\). Galaxy A is a spiral galaxy with rotational velocity \(v\) at distance \(R\) from its center. Galaxy B is a spherical elliptical galaxy with a uniform density of stars and a radial velocity dispersion equal to \(v\). We calculate their masses using basic dynamical principles.

---

### Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)

For a spiral galaxy, the mass can be estimated from the circular orbital speed at radius \(R\), assuming spherical symmetry and that most of the mass lies within \(R\). The centripetal acceleration of a test mass orbiting at radius \(R\) is provided by gravity:

\[
\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M_A}{R^2},
\]

where \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Solving for the mass \(M_A\):

\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}.
\]

This result holds regardless of whether the mass distribution is point-like or uniform, as long as the total mass inside \(R\) is \(M_A\).

---

### Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)

Galaxy B is modeled as a uniform sphere of radius \(R\) with constant density \(\rho\). Its mass is \(M_B = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho\). The galaxy is supported by random motions, characterized by a one-dimensional velocity dispersion \(v\) (given as the radial velocity dispersion). Assuming an isotropic velocity distribution, the total kinetic energy \(K\) is related to the velocity dispersion by

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle,
\]

where \(\langle v^2 \rangle\) is the mass-weighted mean square speed. For isotropy, \(\langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2\).

The gravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere is

\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}.
\]

Applying the virial theorem for a system in equilibrium, \(2K + U = 0\):

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0.
\]

Substituting \(\langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2\):

\[
M_B \cdot 3v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}.
\]

Solving for \(M_B\):

\[
3v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}.
\]

---

### Final Masses

\[
\boxed{M_A = \dfrac{v^2 R}{G}} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{M_B = \dfrac{5 v^2 R}{G}}.
\]

Thus, under the given assumptions, Galaxy B is five times more massive than Galaxy A for the same \(v\) and \(R\).",0.637

---

### **Step 1: Equilibrium Condition**
The electron degeneracy pressure \( p_{\text{electron}} \) balances the gravitational pressure \( p_{\text{grav}} \):
\[
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: Electron Degeneracy Pressure**
Given:
\[
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3},
\]
where \( n \) is the electron number density.

---

### **Step 3: Relating \( n \) to Mass Density \( \rho \)**
For nuclei with atomic number \( Z \) and mass number \( A \), each nucleus contributes \( Z \) electrons and has mass approximately \( A m_u \), where \( m_u \) is the atomic mass unit. The mass density is:
\[
\rho = n_{\text{nuclei}} \cdot (A m_u),
\]
and the electron number density is:
\[
n = Z \cdot n_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u}.
\]

---

### **Step 4: Gravitational Pressure**
The gravitational pressure is:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R},
\]
where \( M \) is the total mass, \( R \) is the radius, and \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \). Substituting:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}.
\]

Express \( R \) in terms of \( \rho \):
\[
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}.
\]
Thus:
\[
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3} = \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} G M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

---

### **Step 5: Substitute into Equilibrium Condition**
Set \( p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}} \):
\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} G M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}.
\]

Divide both sides by \( \rho^{4/3} \):
\[
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{1}{m_u} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3} = \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} G M^{2/3}.
\]

---

### **Step 6: Solve for \( \rho \)**
Isolate \( \rho^{1/3} \):
\[
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} G M^{2/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{1}{m_u} \right)^{5/3} } = \frac{ m_e m_u^{5/3} }{ \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} G M^{2/3} \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^{5/3}.
\]

Cube both sides to get \( \rho \):
\[
\rho = \frac{ m_e^3 m_u^5 }{ \hbar^6 (3\pi^2)^2 } \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right) G^3 M^2 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5.
\]

Simplify the constants:
\[
(3\pi^2)^2 = 9\pi^4, \quad \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{4\pi}{3}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\rho = \frac{ m_e^3 m_u^5 }{ \hbar^6 \cdot 9\pi^4 } \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3} \cdot G^3 M^2 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \frac{G^3 M^2 m_e^3 m_u^5}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5.
\]

---

### **Final Result**
The mass density of the white dwarf in equilibrium is:
\[
\boxed{\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \frac{G^3 M^2 m_e^3 m_u^5}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5}.
\]

This expression shows that the density scales with the square of the mass and the fifth power of the ratio \( A/Z \), consistent with the non-relativistic treatment of electron degeneracy pressure.",0.637

The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$.

Using Gaussian units where the Coulomb force is \(e^2/r^2\) and potential energy is \(-e^2/r\), the centripetal force balance yields:

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"In a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance because the decrease in flux with distance is exactly compensated by the decrease in solid angle subtended by the galaxy. This can be shown as follows:

### Step 1: Define Surface Brightness
Surface brightness \(I\) is defined as the flux per unit solid angle:
\[
I = \frac{F}{\Omega},
\]
where \(F\) is the total flux received from the galaxy and \(\Omega\) is the solid angle it subtends on the sky.

### Step 2: Express Flux and Solid Angle in Terms of Distance
For a galaxy at distance \(d\) with total luminosity \(L\) and physical area \(A\) (perpendicular to the line of sight), the flux is given by the inverse-square law:
\[
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}.
\]
Assuming small angles, the solid angle is approximately:
\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute Surface Brightness
Substitute the expressions for \(F\) and \(\Omega\) into the definition of \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{L/(4\pi d^2)}{A/d^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi A}.
\]
This shows that \(I\) depends only on the intrinsic properties of the galaxy (\(L\) and \(A\)) and not on the distance \(d\).

### Step 4: Relate Surface Magnitude to Surface Brightness
Surface magnitude \(\mu\) is defined on a logarithmic scale:
\[
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(I) + \text{constant},
\]
where the constant is chosen based on the unit system (e.g., mag/arcsec\(^2\)). Since \(I\) is independent of \(d\), \(\mu\) is also independent of \(d\).

### Conclusion
In a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude (or surface brightness) of a galaxy remains constant regardless of its distance because both the flux and the solid angle scale as \(1/d^2\), causing the dependence on distance to cancel out.",0.735

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane.

We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

**Kepler’s Laws:**
1. **First Law:** The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.
2. **Second Law:** A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3. **Third Law:** The square of the orbital period \(T\) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \(a\) of its orbit, i.e., \(T^2 \propto a^3\).

**Assumptions:**
- The Sun of mass \(M\) is fixed at the origin (valid approximation since \(M \gg m\), where \(m\) is the planet’s mass).
- Gravitational force is the only force acting, and it follows Newton’s law of universal gravitation: \(\mathbf{F} = -G \frac{M m}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}\), where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(r\) is the distance, and \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) is the unit vector from the Sun to the planet.

**Step 1: Equation of Motion**
From Newton’s second law, \(\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}\), and canceling \(m\):
\[
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \tag{1}
\]
where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the position vector of the planet.

**Step 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum and Kepler’s Second Law**
The gravitational force is central (radial), so torque \(\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = 0\). Thus, angular momentum \(\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times m \mathbf{v}\) is conserved. Define \(\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}\), so \(\mathbf{L} = m \mathbf{h}\) with constant magnitude \(h = |\mathbf{h}|\).

In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\):
\[
\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}, \quad \mathbf{v} = \dot{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\]
\[
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times (\dot{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = r^2 \dot{\theta} \hat{\mathbf{k}} \implies h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant} \tag{2}
\]

The area swept out per time \(dA/dt\) is given by:
\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta \implies \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2} h = \text{constant}
\]
Thus, equal areas are swept in equal times, which is **Kepler’s second law**.

**Step 3: Deriving the Orbit Equation (Kepler’s First Law)**
Using the radial component of acceleration in polar coordinates:
\[
\mathbf{a} = (\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) \hat{\mathbf{r}} + (r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}) \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\]
From (1), the tangential component is zero, and the radial equation is:
\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \tag{3}
\]
Substitute \(\dot{\theta} = h/r^2\) from (2):
\[
r \dot{\theta}^2 = \frac{h^2}{r^3}
\]
So (3) becomes:
\[
\ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \tag{4}
\]
To solve, change variables to \(u = 1/r\), and express derivatives with respect to \(\theta\). Using (2):
\[
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \frac{h}{r^2} = -h \frac{du}{d\theta} \quad \text{(since } dr/d\theta = -r^2 du/d\theta \text{)}
\]
\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt} \dot{r} = -h \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{du}{d\theta} \right) = -h \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} \dot{\theta} = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2}
\]
Substitute into (4) with \(r = 1/u\):
\[
-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2
\]
Divide by \(-h^2 u^2\):
\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2} \tag{5}
\]
This is a linear differential equation. The general solution is:
\[
u(\theta) = A \cos(\theta - \theta_0) + \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]
Choose \(\theta_0 = 0\) for simplicity:
\[
u(\theta) = A \cos \theta + \frac{GM}{h^2} \implies r = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{A \cos \theta + \frac{GM}{h^2}}
\]
Let \(p = \frac{h^2}{GM}\) and \(e = \frac{A h^2}{GM}\). Then:
\[
r = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta} \tag{6}
\]
This is the equation of a conic section in polar coordinates with eccentricity \(e\). For bounded orbits (planets), \(0 \leq e < 1\), which represents an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. This is **Kepler’s first law**.

**Step 4: Deriving Kepler’s Third Law**
For an ellipse, from (6), the semi-major axis \(a\) and semi-latus rectum \(p\) are related by \(p = a(1 - e^2)\). The perihelion and aphelion distances are:
\[
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{p}{1+e}, \quad r_{\text{max}} = \frac{p}{1-e} \implies a = \frac{1}{2}(r_{\text{min}} + r_{\text{max}}) = \frac{p}{1-e^2}
\]
From Kepler’s second law, the area swept per period \(T\) is the total area of the ellipse:
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} h \implies A = \frac{1}{2} h T
\]
The area of an ellipse is \(A = \pi a b\), where \(b = a \sqrt{1-e^2}\) is the semi-minor axis. Thus:
\[
\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2} = \frac{1}{2} h T \implies T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{h} \tag{7}
\]
From \(p = h^2/(GM)\) and \(p = a(1-e^2)\), we have:
\[
h = \sqrt{GM p} = \sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)}
\]
Substitute into (7):
\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{\sqrt{GM a (1-e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
\]
Square both sides:
\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \tag{8}
\]
Thus, \(T^2 \propto a^3\), with proportionality constant \(4\pi^2/(GM)\), which is **Kepler’s third law**.

**Summary:**
- **Second Law:** Derived directly from conservation of angular momentum due to the central force.
- **First Law:** Derived by solving the equation of motion to show the orbit is an ellipse.
- **Third Law:** Derived by combining the area law with geometric properties of the ellipse and conservation laws.

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"The radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the solar location, \(\frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0}\), is derived for two cases: the actual observed rotation curve (Case I) and a Keplerian rotation curve with mass concentrated at the center (Case II). The expressions are obtained using Oort's constants and dynamical considerations.

### Derivation for Case I: Actual Observed Rotation Curve
For any rotation curve, the rotational velocity \(V\) and angular velocity \(\Omega\) are related by \(V = R\Omega\). Differentiating:
\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = \Omega + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}.
\]
At \(R = R_0\), this becomes:
\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}. \tag{1}
\]

Oort's constant \(A\) is defined as:
\[
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}, \quad \text{so} \quad \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{2A}{R_0}. \tag{2}
\]
From the relation between Oort's constants, \(\Omega_0 = A - B\). Substituting into (1) along with (2):
\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = (A - B) + R_0 \left(-\frac{2A}{R_0}\right) = A - B - 2A = -(A + B).
\]
Thus, for the actual observed rotation curve:
\[
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)}.
\]

### Derivation for Case II: Keplerian Rotation Curve (Mass Concentrated at Center)
Assuming all mass \(M\) is at the Galactic center, the rotation curve is Keplerian:
\[
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
\]
Differentiating with respect to \(R\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{GM} \, R^{-1/2} \right) = \sqrt{GM} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sqrt{GM}}{R^{3/2}}.
\]
Since \(V = \sqrt{GM/R}\), we have \(\sqrt{GM} = V R^{1/2}\), so:
\[
\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V R^{1/2}}{R^{3/2}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V}{R}.
\]
Evaluating at \(R = R_0\) with \(V_0 = V(R_0)\):
\[
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}}.
\]
This can also be expressed as \(-\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0\) since \(\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0\).

### Summary
- **Case I (observed):** \(\displaystyle \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)\)
- **Case II (point mass):** \(\displaystyle \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}\)

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude:

\]

where \(\Omega = V/R\) and \(\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0\). For small \(D \ll R_0\), the distance from the Galactic center to the cloud is approximated as \(R \approx R_0 - D \cos l\). Expanding \(\Omega(R)\) to first order:

\[
\Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = \Omega_0 - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l.
\]

Substituting into \(V_r\):

\[
V_r \approx -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin l \cos l = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l.

Comparing with \(V_r = A D \sin 2l\) yields:

\[
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}.
\]

Using \(V = \Omega R\), differentiate to relate \(d\Omega/dR\) to \(dV/dR\):

\[
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right).

Substituting into \(A\):

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right).

\[
V_t \approx -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D.

\[
V_t \approx A D \cos 2l + A D - \Omega_0 D = A D \cos 2l + (A - \Omega_0) D.
\]

Comparing with \(V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D\) gives:

\[
B = A - \Omega_0.
\]

Expressing \(\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0\) and substituting the expression for \(A\):

\[
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right).

Let ${t}_{1}$ be the time taken by the light beam from the Solar System to the mirror, let ${t}_{2}$ be the time taken by the beam from the mirror to the Solar System and $T$ the total time to go back and forth. As a first order approximation,we will take distance travelled by the photon in each part as an average of the initial and final distance. Therefore, equating the kinematics of the situation, we have:

${S}_{1} = \frac{D + D{e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{1}}}{2} = \frac{D\left( {1 + {e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{1}}}\right) }{2} = c{t}_{1}$

${S}_{2} = \frac{{S}_{1} + {S}_{1}{e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{2}}}{2} = \frac{{S}_{1}\left( {1 + {e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{2}}}\right) }{2} = c{t}_{2}= \frac{D}{4}\left( {1 + {e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{1}}}\right) \left( {1 + {e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{2}}}\right)\approx  \frac{D}{4}\left( {2 + {H}_{0}{t}_{1}}\right) \left( {2 + {H}_{0}{t}_{2}}\right)\approx  \frac{D}{4}\left\lbrack  {4 + 2{H}_{0}\left( {{t}_{1} + {t}_{2}}\right) }\right\rbrack$

Conclude: 

${S}_{2} = D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)$

According to: 

From the first equation, we also find: ${S}_{1} = c{t}_{1} = \frac{D\left( {1 + {e}^{{H}_{0}{t}_{1}}}\right) }{2}$

$c{t}_{1} = D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}{t}_{1}}\right)$

Conclude: 

${t}_{1} = \frac{D}{c - \frac{1}{2}D{H}_{0}}$

${S}_{1} = c{t}_{1} = \frac{2Dc}{{2c} - D{H}_{0}}$

similarly, ${S}_{2} = \frac{2{S}_{1}c}{{2c} - {S}_{1}{H}_{0}}$

According to: 

Joining the expressions found, we obtain: ${S}_{2} = D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{2{S}_{1}c}{{2c} - {S}_{1}{H}_{0}}$

$D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{\frac{{4D}{c}^{2}}{{2c} - D{H}_{0}}}{{2c} - \frac{2Dc}{{2c} - D{H}_{0}} \cdot  {H}_{0}}$

$\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{2c}{{2c} - D{H}_{0} - D{H}_{0}} = \frac{c}{c - D{H}_{0}}$

$c = \left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right) \left( {c - D{H}_{0}}\right)= c - D{H}_{0} + \frac{1}{2}c{H}_{0}T - \frac{1}{2}D{H}_{0}^{2}T$

$0 = \frac{{H}_{0}}{2}\left( {{cT} - {2D} - D{H}_{0}T}\right)$

Conclude: 

${H}_{0} = \frac{{cT} - {2D}}{DT}$",No,"The Hubble constant \(H_0\) is determined by considering the round-trip time \(T\) for light to travel from Earth to a mirror at initial proper distance \(D\) and back in an expanding universe with scale factor \(a(t) = e^{H_0 t}\). The total comoving distance traveled by light is \(2D\), leading to the equation:
\[
\int_0^T \frac{c}{a(t)} \, dt = 2D.
\]
Substituting \(a(t) = e^{H_0 t}\) and integrating gives:
\[
\frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 T}\right) = 2D,
\]
or equivalently:
\[
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2H_0 D}{c}.
\]
For small \(H_0 T\), the approximation \(e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{1}{2}(H_0 T)^2\) is used. Substituting this into the equation yields:
\[
H_0 T - \frac{1}{2}(H_0 T)^2 = \frac{2H_0 D}{c}.
\]
Canceling \(H_0\) (assuming \(H_0 \neq 0\)) and solving for \(H_0\) gives:
\[
H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right).
\]
This expression is valid when \(H_0 T \ll 1\), i.e., when the expansion over time \(T\) is small.

26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"The gravitational wave luminosity \(L_{\text{GW}}\) for a binary system of two identical neutron stars of mass \(M\) each orbiting at a radius \(R\) from the center of mass is derived using dimensional analysis and the given dimensionless constant \(\frac{2}{5}\).

**Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the quantities involved.**  
- Luminosity \([L_{\text{GW}}] = \text{power} = \text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-3}\)  
- Gravitational constant \([G] = \text{M}^{-1} \text{L}^3 \text{T}^{-2}\)  
- Speed of light \([c] = \text{L} \text{T}^{-1}\)  
- Mass \([M] = \text{M}\)  
- Orbital radius \([R] = \text{L}\)

**Step 2: Assume a power-law form.**  
Let \(L_{\text{GW}} = k \, G^a c^b M^c R^d\), where \(k\) is the dimensionless constant and \(a, b, c, d\) are exponents to be determined.

**Step 3: Set up dimensional equations.**  
The dimensions of the product are:  
\[
[G^a c^b M^c R^d] = \text{M}^{-a+c} \text{L}^{3a+b+d} \text{T}^{-2a-b}
\]  
Equating to \([L_{\text{GW}}]\) gives:  
\[
\begin{cases}
-a + c = 1 & \text{(mass)} \\
3a + b + d = 2 & \text{(length)} \\
-2a - b = -3 & \text{(time)}
\end{cases}
\]

**Step 4: Apply the condition that \(c\) and \(R\) have the same power.**  
This implies \(b = d\). Substituting into the equations:  
\[
\begin{cases}
c = 1 + a \\
3a + 2b = 2 \\
2a + b = 3
\end{cases}
\]  
Solving: from \(2a + b = 3\), we get \(b = 3 - 2a\). Substituting into \(3a + 2b = 2\):  
\[
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \Rightarrow 3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \Rightarrow -a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
\]  
Then \(b = 3 - 2 \times 4 = -5\), \(d = b = -5\), and \(c = 1 + 4 = 5\).

**Step 5: Write the expression with the dimensionless constant.**  
\[
L_{\text{GW}} = k \, G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5} = k \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
\]  
Given \(k = \frac{2}{5}\), we obtain:  
\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
\]

**Step 6: Verify with known general relativistic result.**  
For a binary system with equal masses \(M\), separation \(a = 2R\), the standard quadrupole formula gives:  
\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{\mu^2 M_{\text{total}}^3}{a^5}
\]  
where \(\mu = M/2\) is the reduced mass and \(M_{\text{total}} = 2M\). Substituting:  
\[
\mu^2 M_{\text{total}}^3 = \left(\frac{M}{2}\right)^2 (2M)^3 = \frac{M^2}{4} \cdot 8M^3 = 2M^5
\]  
\[
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{2M^5}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 \cdot 32 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
\]  
This confirms the expression.

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{L_{GW} = \dfrac{2}{5} \dfrac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}

This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"The rate of change of the orbital radius \(R\) with respect to time is given by:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
\]

### Derivation:

1. **Orbital energy of the binary system:**  
   For two identical neutron stars of mass \(M\) each orbiting at a distance \(R\) from the center of mass, the total mechanical energy \(E\) is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. The separation between the stars is \(2R\). The total energy is:
   \[
   E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
   \]

2. **Energy loss due to gravitational waves:**  
   The gravitational wave luminosity \(L_{\text{GW}}\) is the power radiated, so the rate of change of orbital energy satisfies:
   \[
   L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}
   \]

3. **Differentiate \(E\) with respect to time:**  
   Using the chain rule:
   \[
   \frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4R} \right) = \frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}
   \]

4. **Substitute the given expression for \(L_{\text{GW}}\):**  
   Given:
   \[
   L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
   \]
   Equating:
   \[
   \frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}\):**  
   Multiply both sides by \(\frac{4R^2}{G M^2}\):
   \[
   \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4R^2}{G M^2} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
   \]

Thus, the orbit shrinks over time as energy is radiated away by gravitational waves.",0.49
