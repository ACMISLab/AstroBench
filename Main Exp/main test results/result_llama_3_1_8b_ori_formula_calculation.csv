  ""To calculate the total radiative power of a star using the Stefan–Boltzmann law, we need to use the formula:

  - c: Speed of light (approximately equal to 299792458 m/s)
  - h: Planck constant (approximately equal to 6.62607015e-34 J s)

  First, we need to calculate the value of π^5, which is approximately equal to:

  k^4 ≈ (1.38064852e-23)^4 ≈ 4.893e-94

  ""solution"": 
  ""To calculate the physical quantity P, we need to know the specific scaling relation. However, based on the given information, it seems like we are dealing with the scaling relation of luminosity (L) or a similar quantity. 

  Assuming the scaling relation is in the form of L ∝ M^α * R^β, where α and β are exponents, we can use the relation L ∝ P. 

  However, without the exact relation, we'll use the general relation for luminosity, which is L ∝ M^3 * R^2. 

  We can rearrange this relation to solve for P, but since we don't have a direct relation for P, we'll assume P is proportional to L.

  Therefore, we can use the relation P ∝ M^3 * R^2.

  We can now plug in the given values for M and R to calculate P.

  First, we'll calculate the exponents of M and R in the relation P ∝ M^3 * R^2.

  The exponent of M is 3, and the exponent of R is 2.

  P ∝ 4.19562e+93 * 4.89639e+20

  P ∝ 2.05681e+113

  Since P is proportional to the calculated value, we can say P ∝ 2.05681e+113.

  However, to find the exact value of P, we need to know the proportionality constant Q.

  Given Q = 1.0, we can now find the exact value of P.

  P = Q * 2.05681e+113

  where G is the gravitational constant, a is the semi-major axis, and M is the mass of the central body.

  ""To solve this problem, we will use the Friedmann equation, which describes the evolution of the scale factor a in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The equation is given by:

  H² = (8πG/3)ρ - (k/a²) + Λ

  where:
  - H is the Hubble parameter (H = ȧ/a)
  - G is the gravitational constant (G = 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)
  - ρ is the total density of the universe (ρ = ρ_m + ρ_Λ)
  - ρ_m is the matter density
  - ρ_Λ is the density of the cosmological constant (ρ_Λ = Λc²)
  - c is the speed of light (c = 299792458 m/s)
  - k is the curvature parameter
  - a is the scale factor

  First, we need to calculate the total density of the universe:

  ρ = ρ_m + ρ_Λ
  ρ = 1.592e-27 kg/m³ + (7.694e-53 m⁻² * (299792458 m/s)²)
  ρ = 1.592e-27 kg/m³ + 7.285e-26 kg/m³
  ρ ≈ 7.887e-27 kg/m³

  Now, we can plug in the values into the Friedmann equation:

  H² = ((8π * 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)/3) * 7.887e-27 kg/m³ - (0/a²) + 7.694e-53 m⁻²
  H² = (8.677e-10 m² kg⁻¹ s⁻²) * 7.887e-27 kg/m³ + 7.694e-53 m⁻²
  H² = 6.844e-36 s⁻² + 7.694e-53 m⁻²
  H² ≈ 6.844e-36 s⁻²

  To find the Hubble parameter H, we take the square root of both sides:

  H = √(6.844e-36 s⁻²)
  H ≈ 2.62e-18 s⁻¹

  However, we are given the scale factor a, so we can calculate the Hubble time (the time it takes for the universe to expand to a given scale factor):

  Hubble time = a / H
  Hubble time = 8.81 / 2.62e-18 s⁻¹
  Hubble time ≈ 3.36e17 s

  H₀ = H / a
  H₀ = 2.62e-18 s⁻¹ / 8.81
  H₀ ≈ 2.97e-19 s⁻¹

  The Hubble constant is often expressed in units of km/s/Mpc. To convert it, we need to multiply by the speed of light and the number of megaparsecs in a kilometer:

  H₀ (km/s/Mpc) = (2.97e-19 s⁻¹) * (299792458 m/s) * (1 Mpc / 3.0857e19 m)

  The Friedmann equation for a flat Universe (Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1) is:

  H² = H₀² * (Ω_m * (1 + z)⁻³ + Ω_Λ)

  We can rearrange this equation to solve for z:

  (Ω_m * (1 + z)⁻³ + Ω_Λ) = H² / H₀²

  Since Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1, we can substitute Ω_Λ = 1 - Ω_m:

  (Ω_m * (1 + z)⁻³ + 1 - Ω_m) = H² / H₀²

  We can now solve for z using numerical methods or by plotting the function and finding the root.

  Once we have the redshift z, we can calculate the age of the Universe using the equation:

First, we need to convert the angular diameter from arcseconds to radians. We know that 1 arcsecond is equal to 1/(3600*180) radians.

  ""To calculate the relativistic Doppler effect, we will use the relativistic Doppler formula:

  where $m_e$ is the mass of an electron, $c$ is the speed of light, and $E_{\text{initial}}$ is the initial photon energy.

  First, we need to convert the initial photon energy from eV to Joules. We know that $1 \text{ eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$.

  $E_{\text{initial}} = 283.579 \text{ eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} = 4.548 \times 10^{-17} \text{ J}$

  # Step 1: Understand the given parameters
  The luminosity of the object is given as $L=213394.277 L_{\odot}$ and the minimum detectable flux is $F_{\min}=5.443e-21$ W/m². We also know that the luminosity of the Sun ($L_{\odot}$) is approximately $3.846e26$ W.

  # Step 2: Convert the luminosity from solar luminosity to Watts
  We can convert the luminosity of the object from solar luminosity to Watts by multiplying it with the luminosity of the Sun.
  $L = 213394.277 L_{\odot} = 213394.277 \times 3.846e26$ W

  # Step 3: Calculate the luminosity of the object in Watts
  $L = 8.203e29$ W

  # Step 4: Use the inverse square law to calculate the maximum detection distance
  The inverse square law states that the flux of a source decreases with the square of the distance. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$, where $F$ is the flux, $L$ is the luminosity, and $r$ is the distance. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the distance: $r = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}}$

  # Step 5: Plug in the values and calculate the maximum detection distance
  $r = \sqrt{\frac{8.203e29}{4\pi \times 5.443e-21}}$

  $r = \sqrt{1.201e31}$
  $r = 1.095e15$ m

  # Step 7: Convert the distance from meters to astronomical units (AU)
  1 AU is approximately equal to $1.496e11$ m. We can convert the distance from meters to AU by dividing it by the number of meters in an AU.
  $r = \frac{1.095e15}{1.496e11}$
  $r \approx 733.4$ AU

  # Step 8: Convert the distance from AU to light-years
  1 light-year is approximately equal to $9.461e12$ m or $63.241$ AU. We can convert the distance from AU to light-years by dividing it by the number of AU in a light-year.

  - $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin
  - $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight
  - $\rho$ is the mass density

  First, we need to calculate the term $\left( \frac{k_B T}{\mu} \right)^{3/2}$.

  $$\left( \frac{k_B T}{\mu} \right)^{3/2} = \left( \frac{1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J K}^{-1} \times 880.6 \, \text{K}}{1.53} \right)^{3/2}$$

  The Jacobi integral is given by:
  $J = \frac{1}{2} \mu r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{2 \mu r^2} - \frac{GM \mu}{r}$

  We need to calculate the reduced mass $\mu$:
  $\mu = \frac{M_{galaxy} M_{object}}{M_{galaxy} + M_{object}}$

  Since we don't know the mass of the object, we will assume that the reduced mass is equal to the mass of the object, $\mu = M_{object}$. This is a common assumption in many astrophysical problems.

  Now we can substitute the given values into the Jacobi integral formula:
  $J = \frac{1}{2} M_{object} r^2 \Omega^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{2 M_{object} r^2} - \frac{GM_{galaxy} M_{object}}{r}$

  We can simplify this expression by substituting the given values:

  We can simplify this expression further by substituting the value of $M_{object} = 1.607 \times 10^{30}$ kg:
  $J = \frac{1}{2} (1.607 \times 10^{30}) (1.794 \times 10^{21})^2 (8.817 \times 10^{-15})^2 + \frac{(3.434 \times 10^{12})^2}{2 (1.607 \times 10^{30}) (1.794 \times 10^{21})^2} - \frac{1.607 \times 10^{43} (1.607 \times 10^{30})}{1.794 \times 10^{21}}$

  $J = 1.409 \times 10^{4} + 1.267 \times 10^{4} - 2.872 \times 10^{13}$

  ""solution"": 
  ""To solve this problem, we will use the Schwarzschild radius formula, which is given by:

  $r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$

  where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius, $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$), $M$ is the mass of the object, and $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$).

  First, we need to convert the mass of the object from solar masses ($M_{\odot}$) to kilograms. The mass of the Sun is approximately $1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$, so we can write:

  $M = 53.6 \, M_{\odot} = 53.6 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$

  Next, we can plug in the values for $G$, $M$, and $c$ into the Schwarzschild radius formula:

  $r_s = \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \times (53.6 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg})}{(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2}$

  Simplifying the expression, we get:

  $r_s = \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 53.6 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}}$

  $r_s = \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 53.6 \times 1.989 \times 10^{19}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}}$

  $r_s = \frac{2 \times 35.65 \times 1.989 \times 10^{3}}{9.00}$

  $r_s = 15.67 \times 10^{3}$

  - $n_e$ and $n_i$ are the electron and ion number densities, respectively
  - $T$ is the temperature

  The formula to calculate LST is given by:
  LST = GST + (λ - λ_GST) * 4

  # Step 2: Convert GST from hours to degrees
  GST in hours is given as 18.29 hours. We need to convert this to degrees. There are 24 hours in a day and 360° in a circle, so the conversion factor is 360/24 = 15° per hour.
  GST_degrees = GST_hours * 15 = 18.29 * 15 = 274.35°

  # Step 3: Calculate the longitude difference
  The longitude difference is given by:
  λ_diff = λ - λ_GST
  where λ is the longitude of the location and λ_GST is the longitude of the Greenwich Meridian (0°).
  λ_diff = 61.38 - 0 = 61.38°

  # Step 4: Calculate the time difference in degrees
  We are given the time difference in hours as -0.66 hours. We need to convert this to degrees. Using the same conversion factor as before:
  time_diff_degrees = time_diff_hours * 15 = -0.66 * 15 = -9.9°

  # Step 5: Calculate the LST
  Now we can plug in the values into the formula:
  LST = GST_degrees + λ_diff * 4 + time_diff_degrees
  LST = 274.35 + 61.38 * 4 - 9.9
  LST = 274.35 + 245.52 - 9.9
  LST = 509.97 - 9.9
  LST = 500.07°

  # Step 6: Convert LST to hours
  We can convert LST from degrees to hours using the conversion factor:
  LST_hours = LST_degrees / 15 = 500.07 / 15 = 33.36 hours

  # Step 7: Adjust LST to be within 24 hours
  Since we are calculating the Local Sidereal Time, it should be within 24 hours. If it's not, we need to adjust it.
  If LST_hours > 24, we subtract 24 from it.
  If LST_hours < 0, we add 24 to it.

step2: Compute $\sin\beta$:
$\sin\beta = \sin(0.2314)\cos(0.4231) - \cos(0.2314)\sin(0.4231)\sin(0.2242)$

  ""solution"": 
  ""To solve the given system of equations for the ecliptic coordinates $(\beta,\lambda)$, we will follow these steps:

  1. **Compute $\sin\beta$**: We will use the first equation to compute $\sin\beta$. This equation is given by:
  $\sin\beta = \sin\delta \cos\varepsilon - \cos\delta \sin\varepsilon \sin\alpha$

  We are given the values of $\alpha=12.84^\circ$, $\delta=13.26^\circ$, and $\varepsilon=24.24^\circ$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
  $\sin\beta = \sin(13.26^\circ) \cos(24.24^\circ) - \cos(13.26^\circ) \sin(24.24^\circ) \sin(12.84^\circ)$

  Using a calculator to evaluate the trigonometric functions, we get:
  $\sin\beta \approx 0.2163$

  2. **Compute $\cos\beta$**: We can compute $\cos\beta$ using the identity $\sin^2\beta + \cos^2\beta = 1$. Rearranging this equation to solve for $\cos\beta$, we get:
  $\cos\beta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \sin^2\beta}$

  Substituting the value of $\sin\beta$ we computed earlier, we get:
  $\cos\beta = \pm \sqrt{1 - 0.2163^2}$

  Evaluating the expression, we get:
  $\cos\beta \approx 0.9793$

  Since $\cos\beta$ is positive, we take the positive square root.

  3. **Compute $\cos\lambda$**: We can use the second equation to compute $\cos\lambda$. This equation is given by:
  $\cos\beta \cos\lambda = \cos\delta \cos\alpha$

  Substituting the values of $\alpha=12.84^\circ$, $\delta=13.26^\circ$, and the computed value of $\cos\beta$, we get:
  $0.9793 \cos\lambda = \cos(13.26^\circ) \cos(12.84^\circ)$

  Using a calculator to evaluate the trigonometric functions, we get:
  $\cos\lambda \approx 0.9659$

  4. **Compute $\sin\lambda$**: We can use the third equation to compute $\sin\lambda$. This equation is given by:
  $\cos\beta \sin\lambda = \sin\delta \sin\varepsilon + \cos\delta \cos\varepsilon \sin\alpha$

  Substituting the values of $\alpha=12.84^\circ$, $\delta=13.26^\circ$, $\varepsilon=24.24^\circ$, and the computed value of $\cos\beta$, we get:
  $0.9793 \sin\lambda = \sin(13.26^\circ) \sin(24.24^\circ) + \cos(13.26^\circ) \cos(24.24^\circ) \sin(12.84^\circ)$

  Using a calculator to evaluate the trigonometric functions, we get:
  $\sin\lambda \approx 0.2119$

  5. **Compute $\lambda$ and $\beta$**: We can compute $\lambda$ and $\beta$ using the computed values of $\cos\lambda$, $\sin\lambda$, $\cos\beta$, and $\sin\beta$. We can use the following equations:
  $\lambda = \arctan\left(\frac{\sin\lambda}{\cos\lambda}\right)$
  $\beta = \arccos(\cos\beta)$

  Substituting the computed values, we get:
  $\lambda \approx \arctan\left(\frac{0.2119}{0.9659}\right) \approx 11.82^\circ$
  $\beta \approx \arccos(0.9793) \approx 10.93^\circ$

  Therefore, the ecliptic coordinates of the celestial object are $(\beta, \lambda) \approx (10.93^\circ, 11.82^\circ)$"",

  ""solution"": ""To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to convert the given UTC time to seconds. We can use the formula:
   \[ t = y + \frac{m-1}{12} + \frac{j-1}{720} + \frac{k-1}{60} + h + \frac{m}{60} + s \]
   where:
   - y is the year (2023 in this case)
   - m is the month (3 in this case)
   - j is the day of the year (86 in this case, since 2023-03-27 is the 86th day of the year)
   - k is the hour (19 in this case)
   - h is the minute (17 in this case)
   - m is the second (38 in this case)

2. Then, we can use the given formula to calculate TAI by adding the leap second correction ΔAT to the UTC time in seconds:

3. Finally, we can use the given formula to calculate TT by adding 32.184 seconds to TAI:
   \[ TT = TAI + 32.184\ \mathrm{seconds} \]

Now, let's calculate the values:

1. Convert the UTC time to seconds:
   \[ t = 2023 + \frac{3-1}{12} + \frac{86-1}{720} + 19 + \frac{17}{60} + \frac{38}{3600} \]

   \[ t \approx 2023 + 19.4795 \]
   \[ t \approx 2042.4795 \]

2. Calculate TAI:
   \[ TAI = t + \Delta AT \]
   \[ TAI = 2042.4795 + 10 \]
   \[ TAI \approx 2052.4795 \]

3. Calculate TT:
