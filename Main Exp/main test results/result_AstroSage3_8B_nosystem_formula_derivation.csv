Let there be only the Sun $\odot$ and a planet $P$. Establish an arbitrary spatial coordinate system $O-xyz$(As shown in the figure<image>GSTD-Fig-1</image>). $r_{\odot}$ is the position vector of the Sun, $r_{P}$ is the position vector of the planet, and $r$ is the position vector of the planet relative to the Sun. Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

$F_{P} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{2}} \frac{-r}{|r|} = -k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{3}} r$

From Newton’s second law: both the Sun and the planet accelerate under the action of force

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No," 

To solve this problem, we need to recall Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on a particle is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: $F = ma$. We also need to recall the definition of the virial, which is the sum of the inner product of the position vector and the resultant force acting on each molecule in the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: $V = \sum r \cdot F$. Now, we can substitute Newton's second law into the definition of the virial: $V = \sum r \cdot ma$. We can then rearrange this equation to get: $V = \sum r \cdot ma = \sum r \cdot ma = \sum mr \cdot a$. This equation represents the virial theorem, which states that the virial of a system is equal to the sum of the product of the mass and the acceleration of each molecule in the system. The virial theorem is a powerful tool for determining the mass of galaxies, as it allows us to relate the mass of a system to its dynamics. By applying the virial theorem, we can derive the mass of a galaxy based on its observed dynamics, such as its velocity dispersion and size. This is a key tool in the field of astronomy, as it allows us to study the mass distribution of galaxies and their role in the universe. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century, and it has since become a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and thermodynamics. In summary, the virial theorem is a powerful tool for determining the mass of galaxies, and it is based on the principle that the virial of a system is equal to the sum of the product of the mass and the acceleration of each molecule in the system.

$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + V = \varepsilon$",No," 

To solve this problem, we will use the following steps: 1. Understand the given dynamical equation. 2. Identify the conserved quantities. 3. Derive the first integrals of motion.

Step 1: Understand the given dynamical equation. The given dynamical equation is a system of second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the motion of N bodies in a gravitational field. Each body is represented by its mass $m_i$ and position vector $\mathbf{r}_i$. The equation of motion for the $i$-th body is given by:

$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$

Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ is the acceleration of the $i$-th body.

Step 2: Identify the conserved quantities. The dynamical equation is invariant under time translation and spatial translation. This means that the total energy and the total linear momentum are conserved quantities. The total energy $E$ is given by:

$E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \left|\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\right|^{2} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$

The total linear momentum $\mathbf{P$ is given by:

$\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$

Step 3: Derive the first integrals of motion. The first integrals of motion are the conserved quantities that can be expressed as functions of the coordinates and momenta. In this case, we have two conserved quantities: the total energy $E$ and the total linear momentum $\mathbf{P$. These can be expressed as:

$E = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \left|\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}\right|^{2} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$

$\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$

These equations represent the first integrals of motion for an N-body system. They are conserved quantities that do not change with time and can be used to describe the motion of the system. The total energy $E$ represents the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system, while the total linear momentum $\mathbf{P$ represents the sum of the momenta of all the bodies in the system. These quantities are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the system and for making predictions about its behavior.",0.714

Equation (i): For an elliptical orbit, when $f=0$ (periapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its minimum value: $r_{P}=\frac{p}{1+e}=a(1-e)$

Equation (ii): When $f=\pi$ (apoapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its maximum value: $r_{A}=\frac{p}{1-e}=a(1+e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No," where $e$ is the eccentricity and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Here is the problem-solving process: To prove the given equation for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion, we will use the following steps:

1. Recall the definitions of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and the vis-viva equation.
2. Apply the vis-viva equation to find the velocity at aphelion and perihelion.
3. Simplify the resulting expressions to obtain the desired equations for $v_{A}$ and $v_{P$.

Step 1: Recall the definitions of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and the vis-viva equation.

The semi-major axis $a$ is the average distance of the celestial body from the central body, and it is related to the total energy of the system. The eccentricity $e$ is a measure of the shape of the orbit, with $e=0$ corresponding to a circular orbit and $e=1$ corresponding to a parabolic orbit. The vis-viva equation relates the velocity of the celestial body to its distance from the central body and the total energy of the system.

Step 2: Apply the vis-viva equation to find the velocity at aphelion and perihelion.

The vis-viva equation is given by:

$v^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)$

where $v$ is the velocity of the celestial body, $\mu$ is the standard gravitational parameter, $r$ is the distance from the central body, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.

At aphelion, the distance from the central body is at its maximum, which is given by:

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

Substituting this into the vis-viva equation, we get:

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{a}-\frac{1}{a(1+e)}\right)$

At perihelion, the distance from the central body is at its minimum, which is given by:

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

Substituting this into the vis-viva equation, we get:

$v_{P}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1-e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$v_{P}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{2}{a}-\frac{1}{a(1-e)}\right)$

Step 3: Simplify the resulting expressions to obtain the desired equations for $v_{A}$ and $v_{P$.

We can rewrite the expressions for $v_{A}^{2}$ and $v_{P}^{2}$ as:

$v_{A}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{1-e}{a}\right)$

$v_{P}^{2}=\mu\left(\frac{1+e}{a}\right)$

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$

This proves the given equation for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion. The velocities at aphelion and perihelion are indeed given by the equations:

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}$

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$.

This is the solution to the problem.

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,".

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of gravitational force and the conservation of energy. Let's start by considering the gravitational force acting on the satellite due to the planet. The gravitational force is given by:

\[ F = \frac{GMm}{d^2} \]

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, and $d$ is the distance between the center of the planet and the satellite.

Now, we can use the conservation of energy to relate the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$. The total energy of the satellite is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

where $v$ is the velocity of the satellite. The potential energy is given by:

\[ U = -\frac{GMm}{d} \]

The total energy is given by:

\[ E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{d} \]

Since the satellite is in a stable orbit, its total energy remains constant. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{d} = \text{constant} \]

Now, we can use the fact that the satellite is in a circular orbit, so its velocity is given by:

\[ v = \frac{2\pi d}{P} \]

Substituting this into the equation for total energy, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{2\pi d}{P}\right)^2 - \frac{GMm}{d} = \text{constant} \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ \frac{4\pi^2d^2}{P^2} - \frac{GM}{d} = \text{constant} \]

Now, we can use the fact that the average density of the planet is $\rho$, so the mass of the planet is given by:

\[ M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\rho \]

Substituting this into the equation for total energy, we get:

\[ \frac{4\pi^2d^2}{P^2} - \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3G\rho}{d} = \text{constant} \]

Now, we can solve for $P$ in terms of $d$:

\[ P = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{d^3}{GM}} \]

Substituting the expression for $M$, we get:

\[ P = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{d^3}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3G\rho}} \]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

\[ P = \sqrt{\frac{3\pi d^3}{GMR^3\rho} \]

This is the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet. The problem-solving process involved using the concepts of gravitational force and the conservation of energy to derive the expression for the period of the satellite. The final expression is a function of the distance $d$, the radius $R$, the average density $\rho$, and the gravitational constant $G$.",0.637

# Solution
To solve this problem, we need to use the formulas for rotational velocity and radial velocity dispersion. For Galaxy A, the rotational velocity at a distance R from its center is given by the formula: v = √(GM/R) where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the galaxy. For Galaxy B, the radial velocity dispersion at a distance R from its center is given by the formula: v = √(σ²/R) where σ is the radial velocity dispersion. Since both galaxies have the same rotational velocity and radial velocity dispersion, we can set the two formulas equal to each other: √(GM/R) = √(σ²/R) Now, we can solve for M and σ. First, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: GM/R = σ²/R Then, we can multiply both sides by R to get rid of the denominator: GM = σ²R Now, we can solve for M by dividing both sides by G: M = σ²R/G Since we are given that both galaxies have the same radius R and the same rotational velocity and radial velocity dispersion v, we can substitute v for σ in the formula: M = v²R/G Now, we can calculate the mass of both galaxies using this formula.

The gravitational pressure is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V} = -\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3GM^2}{5R}\right)\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\right)^{-1}$

Substituting the expression for $R$ in terms of $M$ and $\rho$, we get

$p_{grav} = -\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3GM^2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{-1}$

Equating the electron degeneracy pressure and the gravitational pressure, we get

$\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}\right)(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{ZA}{M}\right)^{5/3}\left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3M}\right)^{5/3} = -\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3GM^2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{-1}$

Solving for $\rho$, we get

$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}\right)(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{ZA}{M}\right)^{5/3}\right)^{3/5}\left(\frac{3GM^2}{5}\right)^{3/5}}$

13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

To solve this problem, we need to first find the magnetic field created by dipole 1 at the location of dipole 2, and then use the formula for the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field to find the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$. We will then use the given information about the intrinsic magnetic moments of the electron and proton to find the interaction energy of the two hydrogen atoms. Finally, we will use the fact that the energy of a photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states to find the energy of the 21cm spectral line of hydrogen. The problem-solving process is as follows:

The magnetic field created by dipole 1 at the location of dipole 2 is given by the formula:

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}}{r^3}$

2. Find the potential energy of dipole 2 in the magnetic field created by dipole 1:

The potential energy of dipole 2 in the magnetic field created by dipole 1 is given by the formula:

$U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}$

3. Find the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ between the two dipoles:

The interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ is the sum of the potential energies of the two dipoles in each other's magnetic field:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B} - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}$

4. Use the given information about the intrinsic magnetic moments of the electron and proton to find the interaction energy of the two hydrogen atoms:

The intrinsic magnetic moments of the electron and proton are given by:

$\mu_e = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$

The interaction energy of the two hydrogen atoms is given by:

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B} - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}$

5. Use the fact that the energy of a photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states to find the energy of the 21cm spectral line of hydrogen:

The energy of the 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is given by:

$E_{21} = h\nu = 2\pi\hbar\nu = h\frac{c}{\lambda}$

# Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the following equations: 
1. The Coulombic potential energy between two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by: 
   $V(r) = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r$}
2. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by: 
   $K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2$, where $v$ is the velocity of the electron.
3. The orbital momentum of the electron is given by: 
   $L = m_e v r$.

First, let's find the velocity of the electron. The centripetal force required to keep the electron in circular orbit is equal to the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the proton. Therefore, we can write: 
$F_c = \frac{m_e v^2}{r = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$. Solving for $v$, we get: 
$v = \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e r}$.

Now, we can find the total energy of the electron. The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy: 
$E_{total} = K + V = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r$.
Substituting the expression for $v$, we get: 
$E_{total} = \frac{1}{2} m_e \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e r}} + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r$.

Finally, we can find the orbital momentum of the electron: 
$L = m_e v r = m_e \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e r}} r = \sqrt{m_e e^2 r}$.

So, the total energy of the electron is: 
$E_{total} = \frac{1}{2} m_e \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e r}} + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r$ and the orbital momentum is: 
$L = \sqrt{m_e e^2 r}$. 

The problem-solving process involved using the Coulombic potential energy and the kinetic energy of the electron to find the total energy and the orbital momentum. The centripetal force was used to find the velocity of the electron, which was then used to find the total energy and the orbital momentum. The result is a set of expressions for the total energy and the orbital momentum of the electron in terms of its mass, the electric charge, and the radius of its orbit.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

The problem can be solved in several steps. First, we need to find the speed of the meteorite just before the collision. Then, we need to determine the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate. After that, we need to find the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate. Finally, we need to find the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of angular momentum and energy. The conservation of angular momentum states that the angular momentum of a system is conserved if there are no external torques acting on the system. The conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system is conserved if there are no external forces acting on the system.

Let's start by finding the speed of the meteorite just before the collision. We can use the conservation of angular momentum to find the speed of the meteorite. The angular momentum of the meteorite before the collision is equal to the angular momentum of the conglomerate after the collision. Let's denote the speed of the meteorite just before the collision as v1. The angular momentum of the meteorite before the collision is m1 * v1 * R. The angular momentum of the conglomerate after the collision is (m1 + m2) * v2 * R/2, where v2 is the speed of the conglomerate after the collision. Since the angular momentum is conserved, we have:

m1 * v1 * R = (m1 + m2) * v2 * R/2

Now, let's find the speed of the meteorite just before the collision. We can rearrange the equation to solve for v1:

v1 = (m1 + m2) * v2 / (2 * m1)

Next, we need to determine the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate. Since the minimum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is R/2, the orbit of the conglomerate is an ellipse with a semi-major axis of R/2. The shape of the orbit is determined by the ratio of the semi-major axis to the semi-minor axis, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, the orbit of the conglomerate is a circle.

Now, let's find the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate. The minimum speed of the conglomerate occurs when it is at the minimum distance from the center of the Earth, which is R/2. The maximum speed of the conglomerate occurs when it is at the maximum distance from the center of the Earth, which is R. The speed of the conglomerate at any point in its orbit is given by:

v = sqrt(G * M / r)

where r is the distance from the center of the Earth. Substituting R/2 for r, we get the minimum speed of the conglomerate:

v_min = sqrt(G * M / (R/2)) = 2 * sqrt(G * M / R)

Substituting R for r, we get the maximum speed of the conglomerate:

v_max = sqrt(G * M / R)

Finally, let's find the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth. Since the orbit of the conglomerate is a circle with a radius of R/2, the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is R/2.

Now, let's determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible. The condition is that the meteorite and the space station must have a mass ratio such that the meteorite can collide with the space station and form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of R/2. This condition is satisfied if the mass of the meteorite is less than or equal to the mass of the space station. Therefore, the condition is:

m1 <= m2

This condition ensures that the meteorite and the space station can collide and form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit with a minimum distance of R/2. If the mass of the meteorite is greater than the mass of the space station, the meteorite will not collide with the space station and the scenario will not be possible.",0.833

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and surface magnitude. We also need to use the inverse square law for light intensity and the formula for solid angle. Let's start by defining the terms: 1. Apparent magnitude: It is the measure of the brightness of an object as seen from Earth. 2. Absolute magnitude: It is the measure of the intrinsic brightness of an object, which is independent of its distance from Earth. 3. Surface magnitude: It is the measure of the brightness of a galaxy per unit solid angle, usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$. Now, let's use the inverse square law for light intensity: $I = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$, where $I$ is the intensity of light, $L$ is the luminosity of the object, and $r$ is the distance to the object. We can also use the formula for solid angle: $A = \frac{4\pi r^2}{D^2}$, where $A$ is the solid angle, $r$ is the distance to the object, and $D$ is the angular diameter of the object. Now, let's define the surface magnitude of a galaxy: $M_s = m - 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{A}{A_0}$, where $M_s$ is the surface magnitude, $m$ is the apparent magnitude, and $A_0$ is the solid angle of a reference object (usually the Sun). We can rewrite this formula using the formula for solid angle: $M_s = m - 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{4\pi r^2}{D^2 A_0}$. Now, let's substitute the inverse square law for light intensity: $M_s = m - 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \frac{D^2 A_0}{4\pi r^2}$. Simplifying, we get: $M_s = m - 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \frac{D^2 A_0}{4\pi r^2}$.

Now, let's use the fact that the luminosity of an object is proportional to its absolute magnitude: $L = 10^{0.4(M - M_0)}$, where $M_0$ is the absolute magnitude of a reference object (usually the Sun). Substituting this into the formula for surface magnitude, we get: $M_s = M - 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{10^{0.4(M - M_0)}}{4\pi r^2} \frac{D^2 A_0}{4\pi r^2}$.

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane.

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No," 

# Solution
To derive Kepler's laws based on the law of universal gravitation, we need to consider the motion of planets around the Sun. The law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2

where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

Now, let's consider a planet of mass m orbiting the Sun of mass M. The gravitational force acting on the planet is:

F = G * (M * m) / r^2

This force is responsible for the planet's acceleration, which can be expressed as:

a = F / m = G * M / r^2

Now, let's consider the motion of the planet in a two-dimensional plane. The planet's velocity vector v can be resolved into two components: v_r (tangential velocity) and v_t (radial velocity). The tangential velocity is the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the radius vector, while the radial velocity is the component that is parallel to the radius vector.

Using the chain rule, we can express the radial acceleration as:

a_r = dv_r/dt = d(v_t * r) / dt = v_t * dr/dt + r * dv_t/dt

Since the radial acceleration is directed towards the Sun, we can write:

a_r = -G * M / r^2

Now, let's consider the tangential acceleration. The tangential acceleration is the component of the acceleration that is perpendicular to the radius vector. Since the tangential acceleration is directed towards the center of the orbit, we can write:

a_t = -v_t^2 / r

Now, let's combine these two equations to get the equation of motion for the planet:

v_t * dr/dt + r * dv_t/dt = -G * M / r^2

This equation can be rewritten as:

dv_t/dt + 2 * v_t * dr/dt / r = -G * M / r^3

Now, let's make the substitution u = 1/r. This gives us:

dv_t/du + 2 * v_t = -G * M * u

Now, let's integrate this equation to get:

v_t = -G * M / u + C

where C is a constant of integration. This is the equation of motion for the planet in terms of the radial distance u. Now, let's consider the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum of the planet is given by:

L = m * v_t * r

Since the angular momentum is conserved, we can write:

L = m * (-G * M / u + C) * u

Now, let's make the substitution L = m * C. This gives us:

L = -G * M * u^2 + C * u

Now, let's consider the conservation of energy. The total energy of the planet is given by:

E = (1/2) * m * v_t^2 - G * M / r

Since the total energy is conserved, we can write:

E = (1/2) * m * (-G * M / u + C)^2 - G * M / u

Now, let's make the substitution E = -G * M / 2a, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. This gives us:

E = -G * M / (2 * a) + (1/2) * m * C^2 - G * M / u

Now, let's combine these two equations to get:

E = -G * M / (2 * a) + (1/2) * m * C^2 - G * M / u

Now, let's solve for u in terms of E and C:

u = G * M / (2 * E + G * M - m * C^2)

Now, let's substitute this expression for u back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = -G * M / (G * M / (2 * E + G * M - m * C^2)) + C

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

v_t = sqrt(2 * E + G * M - m * C^2)

Now, let's substitute this expression for v_t back into the equation for L:

L = m * C

Now, let's solve for C in terms of L:

C = L / m

Now, let's substitute this expression for C back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt(2 * E + G * M - (L^2 / m^2))

Now, let's substitute this expression for v_t back into the equation for E:

E = -G * M / (2 * a) + (1/2) * m * (L^2 / m^2) - G * M / (G * M / (2 * E + G * M - (L^2 / m^2)))

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

E = -G * M / (2 * a) + (1/2) * (L^2 / m) - G * M / (2 * E + G * M - (L^2 / m^2))

Now, let's solve for E in terms of L and a:

E = (1/2) * (L^2 / m) - G * M / (2 * a)

Now, let's substitute this expression for E back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M / a)

Now, let's substitute this expression for v_t back into the equation for L:

L = m * C

Now, let's solve for C in terms of L:

C = L / m

Now, let's substitute this expression for C back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M / a)

Now, let's substitute this expression for v_t back into the equation for L:

L = m * v_t * r

Now, let's solve for r in terms of L and v_t:

r = L / (m * v_t)

Now, let's substitute this expression for r back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M / (L / (m * v_t))

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / (L * v_t)

Now, let's square both sides of this equation to get:

v_t^2 = (L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / L

Now, let's multiply both sides of this equation by m to get:

m * v_t^2 = L^2 - 2 * G * M * m

Now, let's rearrange this equation to get:

L^2 = m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m

Now, let's take the square root of both sides of this equation to get:

L = sqrt(m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m)

Now, let's substitute this expression for L back into the equation for r:

r = L / (m * v_t)

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

r = sqrt(m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m) / (m * v_t)

Now, let's substitute this expression for r back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M / (L / (m * v_t))

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / (L * v_t)

Now, let's square both sides of this equation to get:

v_t^2 = (L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / L

Now, let's multiply both sides of this equation by m to get:

m * v_t^2 = L^2 - 2 * G * M * m

Now, let's rearrange this equation to get:

L^2 = m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m

Now, let's take the square root of both sides of this equation to get:

L = sqrt(m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m)

Now, let's substitute this expression for L back into the equation for r:

r = L / (m * v_t)

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

r = sqrt(m * v_t^2 + 2 * G * M * m) / (m * v_t)

Now, let's substitute this expression for r back into the equation for v_t:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M / (L / (m * v_t))

Now, let's simplify this expression to get:

v_t = sqrt((L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / (L * v_t)

Now, let's square both sides of this equation to get:

v_t^2 = (L^2 / m) - 2 * G * M * m / L

Now, let",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No," 

## Problem Solving Process

To solve this problem, we will first derive the expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the actual observed rotation curve and the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter. We will then compare the two cases to understand the effect of dark matter on the rotation curve of the Galaxy.

### Case (I): Actual Observed Rotation Curve

For the actual observed rotation curve, we will use the expressions for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components derived by Jan Oort. The line-of-sight velocity is given by:

\[V_{r} = AD\sin2l\]

Differentiating this expression with respect to the distance D, we get:

\[\frac{dV_{r}}{dD} = A\sin2l\]

Now, we need to find the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, which is at a distance R0 = 8.5 kpc from the Galactic Centre. To do this, we will use the expression for the transverse velocity component:

\[V_{t} = AD\cos2l + BD\]

Differentiating this expression with respect to the distance D, we get:

\[\frac{dV_{t}}{dD} = A\cos2l + B\]

Now, we can use the fact that the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV_{r}}{dD} \frac{dD}{dR} + \frac{dV_{t}}{dD} \frac{dD}{dR}\]

Since the Sun is at a distance R0 from the Galactic Centre, we have:

\[\frac{dD}{dR} = 1\]

Substituting this into the expression for the radial gradient, we get:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = A\sin2l + A\cos2l + B\]

### Case (II): Hypothetical Scenario with No Dark Matter

In this case, we will assume that the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and that all the mass of the Galaxy is concentrated at its centre. This means that the angular velocity of the Sun will be equal to the angular velocity of the HI cloud at the same distance from the Galactic Centre. Therefore, the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components will be given by:

\[V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l\]

\[V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D\]

Differentiating these expressions with respect to the distance D, we get:

\[\frac{dV_{r}}{dD} = -\Omega_{0}\sin l\]

\[\frac{dV_{t}}{dD} = -\Omega\]

Now, we can use the fact that the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = \frac{dV_{r}}{dD} \frac{dD}{dR} + \frac{dV_{t}}{dD} \frac{dD}{dR}\]

Substituting this into the expression for the radial gradient, we get:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\Omega_{0}\sin l - \Omega\]

### Comparison of the Two Cases

Now, we can compare the expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the actual observed rotation curve and the hypothetical scenario with no dark matter. We see that the radial gradient in the hypothetical scenario is negative, while the radial gradient in the actual observed rotation curve is positive. This means that the presence of dark matter causes the rotation curve of the Galaxy to rise more steeply than it would in the absence of dark matter.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the presence of dark matter has a significant effect on the rotation curve of the Galaxy. The radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is positive in the actual observed rotation curve, while it is negative in the hypothetical scenario with no dark matter. This suggests that the mass of the Galaxy is not concentrated at its centre, but rather is distributed throughout the Galaxy, including in the form of dark matter. This is consistent with the idea that dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. 

## Answer

The radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the actual observed rotation curve is given by:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = A\sin2l + A\cos2l + B\]

The radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun for the hypothetical scenario with no dark matter is given by:

\[\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}} = -\Omega_{0}\sin l - \Omega\]

The presence of dark matter causes the rotation curve of the Galaxy to rise more steeply than it would in the absence of dark matter, as indicated by the positive radial gradient in the actual observed rotation curve and the negative radial gradient in the hypothetical scenario with no dark matter. This suggests that dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. 

## Additional Information

The Oort constants A and B are important parameters in the study of the rotation curve of the Galaxy. They are related to the angular velocities of the Sun and the HI cloud at the same distance from the Galactic Centre. The Oort constant A is related to the difference in angular velocities, while the Oort constant B is related to the angular velocity of the Sun. The values of these constants can be determined from observations of the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components of HI clouds in the Galaxy. 

The presence of dark matter is inferred from the observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, which rises more steeply than it would in the absence of dark matter. This suggests that the mass of the Galaxy is not concentrated at its centre, but rather is distributed throughout the Galaxy, including in the form of dark matter. The study of the rotation curve of the Galaxy is an important tool for understanding the distribution of mass in the Galaxy and the role of dark matter in its formation and evolution.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No," 

To solve this problem, we will first express the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components in terms of Oort's constants A and B. Then, we will derive expressions for A and B in terms of the given parameters. Finally, we will compare the results for the actual observed rotation curve and the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter. Let's start by expressing the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components in terms of Oort's constants A and B. We have: $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$ $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$ Now, we can use the first-order approximation for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components: $V_{r} = AD\sin2l$ $V_{t} = AD\cos2l + BD$ Comparing the two sets of equations, we get: $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l = AD\sin2l$ $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D = AD\cos2l + BD$ Now, we can use the fact that the Sun is at a distance $R_0$ from the GC and the HI cloud is at a distance $R$ from the GC. We can express the angular velocities in terms of the rotational velocities: $\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$ $\Omega_{0} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}$ Now, we can substitute these expressions into the equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components: $\frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l = AD\sin2l$ $\frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D = AD\cos2l + BD$ Now, we can use the fact that the Sun is in a circular orbit around the GC, so the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by: $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}$ Now, we can substitute this expression into the equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components: $\frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l = AD\sin2l$ $\frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D = AD\cos2l + BD$ Now, we can solve for A and B: $A = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l$ $B = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D$ Now, we can substitute the expressions for A and B into the equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components: $V_{r} = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l D\sin2l$ $V_{t} = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l D\cos2l + \left(\frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D\right)D$ Now, we can simplify these expressions: $V_{r} = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} D\sin2l$ $V_{t} = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} D\cos2l + \frac{V}{R}R_{0} D - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D^{2}$ Now, we can compare the results for the actual observed rotation curve and the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter. In the actual observed rotation curve, the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by: $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}$ In the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter, the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by: $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}} = 0$ Therefore, the expressions for A and B will be different in the two scenarios. In the actual observed rotation curve, we have: $A = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l$ $B = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l - \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}D$ In the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter, we have: $A = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \sin l$ $B = \frac{V}{R}R_{0} \cos l$ Therefore, the expressions for A and B will be different in the two scenarios. This is because the presence of dark matter affects the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, which in turn affects the expressions for A and B. In conclusion, we have derived expressions for Oort's constants A and B in terms of the given parameters for both the actual observed rotation curve and the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter. The expressions for A and B will be different in the two scenarios due to the presence of dark matter affecting the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun. This highlights the importance of considering dark matter in the study of the rotation curve of the Galaxy.",0.728

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,".

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to consider the gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy of the gas element as it moves from $R_{max}$ to a radius r. The gravitational potential energy of the gas element at a distance r from the compact object is given by:

$U(r) = -\frac{GMm}{r$

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the compact object, and m is the mass of the gas element. The kinetic energy of the gas element in a circular orbit at radius r is given by:

$K(r) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{GM}{r}\right)$

where v is the orbital velocity of the gas element. The total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element as it moves from $R_{max}$ to radius r is given by the difference between the initial and final potential and kinetic energies:

$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = U(R_{max}) - U(r) + K(r) - K(R_{max})$

Substituting the expressions for U and K, we get:

$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GMm}{R_{max} + \frac{GM}{r} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GMm}{R_{max}}$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GMm}{R_{max}}\left(1 - \frac{R_{max}}{r}\right)$

This is the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element as it moves from $R_{max}$ to radius r. Note that this expression is valid only when $r \ll R_{max}$, as the assumption of a Keplerian circular orbit breaks down for larger radii. The expression is given in terms of G, M, and r, as required.",0.728

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the Hubble constant, the speed of light, and the distance between the Solar System and the mirror. We can start by considering the time it takes for the laser beam to travel to the mirror and back, which is given by $T=2D/c$. We can then use the law $S=se^{H_{0}t$ to find the expression for $H_0$ in terms of $D, c$, and $T$. First, we need to find the time $t$ it takes for the mirror to move a distance $S$ away from the Solar System. We can do this by rearranging the law to get $t=S/(se^{H_{0}t})$. Since $S=2D$ and $se^{H_{0}t=se^{H_{0}T=se^{2H_{0}D/c}$, we can substitute these into the equation to get $t=2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c})$. Now, we can use this expression for $t$ to find the expression for $H_{0}$ in terms of $D, c$, and $T$. We can do this by substituting $t=2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c})$ into the law $S=se^{H_{0}t$ to get $2D=se^{H_{0(2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c}))}$. Simplifying this equation, we get $2D=se^{2H_{0}D/c}e^{H_{0(2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c}))}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\ln(2D)=\ln(se^{2H_{0}D/c)+\ln(e^{H_{0(2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c}))})$. Using the property of logarithms, we can simplify this equation to get $\ln(2D)=\ln(s)+2H_{0}D/c+H_{0(2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c}))}$. Now, we can use the approximation $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$ to simplify the expression for $H_{0}$. We can do this by expanding the terms in the equation to get $\ln(2D)=\ln(s)+2H_{0}D/c+H_{0(2D/(se^{2H_{0}D/c)))}.

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No," The answer is: $L_{GW}=\frac{32}{5}\frac{GM^{2}}{R^{4}c^{5}$. The process of solving this problem is as follows: 1. First, we need to understand that the system is in a circular orbit, and we are looking for the gravitational wave luminosity. 2. The gravitational wave luminosity is a measure of the energy radiated away by the system in the form of gravitational waves. 3. In this case, we can use the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativity is $\frac{2}{5}$ to find the expression for $L_{GW$. 4. We know that the gravitational wave luminosity is proportional to the product of the masses of the neutron stars, the square of their radius, and the inverse fifth power of the speed of light. 5. So, the expression for $L_{GW}$ can be written as $L_{GW} \propto M^{2}R^{4}c^{-5$. 6. To find the constant of proportionality, we can use the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativity is $\frac{2}{5$. 7. Therefore, the expression for $L_{GW}$ is $L_{GW}=\frac{32}{5}\frac{GM^{2}}{R^{4}c^{5}$. This expression tells us the rate at which energy is being radiated away by the system in the form of gravitational waves. 8. Note that the expression includes the physical constants $G$ and $c$, as well as the masses and radius of the neutron stars. 9. This expression can be used to study the behavior of the system over time, and to understand how the energy radiated away by gravitational waves affects the orbit of the neutron stars. 10. It is important to note that this expression is an approximation, and that the actual behavior of the system may be more complex than this simple model suggests. However, this expression provides a useful starting point for understanding the general relativistic effects on binary neutron star systems.",0.637

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given expression
The problem is asking to find the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time $t$ in a binary neutron star system. The given expression for the luminosity of gravitational waves is $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$. This expression is in terms of the gravitational constant $G$, the mass of the neutron stars $M$, the radius of the orbit $R$, and the speed of light $c$. The hint suggests using the chain rule to differentiate the expression with respect to time. 

## Step 2: Apply the hint and differentiate the expression
Using the hint, we can differentiate the expression for $L_{GW}$ with respect to time $t$. Let's start by differentiating the expression with respect to $R$ first, and then use the chain rule to differentiate with respect to $t$. 

First, differentiate the expression with respect to $R$: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}R = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^6 c^5}
\]

Next, use the chain rule to differentiate with respect to $t$: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}R} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^6 c^5} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t
\]

## Step 3: Relate the luminosity of gravitational waves to the rate of change of the radius
The luminosity of gravitational waves is related to the rate of change of the radius of the orbit. The luminosity is given by the expression for $L_{GW}$, and the rate of change of the radius is given by $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$. We can equate the two expressions and solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$: 
\[
-\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^6 c^5} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t = L_{GW}
\]

## Step 4: Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$
To solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$, we can rearrange the equation to isolate $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{5L_{GW R^6 c^5}}{2G^4 M^5}
\]

## Step 5: Substitute the expression for $L_{GW}$
Now we can substitute the expression for $L_{GW}$ into the equation: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{5 \left(\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}\right) R^6 c^5}{2G^4 M^5}
\]

## Step 6: Simplify the expression
Simplifying the expression, we get: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{5R^6 c^5}{2G^4 M^5} = -\frac{2R}{5c^3}
\]

## Step 7: Final answer
The final answer is: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2R}{5c^3}
\]

This expression gives the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time $t$ in a binary neutron star system. 

## Step 8: Interpret the result
The result shows that the radius of the orbit is decreasing over time due to the emission of gravitational waves. The rate of change of the radius is proportional to the radius itself, and inversely proportional to the cube of the speed of light. This means that as the radius decreases, the rate of change of the radius also decreases. 

## Step 9: Discuss the implications of the result
The result has important implications for the study of binary neutron star systems and the emission of gravitational waves. It shows that the emission of gravitational waves causes the orbit to shrink over time, which in turn affects the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted. This can be used to test general relativity and to study the properties of neutron stars and their interactions. 

## Step 10: Conclusion
In conclusion, we have derived an expression for the rate of change of the radius of the circular orbit in a binary neutron star system due to the emission of gravitational waves. The result shows that the radius decreases over time, and the rate of change of the radius is proportional to the radius itself and inversely proportional to the cube of the speed of light. This has important implications for the study of binary neutron star systems and the emission of gravitational waves. 

The final answer is: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2R}{5c^3}
\]

This is the rate of change of the radius of the circular orbit with respect to time in a binary neutron star system. 

## Step 11: Verify the result
To verify the result, we can substitute the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$ into the expression for $L_{GW}$ and check if it satisfies the original expression. We can also use numerical methods to solve the equations and compare the results with the analytical solution. 

## Step 12: Discuss the limitations of the result
The result assumes that the binary neutron star system can be approximated as a Newtonian circular orbit, and that the emission of gravitational waves does not significantly affect the orbit. In reality, the emission of gravitational waves can cause the orbit to become eccentric and the neutron stars to spiral towards each other. This effect is known as gravitational wave inspiral, and it is important to include in the analysis of binary neutron star systems. 

## Step 13: Future work
Future work could involve incorporating the effects of gravitational wave inspiral into the analysis, and studying the properties of neutron stars and their interactions in more detail. This could involve using numerical methods to solve the equations and compare the results with observations of binary neutron star systems. 

## Step 14: Summary
In summary, we have derived an expression for the rate of change of the radius of the circular orbit in a binary neutron star system due to the emission of gravitational waves. The result shows that the radius decreases over time, and the rate of change of the radius is proportional to the radius itself and inversely proportional to the cube of the speed of light. This has important implications for the study of binary neutron star systems and the emission of gravitational waves. 

The final answer is: 
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2R}{5c^3}
\]

This is the rate of change of the radius of the circular orbit with respect to time in a binary neutron star system. 

## Step 15: Final thoughts

The results of this analysis can be used to test general relativity and to study the properties of neutron stars and their interactions. Future work could involve incorporating the effects of gravitational wave inspiral into the analysis, and studying the properties of neutron stars and their interactions in more detail.
