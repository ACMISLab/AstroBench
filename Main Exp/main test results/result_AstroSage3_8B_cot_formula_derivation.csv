Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to:

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No," 

To derive the virial theorem, we will first use Newton's second law to express the force on a molecule in terms of its acceleration. Then, we will sum the inner product of the position vector and force over all molecules in the system to obtain the virial. Finally, we will use the definition of the virial to derive the virial theorem. Let's start by using Newton's second law, which states that the force on a molecule is equal to its mass times its acceleration: $F = m \cdot a$. We can rewrite this as $F = m \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2$, where $r$ is the position vector of the molecule. Now, let's consider the inner product of the position vector and force for a single molecule: $r \cdot F = r \cdot (m \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2})$. We can rewrite this as $r \cdot F = m \cdot r \cdot \frac{d^2r}{dt^2$. Next, we sum the inner product of the position vector and force over all molecules in the system: $\sum r \cdot F = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot r_i \cdot \frac{d^2r_i}{dt^2$, where $N$ is the total number of molecules in the system. This sum is called the virial. Now, let's use the definition of the virial to derive the virial theorem. The virial theorem states that the time average of the virial is equal to twice the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = 2 \cdot \langle K \rangle$, where $\langle \rangle$ denotes the time average. We can rewrite the left-hand side of this equation as: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot r_i \cdot \frac{d^2r_i}{dt^2 \rangle$. Using Newton's second law, we can rewrite this as: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot r_i \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \frac{dr_i}{dt \rangle$. Integrating this expression with respect to time, we get: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (r_i \cdot \frac{dr_i}{dt}) \rangle$. Using the product rule for differentiation, we can rewrite this as: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (r_i^2) \rangle$. Integrating this expression with respect to time, we get: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr_i^2}{dt} \rangle$. Using the definition of the total kinetic energy, we can rewrite this as: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} (v_i^2) \rangle$. Integrating this expression with respect to time, we get: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \cdot \frac{1}{2} v_i^2 \rangle$. This is the virial theorem, which states that the time average of the virial is equal to twice the time average of the total kinetic energy of the system: $\langle \sum r \cdot F \rangle = 2 \cdot \langle K \rangle$. This formula can be used to determine the mass of galaxies by applying the virial theorem to the gravitational forces acting on the stars and gas in the galaxy. By measuring the velocity dispersion of the stars and gas, we can estimate the total kinetic energy of the system. Then, by measuring the virial, we can estimate the total gravitational potential energy of the system. Finally, by equating the total kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy, we can solve for the mass of the galaxy. This method is useful for determining the mass of galaxies that are too distant or faint to be measured directly using other methods. The virial theorem is a powerful tool in astrophysics for studying the dynamics of galaxies and other astronomical systems.

Integrating yields the energy integral:
$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + V = \varepsilon$",No," To solve this problem, we will follow these steps: 1. Write down the given dynamical equation for each body. 2. Find the total energy of the system. 3. Find the total linear momentum of the system. 4. Find the total angular momentum of the system. 5. Show that these quantities are conserved. Now, let's start solving the problem.

First, we will write down the given dynamical equation for each body: $m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$.

Next, we will find the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by: $T=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$. The potential energy is given by: $V=-\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$. Therefore, the total energy of the system is: $E=T+V=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}-\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}$. This quantity is conserved, as it does not change with time. Now, we will find the total linear momentum of the system. The total linear momentum of the system is the sum of the linear momentum of each body: $\mathbf{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$. This quantity is conserved, as it does not change with time. Finally, we will find the total angular momentum of the system. The total angular momentum of the system is the sum of the angular momentum of each body: $\mathbf{L}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$. This quantity is conserved, as it does not change with time. Therefore, we have derived the first integrals of motion for an N-body system: the total energy, the total linear momentum, and the total angular momentum. These quantities are conserved and do not change with time. This is the end of the problem-solving process. The problem is solved. The first integrals of motion for an N-body system are the total energy, the total linear momentum, and the total angular momentum. These quantities are conserved and do not change with time.",0.714

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$g\cdot2\pi dL=-4\pi G\rho\pi R^{2}L\Rightarrow\vec{g(r)}=-\frac{2\pi G\rho R^{2}}{d}\hat{r}$

According to: 

Now, knowing that $F_g=F_{cp}\Rightarrow mg=m\omega^{2}d=m(2\pi/P)^{2}d$, we can find the period.

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No," In order to solve this problem, we will use the formula for the period of a satellite around a planet. This formula is given by: $P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{d^3}}}$ where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, and $d$ is the distance from the satellite to the center of the planet. We also know that the mass of the planet can be calculated using the formula: $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\rho$ where $R$ is the radius of the planet and $\rho$ is the average density of the planet. Now, let's substitute the expression for the mass of the planet into the formula for the period of the satellite. We get: $P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{G\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3\rho\right)}{d^3}}}$ Simplifying this expression, we get: $P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}\pi G R^3\rho}}$ Now, we can further simplify this expression by taking out the common factors: $P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}\pi G R^3\rho}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}\pi G R^3}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho}$ Therefore, the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet is: $P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}\pi G R^3}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho}$ This expression shows that the period of the satellite is inversely proportional to the square root of the average density of the planet. In other words, the period of the satellite will be shorter for a denser planet and longer for a less dense planet. This makes sense because a denser planet will have a stronger gravitational pull, causing the satellite to orbit faster. Conversely, a less dense planet will have a weaker gravitational pull, causing the satellite to orbit slower. This relationship is an important concept in astronomy and is used to study the properties of planets and their satellites. It also has implications for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The formula derived in this problem is a useful tool for astronomers to analyze the behavior of satellites around planets and to make predictions about their orbits.

11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

According to: 

The velocity distribution in an elliptical galaxy is uniform and random. Then, we can use the Virial theorem ($T=-U/2$) to calculate the velocity at the edge of the galaxy.

Conclude: 

$1/2Mv_{tot}^{2}=\frac{3}{10}\frac{GM^{2}}{R}\Longrightarrow M=\frac{5}{3}\frac{v_{tot}^{2}R}{G}$

Where $v_{tot}$ is the total magnitude of the velocity (in tangential and nontangential directions). 

According to: 

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No," To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy and the formula for the radial velocity dispersion of a spherical galaxy. Let's start with the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy. The formula for the rotational velocity (v) of a spiral galaxy is given by: v = sqrt(G * M / R) where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the galaxy, and R is the radius of the galaxy. We are given that the rotational velocity of Galaxy A is equal to v, so we can set up the equation: v = sqrt(G * M_A / R) Now, we need to find the mass (M_A) of Galaxy A. To do this, we can rearrange the equation to solve for M_A: M_A = (v^2 * R) / G Next, let's consider the radial velocity dispersion of a spherical galaxy. The formula for the radial velocity dispersion (σ) of a spherical galaxy is given by: σ = sqrt((G * M) / (3 * R)) where M is the mass of the galaxy and R is the radius of the galaxy. We are given that the radial velocity dispersion of Galaxy B is equal to v, so we can set up the equation: v = sqrt((G * M_B) / (3 * R)) Now, we need to find the mass (M_B) of Galaxy B. To do this, we can rearrange the equation to solve for M_B: M_B = (3 * v^2 * R) / G Finally, we can compare the masses of both galaxies. Since we have found the masses of both galaxies using the same radius (R) and the same rotational velocity (v) for Galaxy A and the same radial velocity dispersion (v) for Galaxy B, we can conclude that the masses of both galaxies are equal. Therefore, M_A = M_B. So, the masses of both galaxies are equal, and we can use either of the equations to find the mass of either galaxy. For example, if we want to find the mass of Galaxy A, we can use the equation: M_A = (v^2 * R) / G And if we want to find the mass of Galaxy B, we can use the equation: M_B = (3 * v^2 * R) / G. Both equations will give us the same result, which is the mass of the galaxy. In conclusion, the masses of both galaxies are equal, and we can use either of the equations to find the mass of either galaxy.",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,".

To solve this problem, we need to find the density of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants. Let's start by expressing the number density of electrons in the star in terms of the mass of the star. The number of electrons in the star is equal to the number of protons, which is equal to the number of nuclei. The mass of the star is the sum of the mass of the nuclei and the mass of the electrons. Therefore, the number density of electrons can be expressed as:

$n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{N}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3m_n}$

where $m_n$ is the mass of a nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is given by:

$m_n = Am_u$

where $A$ is the mass number and $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit. The mass of the star is the sum of the mass of the nuclei and the mass of the electrons. Therefore, the mass of the star can be expressed as:

$M = NM + Nm_e$

where $m_e$ is the mass of an electron. Substituting the expression for the mass of the star into the expression for the number density of electrons, we get:

$n = \frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{4\pi R^3m_n}$

Now, we can substitute this expression for the number density of electrons into the formula for the electron degeneracy pressure:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

Substituting the expression for the number density of electrons, we get:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{4\pi R^3m_n}\right)^{5/3}$

Now, we can equate the electron degeneracy pressure to the gravitational pressure:

$pelectron = p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

Substituting the expression for the gravitational pressure, we get:

$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{4\pi R^3m_n}\right)^{5/3} = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

Now, we can solve for the density of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants. The density of the white dwarf is given by:

$\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$

Substituting the expression for the mass of the star, we get:

$\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3m_n} = \frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{4\pi R^3m_n}$

Now, we can substitute the expression for the radius of the star in terms of the mass of the star:

$R = \left(\frac{3GM^2}{4\pi m_n}\right)^{1/3}$

Substituting this expression for the radius of the star, we get:

$\rho = \frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{4\pi \left(\frac{3GM^2}{4\pi m_n}\right)^{1/3}m_n} = \frac{3(M - Nm_e)}{3^{1/3}\pi^{1/3}G^{1/3}M^{2/3}m_n^{4/3}$

Now, we can substitute the expression for the mass of a nucleus in terms of the atomic number and mass number:

$m_n = Am_u$

Substituting this expression for the mass of a nucleus, we get:

$\rho = \frac{3(M - NAm_u)}{3^{1/3}\pi^{1/3}G^{1/3}M^{2/3}(Am_u)^{4/3}$

Now, we can substitute the expression for the number of nuclei in terms of the atomic number and mass number:

$N = ZA$

Substituting this expression for the number of nuclei, we get:

$\rho = \frac{3(M - ZA^2m_u)}{3^{1/3}\pi^{1/3}G^{1/3}M^{2/3}(A^2m_u)^{4/3}$

Now, we can simplify the expression for the density of the white dwarf:

$\rho = \frac{3(M - ZA^2m_u)}{3^{1/3}\pi^{1/3}G^{1/3}M^{2/3}A^4m_u^{4/3}$

This is the expression for the density of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

Conclude: 

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{B}(\vec{m}_2) = -\vec{m}_1 \cdot \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2}{r^3} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2}{r^3}$",No," 

To solve this problem, we will first need to find the magnetic field created by dipole 1 at the location of dipole 2, and then use the potential energy formula to find the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$. Let's start by finding the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ created by dipole 1 at the location of dipole 2. Using the formula for the magnetic field of a perfect magnetic dipole, we have

$\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}}{r^3}$

Now, we need to find the potential energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between the two magnetic dipoles. Using the formula for the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field, we have

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$

Substituting the expression for $\vec{B}_1$ into this equation, we get

$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}}{r^3} \right)$

Now, we can simplify this expression by taking the dot product of $\vec{m}_2$ with the expression inside the parentheses. This gives us

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2)(\hat{r} \cdot \hat{r)} - (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2)}{r^3}$

Since $\hat{r} \cdot \hat{r} = 1$, we can simplify this expression further to get

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2) - (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2)}{r^3}$

Finally, we can combine the two terms in the numerator to get

$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2)}{r^3}$

This is the energy of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. 

The final answer is: $U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2)}{r^3}$

This equation describes the energy of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The energy is proportional to the product of the magnetic moments of the two dipoles and inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between them. The negative sign indicates that the interaction is attractive. This equation is a fundamental result in the study of magnetic interactions and has many applications in physics and engineering.",0.49

the kinetic energy

Conclude: 

$K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2}.$

According to: 

Since the Coulomb force keeps the electron in a centripetal orbit。

$\frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}.$

Conclude: 

$E_{\text{Total}} = V + K = -\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} + \frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r} = -\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r}.$

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No," Here is the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the key components. We have an electron with mass $m_{e}$ orbiting a proton with mass $m_{p}$ at a radius $r$. The only force acting on the electron is the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the proton. We need to write expressions for the total energy and the orbital momentum of the electron.

Step 2: Write the expression for the Coulombic potential energy. The Coulombic potential energy between two charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by $V = \frac{q_{1}q_{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}$. In this case, the charges are the electron and the proton, with charges $-e$ and $+e$, respectively. The distance between them is the radius of the orbit, $r$. Therefore, the Coulombic potential energy is $V = \frac{-e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}$.

Step 3: Write the expression for the kinetic energy of the electron. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by $K = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the electron. To find the velocity, we can use the centripetal force equation, $F = \frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r$. Since the only force acting on the electron is the Coulombic attraction, we can set this equal to the Coulombic force, $F = \frac{e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}$. Solving for $v$, we get $v = \sqrt{\frac{e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}m_{e}}$.

Step 4: Write the expression for the total energy of the electron. The total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies, $E = K + V$. Substituting the expressions for $K$ and $V$ from steps 2 and 3, we get $E = \frac{1}{2}m_{e}\sqrt{\frac{e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}m_{e}} + \frac{-e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$.

Step 5: Write the expression for the orbital momentum of the electron. The orbital momentum of the electron is given by $L = m_{e}vr$. Substituting the expression for $v$ from step 3, we get $L = m_{e}\sqrt{\frac{e^{2}{r^{2}}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}m_{e}}r$.

And that's the solution! We have written expressions for the total energy and the orbital momentum of the electron in terms of its mass, the electric charge, the radius of the orbit, and the permittivity of free space. These expressions can be used to describe the behavior of the electron in its orbit around the proton.",0.637

For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No," 

To solve this problem, we will use the conservation of energy and momentum. We will first find the speed of the meteorite just before the collision, then the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate, and finally the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth. We will also find the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the scenario is possible.

Let's start with the speed of the meteorite just before the collision. The meteorite is radially approaching the Earth, so its speed is given by:

v1 = sqrt(2GM/R)

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the orbit of the space station.

Now, let's find the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate. After the collision, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. The minimum speed of the conglomerate is given by:

v_min = sqrt(2GM/(R/2))

The maximum speed of the conglomerate occurs at the maximum distance from the center of the Earth, which is R. The maximum speed is given by:

v_max = sqrt(2GM/R)

Now, let's find the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth. The maximum distance is equal to R, which is the radius of the orbit of the space station.

Finally, let's find the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the scenario is possible. The condition is that the total mass of the meteorite and the space station must be less than the mass of the Earth, i.e., m1 + m2 < M. This is because if the total mass of the meteorite and the space station is greater than the mass of the Earth, the conglomerate will not be able to move in a closed orbit around the Earth. 

So, the problem-solving process is as follows:

1. Find the speed of the meteorite just before the collision: v1 = sqrt(2GM/R)
2. Find the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate: v_min = sqrt(2GM/(R/2) and v_max = sqrt(2GM/R)
3. Find the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth: R
4. Find the condition that m1 and m2 must obey: m1 + m2 < M

The final answer is:

The speed of the meteorite just before the collision is v1 = sqrt(2GM/R). The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate are v_min = sqrt(2GM/(R/2) and v_max = sqrt(2GM/R). The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth is R. The condition that m1 and m2 must obey is m1 + m2 < M. 

This answer is expressed in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass m1 of the meteorite, and the mass m2 of the space station.

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

To show that the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, we can use the definition of surface magnitude and the inverse square law for light intensity. The surface magnitude of a galaxy is defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. Let's denote the surface magnitude as $m_{surf}$, the apparent magnitude as $m$, the solid angle of the galaxy as $\Omega$, and the distance to the galaxy as $D$. The inverse square law for light intensity states that the intensity of light received from a source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Mathematically, this can be written as: $I \propto \frac{1}{D^2}$. The surface magnitude is related to the apparent magnitude by the formula: $m_{surf} = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(\Omega)$. We can use the inverse square law to relate the apparent magnitude to the surface magnitude. The apparent magnitude is the magnitude of a star or galaxy as seen from Earth, and it is affected by the distance to the object. The surface magnitude, on the other hand, is independent of the distance to the galaxy. To show this, we can rewrite the inverse square law in terms of the apparent magnitude: $m = -2.5 \log_{10}(I) + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Substituting this expression for $m$ into the formula for surface magnitude, we get: $m_{surf} = -2.5 \log_{10}(I) + C + 2.5 \log_{10}(\Omega)$. Since the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy, we can see that the term $-2.5 \log_{10}(I)$ is independent of $D$. Therefore, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe. This is because the surface magnitude is defined in terms of the solid angle of the galaxy, which is independent of the distance to the galaxy. The apparent magnitude, on the other hand, is affected by the distance to the galaxy, but this effect is canceled out by the logarithmic term in the formula for surface magnitude. Thus, the surface magnitude is a more useful quantity for comparing the brightness of galaxies, as it is independent of the distance to the galaxy. This is particularly useful when comparing galaxies that are at different distances from us. In conclusion, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy in a non-expanding universe, and it is a useful quantity for comparing the brightness of galaxies. This is because the surface magnitude is defined in terms of the solid angle of the galaxy, which is independent of the distance to the galaxy.

17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

To derive Kepler's laws, we need to start with Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. Mathematically, it can be represented as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the gravitational force between two masses m1 and m2, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the two masses. Now, let's consider a planet orbiting a star. The planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, so we can neglect the planet's mass and assume that the star is the only mass affecting the planet's motion. In this case, the force acting on the planet is given by F = G * (M * m) / r^2, where M is the mass of the star and m is the mass of the planet. Since the planet is in a stable orbit, the net force acting on it must be zero. This means that the gravitational force acting on the planet must be balanced by the planet's inertia, which is given by mv^2/r, where v is the planet's velocity. Setting these two forces equal to each other, we get: G * (M * m) / r^2 = mv^2/r. Simplifying this equation, we get: G * M = rv^2. Now, let's consider the planet's orbit. The planet's orbit is an ellipse, and the star is at one of the foci of the ellipse. The planet's distance from the star varies as it orbits, and the closest point in the orbit is called the perihelion, while the farthest point is called the aphelion. The semi-major axis of the ellipse is denoted by a, and the eccentricity of the ellipse is denoted by e. The distance between the planet and the star at any point in the orbit can be expressed as: r = a * (1 + e * cos(θ)), where θ is the angle between the planet's position vector and the major axis of the ellipse. Substituting this expression for r into the equation G * M = rv^2, we get: G * M = a * (1 + e * cos(θ)) * v^2. Differentiating this equation with respect to θ, we get: G * M * (-e * sin(θ)) = a * (1 + e * cos(θ)) * (2v * dv/dθ). Simplifying this equation, we get: dv/dθ = -G * M * e / (a * v * (1 + e * cos(θ)). This equation describes the rate of change of the planet's velocity as it orbits the star. Integrating this equation with respect to θ, we get: v = sqrt(G * M / a) * (1 - e^2) / (1 + e * cos(θ)). This equation describes the planet's velocity as a function of its position in the orbit. Now, let's consider the planet's orbital period, which is the time it takes for the planet to complete one orbit around the star. The orbital period can be expressed as: T = 2π * sqrt(a^3 / (G * M)). This equation is Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Now, let's consider the planet's orbital shape. Since the planet's orbit is an ellipse, the sum of the distances from the planet to the two foci of the ellipse is constant. The distance between the planet and the star at any point in the orbit is given by: r = a * (1 + e * cos(θ)). The distance between the planet and the second focus of the ellipse is given by: r2 = a * (1 - e * cos(θ)). The sum of these two distances is constant, which means that the planet's orbit is an ellipse. This is Kepler's first law of planetary motion, which states that the orbits of the planets are ellipses with the star at one of the foci. Finally, let's consider the planet's orbital speed. The planet's orbital speed is not constant, but varies as it moves around the star. The planet's velocity as a function of its position in the orbit is given by: v = sqrt(G * M / a) * (1 - e^2) / (1 + e * cos(θ)). This equation shows that the planet's velocity is not constant, but varies as it moves around the star. This is Kepler's second law of planetary motion, which states that the line connecting the planet to the star sweeps out equal areas in equal times. In conclusion, we have derived Kepler's laws based on the law of universal gravitation. Kepler's first law states that the orbits of the planets are ellipses with the star at one of the foci. Kepler's second law states that the line connecting the planet to the star sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. These laws describe the motion of planets around stars and have been confirmed by numerous observations and experiments.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No," 

Here is the problem-solving process:

To derive the expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, we need to first express the rotational velocity as a function of the distance from the Galactic Centre. Then, we can differentiate this function with respect to the distance to obtain the radial gradient.

Let's start with the first case, where the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy is considered. We can use the first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components derived by Jan Oort:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

To express the rotational velocity as a function of the distance from the Galactic Centre, we can use the relationship between the angular velocity and the rotational velocity:

$V = \Omega R$

Since the Sun is at a distance $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc from the GC, we can rewrite the rotational velocity as:

$V(R_0) = \Omega_0 R_0$

Now, we can use the line-of-sight velocity component to express the angular velocity as a function of the distance:

$V_{\mathrm{r}} = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0 \sin l$

Since the Sun is at a distance $R_0$ from the GC, we can rewrite this as:

$V_{\mathrm{r}} = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0 \sin l = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R$

Now, we can solve for the angular velocity:

$\Omega = \Omega_0 + \frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R_0 \sin l}$

Substituting this into the expression for the rotational velocity, we get:

$V(R) = \left(\Omega_0 + \frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R_0 \sin l}\right) R$

Now, we can differentiate this expression with respect to the distance to obtain the radial gradient:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{r}}}{R_0 \sin l}$

Substituting the expression for $V_{\mathrm{r}}$ from the first order approximation, we get:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{AD\sin2l}{R_0 \sin l}$

Since the Sun is at a distance $R_0$ from the GC, we can simplify this expression to:

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = \frac{AD\sin2l}{R_0 \sin l}$

Now, let's consider the second case, where the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre. In this case, the rotational velocity is given by:

$V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$

where $M$ is the total mass of the Galaxy. To obtain the radial gradient, we can differentiate this expression with respect to the distance:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{GM}{2R^2}$

Now, we can substitute the expression for the total mass of the Galaxy, which is given by:

$M = 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$

where $M_{\odot}$ is the mass of the Sun. Substituting this into the expression for the radial gradient, we get:

$\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}{\rm G}}{2R^2}$

Since the Sun is at a distance $R_0$ from the GC, we can simplify this expression to:

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot{\rm G}}}{2R_0^2}$

Therefore, the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun is given by:

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = \frac{AD\sin2l}{R_0 \sin l}$ for the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot{\rm G}}}{2R_0^2}$ for the hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.",0.728

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

To solve this problem, we need to express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$. We can start by using the given equations for the line-of-sight and transverse velocity components, and then derive expressions for $A$ and $B$ in terms of the known quantities. Let's begin by rewriting the equations for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$ in terms of the angular velocities and the distances involved. We have: $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$. Now, we can use the small-angle approximation to simplify these equations. Since $D \ll R_{0$, we can write: $\sin l \approx l$ and $\cos l \approx 1$. Substituting these approximations into the equations for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$, we get: $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} - \Omega D$. Next, we can use the fact that the angular velocity of a circular orbit is related to the rotational velocity by the equation: $\Omega = \frac{V}{R$. Substituting this equation into the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$, we get: $V_{r} = \frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} l$, $V_{t} = \frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} - \frac{D}{R}$. Now, we can use the definition of Oort's constants to express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$. We have: $A = \frac{1}{2R_{0}\sin 2l}\left(V_{r} + V_{t}\right)$, $B = \frac{1}{2R_{0}\sin 2l}\left(V_{t} - V_{r}\right)$. Substituting the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{t}$ into these equations, we get: $A = \frac{1}{2R_{0}\sin 2l}\left[\left(\frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} l}\right) + \left(\frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} - \frac{D}{R}\right)\right]$, $B = \frac{1}{2R_{0}\sin 2l}\left[\left(\frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} - \frac{D}{R}\right) - \left(\frac{V - V_{0}}{R_{0} l}\right)\right]$. Now, we can simplify these expressions by using the small-angle approximation and the fact that $D \ll R_{0}$. We get: $A = \frac{V - V_{0}}{2R_{0} l}$, $B = \frac{V - V_{0}}{2R_{0} - D}$. Finally, we can express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$. We have: $A = \frac{V_{0}}{2R_{0} l}\left(1 + \frac{R_{0}}{V_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right)$, $B = \frac{V_{0}}{2R_{0}\left(1 + \frac{R_{0}}{V_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right)}$.

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,".

Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

The problem describes an accretion disc around a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole. The gas in the disc follows a Keplerian orbit, and we need to find the total mechanical energy released as the gas moves from the maximum radius $R_{max}$ to a much smaller radius r. The energy is released through viscous dissipation, transforming kinetic energy into internal energy of the gas.

Step 2: Calculating the Initial Energy

The initial energy of the gas at $R_{max}$ is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[ E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \]

where m is the mass of the gas and v is its velocity. The potential energy is given by:

\[ E_p = - \frac{GMm}{R_{max} + R} \]

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the compact object, and R is its radius. The total initial energy is:

\[ E_{initial} = E_k + E_p \]

Step 3: Calculating the Final Energy

The final energy of the gas at radius r is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[ E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \]

where m is the mass of the gas and v is its velocity. The potential energy is given by:

\[ E_p = - \frac{GMm}{r + R} \]

The total final energy is:

\[ E_{final} = E_k + E_p \]

Step 4: Calculating the Energy Released

The energy released is the difference between the initial and final energies:

\[ \Delta E = E_{initial} - E_{final} \]

Substituting the expressions for the initial and final energies, we get:

\[ \Delta E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{GMm}{R_{max} + R} - \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r + R} \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ \Delta E = \frac{GMm}{R_{max} + R} - \frac{GMm}{r + R} \]

Step 5: Calculating the Energy Released per Unit Mass

To find the energy released per unit mass, we divide the total energy released by the mass of the gas:

\[ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{R_{max} + R} - \frac{GM}{r + R} \]

Step 6: Simplifying the Expression

Since $R_{min}/R_{max}\ll1$, we can approximate $R_{max} + R \approx R_{max}$ and $r + R \approx r$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{R_{max} - r} \]

This is the final expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas as it moves from $R_{max}$ to r. The expression is given in terms of G, M, and r.",0.728

To solve this problem, we need to derive an expression for the Hubble constant $(H_0)$ using the given information. Let's break down the problem into smaller steps. 

1. First, we need to understand the setup of the experiment. A large, fully reflecting flat mirror is placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. A laser beam is directed towards the mirror for a long period of time, and after a time $T$, the radiation returns and is detected. 

2. The separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe. We can use the law $S=se^{H_{0}t$ to describe this relationship, where $s$ is the initial separation and $t$ is the time. 

3. We are given that the separation $S$ increases only due to the expansion of the universe, so we can assume that the distance $D$ is equal to the initial separation $s$. 

4. The time $T$ is the time it takes for the laser beam to travel to the mirror and return to the Solar System. We can use the speed of light $c$ to calculate this time: $T=\frac{2D}{c}$. 

5. Now, we can use the law $S=se^{H_{0}t$ to find an expression for $H_0$. We know that $S=2D$ (since the distance to the mirror and back is twice the distance to the mirror), so we can write: $2D=se^{H_{0}T$. 

6. Substituting the expression for $T$ into the equation, we get: $2D=se^{H_{0}\frac{2D}{c}$. 

7. Simplifying the equation, we get: $2D=se^{\frac{2DH_{0}}{c}$. 

8. Dividing both sides by $2D$, we get: $1=e^{\frac{2DH_{0}}{c}$. 

9. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: $\ln(1)=\frac{2DH_{0}}{c}$. 

10. Simplifying the equation, we get: $0=\frac{2DH_{0}}{c}$. 

11. Multiplying both sides by $c/2D$, we get: $H_{0}=0$. 

So, the expression for the Hubble constant $(H_0)$ is: $H_{0}=0$. This result is expected, as the Hubble constant is a measure of the expansion rate of the universe, and in a Steady-State-Universe, the expansion rate is constant. Therefore, the Hubble constant is zero in this model. 

In conclusion, the expression for the Hubble constant $(H_0)$ as a function of $D$, $c$, and $T$ is: $H_{0}=0$. This result is consistent with the Steady-State-Universe model, where the expansion rate of the universe is constant.

Therefore, the expression for $L_{GW}$ is: $L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5}\frac{G^4}{c^5}\frac{M^2}{R^5}$. This expression is consistent with the given value of the dimensionless constant from general relativity, which is $\frac{2}{5}$.

27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No," 

Let's break down this problem and solve it step by step. First, we need to understand the given expression for the gravitational wave luminosity, which is $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$. This expression tells us how much energy is being radiated away by the gravitational waves. Next, we need to find the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, which is $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$. To do this, we can use the hint provided, which is $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1 \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$. Applying this to the given expression, we can rewrite it as $\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$. Now, we can use the chain rule to find the rate of change of the radius $R$ with respect to time. We have $\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}R} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$. Substituting the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}R$, we get $\frac{\mathrm{d}L_{GW}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{10G^4 M^5}{5R^6 c^5} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$. Now, we can solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t$ by rearranging the equation. We have $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{R^6 c^5}$. This is the expression for the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time. It tells us how fast the radius of the orbit is decreasing due to the emission of gravitational waves. The negative sign indicates that the radius is decreasing over time. The rate of change is proportional to the fifth power of the mass $M$ and inversely proportional to the sixth power of the radius $R$. This makes sense, as more massive stars will radiate more energy and lose their orbital radius faster, while stars with a larger orbital radius will lose their radius more slowly. In summary, the expression for the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time is $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{R^6 c^5}$. This expression can be used to study the evolution of binary neutron star systems and the effects of gravitational wave emission on their orbits.",0.49
