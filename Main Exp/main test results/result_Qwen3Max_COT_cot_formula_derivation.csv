2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"To derive the **virial theorem** based on **Newton’s second law**, we proceed step by step, starting from basic mechanics and building toward the time-averaged relation that defines the virial theorem.

---

### **Step 1: Define the quantity of interest — the scalar virial**

We are given a system of many particles (e.g., molecules or stars). For each particle \( i \), let:

- \( \mathbf{r}_i \): position vector,
- \( \mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i \): linear momentum,
- \( \mathbf{F}_i \): total force acting on particle \( i \).

The **virial** is defined as:
\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
\]
This quantity \( G \) is sometimes called the **""virial function""** or **""G-function""**. Its time derivative will lead us to the virial theorem.

> **Note**: The problem mentions \( \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \) as the virial, but historically and in modern derivations, the virial theorem arises from considering the time derivative of \( \sum \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r} \). The term \( \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \) appears in the final result. We'll clarify this below.

---

### **Step 2: Take the time derivative of \( G \)**

Compute \( \frac{dG}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right)
= \sum_i m_i \left( \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right)
= \sum_i m_i \left( \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right)
\]

Since \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{v}_i \), and \( \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{a}_i \).

So:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \sum_i m_i v_i^2
\]

Now apply **Newton’s second law**: \( m_i \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{F}_i \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \sum_i m_i v_i^2
\]

Recognize that:

- \( \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2K \), where \( K \) is the total kinetic energy (since \( K = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i v_i^2 \)),
- \( \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \) is the **virial** as defined in the problem statement.

Thus:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2K + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

---

### **Step 3: Time-average both sides**

For a **bound, stable system** (like a galaxy or a gas in equilibrium), the motion is confined and does not diverge with time. Therefore, the quantity \( G = \sum \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \) remains **bounded** over time.

As a result, its long-term time average of the derivative vanishes:
\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0
\]
where \( \langle \cdot \rangle \) denotes a time average over a sufficiently long interval (or over one period for periodic systems).

Therefore:
\[
0 = \left\langle 2K + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle
\]

Rearranging:
\[
2 \langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

This is the **general form of the virial theorem**.

---

### **Step 4: Specialize to conservative forces (e.g., gravity)**

In most astrophysical contexts (like galaxies), the forces are **conservative** and derived from a potential \( U \), so \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), where \( \nabla_i \) acts on coordinates of particle \( i \).

For gravitational systems, the potential energy \( U \) is a homogeneous function of degree \( -1 \) in the coordinates (since \( U \propto 1/r \)).

Using **Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions**, one can show:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U
\]
where \( k \) is the degree of homogeneity. For gravity, \( k = -1 \), so:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -U
\Rightarrow \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = U
\]

Wait! Let's be careful:

Since \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), then:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -k U
\]

For gravitational potential energy, which scales as \( U(\lambda \mathbf{r}) = \lambda^{-1} U(\mathbf{r}) \), so \( k = -1 \), thus:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -(-1) U = -U
\]

Actually, standard result: for inverse-square forces (gravity or electrostatics),
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
\]
where \( U \) is the total potential energy (which is negative for bound gravitational systems).

Therefore, the virial theorem becomes:
\[
2 \langle K \rangle - \langle U \rangle = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \langle K \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\]

Or more commonly written as:
\[
2K + U = 0 \quad \text{(for time-averaged equilibrium)}
\]

---

### **Final Answer: Virial Theorem Formula**

Starting from Newton’s second law and defining \( G = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \), we find:

\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2K + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

For a **bound, steady-state system**, the time average of \( dG/dt \) is zero, leading to the **virial theorem**:

\[
\boxed{2 \langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0}
\]

In the case of **gravitational systems**, where the potential energy \( U \) satisfies \( \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U \), this simplifies to:

\[
\boxed{2 \langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \langle K \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle}
\]

This is the form widely used in astrophysics to estimate masses of galaxies and clusters: by measuring kinetic energy (via velocity dispersion), one infers the potential energy and hence the total mass.",0.546

Integrating yields the energy integral:

$$

Our goal is to **derive the first integrals of motion**, i.e., conserved quantities (constants of motion) that follow directly from the symmetries or structure of the equations.

In classical mechanics, **first integrals** correspond to quantities that remain constant along the trajectories of the system. For an isolated N-body system under Newtonian gravity, there are **10 classical first integrals** due to the symmetries of space and time (via Noether’s theorem):

- **Energy** (1 integral)
- **Linear momentum** (3 components)
- **Angular momentum** (3 components)
- **Center-of-mass motion** (3 components)

We will derive each of these step by step from the given equations.

### Step 1: Total Linear Momentum Conservation

Define the **total linear momentum**:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Take its time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
$$

Swap the order of summation:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathatrix{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that the double sum includes every pair $(i,j)$ with $i \ne j$. Consider swapping indices in the term with $(j,i)$:

- The term for $(i,j)$ is: $\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$,
- The term for $(j,i)$ is: $\frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$,

since $r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = r_{ji}$.

Thus, the two terms cancel pairwise. Therefore:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **Conservation of total linear momentum** — 3 first integrals (one for each spatial component).

---

### Step 2: Conservation of Angular Momentum

Define the **total angular momentum**:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

Take time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

The first term vanishes because $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0$. So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

Factor out constants:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \ne i}} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that $\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i = 0$, so this becomes:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \ne i}} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

Now consider the double sum over all $i \ne j$. Again, pair terms $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$:

- Term $(i,j)$: $ \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $
- Term $(j,i)$: $ \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $

So they cancel. Hence:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **Conservation of total angular momentum** — 3 first integrals.

---

### Step 3: Conservation of Total Energy

The **total mechanical energy** is kinetic plus potential:

- Kinetic energy: $ T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 $
- Gravitational potential energy:  
  $$
  U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
  $$
  (The factor $1/2$ avoids double-counting pairs.)

Total energy: $ E = T + U $.

Take time derivative:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \frac{dU}{dt}.
$$

Compute $ \frac{dU}{dt} $. Since $ U $ depends only on positions:

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i,
$$
where $ \nabla_i U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} $.

From the expression for $U$, we find:

$$
\nabla_i U = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

But this is exactly the force on particle $i$: $ \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \nabla_i U $.

Wait! Actually, **force is negative gradient of potential**: $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $. Let's check sign:

Given:
$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So define potential such that:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \Rightarrow \nabla_i U = \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Therefore,
$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_i \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_i \left( \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

Then total derivative of energy:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_i \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_i (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \nabla_i U) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

But since $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\nabla_i U $, the sum is zero:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **Conservation of total energy** — 1 first integral.

---

### Step 4: Center-of-Mass Motion (Uniform Motion of CM)

Define the **center of mass**:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad \text{where } M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i.
$$

Take second derivative:

$$
M \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0,
$$

from Step 1. Therefore:

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \mathbf{V}_0 = \text{constant}, \quad \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t.
$$

This implies that the center of mass moves with **uniform velocity**. While $\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t)$ itself is not constant, its **velocity** is. However, the **initial position and velocity of the CM** provide **6 constants** (3 for initial position, 3 for velocity), but only **3 independent first integrals** arise from $\dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \text{const}$, because the constancy of $\mathbf{P}$ already accounts for 3 integrals.

However, in the standard count of first integrals for the N-body problem, the **uniform motion of the center of mass** provides **3 additional integrals** beyond linear momentum? Wait—actually, **linear momentum conservation already gives the constancy of $\mathbf{P} = M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}}$**, so the 3 components of $\mathbf{P}$ are the same as saying the CM moves uniformly.

But there's another set: integrating $\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0$ gives:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{M} t.
$$

If we rearrange:

$$
\mathbf{K} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{P} t = M \mathbf{R}_0 = \text{constant vector}.
$$

This vector $\mathbf{K}$ is conserved! It's called the **center-of-mass integral** or **Galilean invariance integral**.

Let’s verify:

Define:
$$
\mathbf{K} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{P} t.
$$

Then:
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{K}}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{P}} t - \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P} - 0 - \mathbf{P} = 0.
$$

So $\mathbf{K}$ is conserved. This gives **3 more first integrals**.

These are independent of energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum.

✅ **Conservation of center-of-mass motion** — 3 first integrals (components of $\mathbf{K}$).

> Note: Some texts count linear momentum (3) and CM position at $t=0$ (3) as separate, totaling 6, but only 3 of these are functionally independent from the others in the context of first integrals derived from equations of motion. However, in the classical Newtonian N-body problem, it is standard to say there are **10** independent first integrals:  
> - 1 energy  
> - 3 linear momentum  
> - 3 angular momentum  
> - 3 center-of-mass (or ""boost"") integrals  

These correspond to the 10 generators of the Galilean group (time translation, spatial translations, rotations, and Galilean boosts).

---

### Final Summary: First Integrals of Motion

From the N-body equations:

1. **Energy Conservation**:
   $$
   E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{const.}
   $$

2. **Linear Momentum Conservation**:
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const.}
   $$

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const.}
   $$

4. **Center-of-Mass Motion (Galilean Boost)**:
   $$
   \mathbf{K} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{P} t = \text{const.}
   $$

These give **10 scalar first integrals** in total.

---

### Conclusion

By analyzing the symmetries and structure of the Newtonian N-body equations, we have derived the **10 classical first integrals of motion**:

- 1 from time-translation invariance → energy,
- 3 from spatial-translation invariance → linear momentum,
- 3 from rotational invariance → angular momentum,
- 3 from Galilean boost invariance → uniform motion of center of mass.

These are the fundamental conserved quantities of the isolated Newtonian N-body problem.",0.714

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"To prove the expressions for the velocities at **aphelion** and **perihelion** for a celestial body in **elliptical orbit**, we will use fundamental principles of orbital mechanics:

- Conservation of **angular momentum**
- Conservation of **mechanical energy**
- Geometry of the **ellipse**

---

### Step 1: Definitions and Notation

Let:
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ (standard gravitational parameter; for planets around the Sun, $ m \ll M $, so $ \mu \approx GM $)
- $ a $: semi-major axis of the ellipse
- $ e $: eccentricity ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipse)
- $ r_P $: distance at **perihelion** (closest point to focus)
- $ r_A $: distance at **aphelion** (farthest point from focus)
- $ v_P $: speed at perihelion
- $ v_A $: speed at aphelion

From geometry of ellipse with the central body at one focus:
$$
r_P = a(1 - e), \quad r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Conservation of Angular Momentum

In central-force motion (like gravity), angular momentum is conserved. At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity vector is **perpendicular** to the radius vector (since these are turning points in radial distance), so the specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass) is:

$$
h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$

Thus,
$$
a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_P = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} v_A \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Conservation of Mechanical Energy

The specific mechanical energy (energy per unit mass) in a Keplerian orbit is constant and given by:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a} \tag{2}
$$

This holds **at any point** in the orbit, including at perihelion and aphelion.

Apply this at **perihelion**:

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Substitute $ r_P = a(1 - e) $:

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{2a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1}{1 - e} - \frac{1}{2} \right)
$$

Compute the expression in parentheses:

$$
\frac{1}{1 - e} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{2(1 - e)} = \frac{1 + e}{2(1 - e)}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{2(1 - e)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

Therefore,

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $ v_P $.

---

### Step 4: Derive $ v_A $ Similarly (or use angular momentum relation)

We can either repeat the energy calculation at aphelion, or use Equation (1).

Let’s use energy at **aphelion** to verify:

$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}, \quad r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a} = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1}{1 + e} - \frac{1}{2} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{2(1 + e)} = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{2(1 + e)}
$$

So,

$$
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $ v_A $.

---

### Step 5: Cross-check with Angular Momentum (Optional Consistency Check)

From earlier: $ v_P = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} v_A $

Now plug in our expressions:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }, \quad v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{ \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } }{ \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } } = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

Which matches Equation (1). ✔️ Consistent.

---

### Final Answer

We have proven that for a celestial body in elliptical orbit around a central mass:

$$
\boxed{
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }, \quad
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
}
$$

These follow directly from:
- The geometric properties of ellipses ($ r_P = a(1 - e), r_A = a(1 + e) $)
- Conservation of energy (vis-viva equation)
- Conservation of angular momentum

This completes the proof.",0.546
10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"We are given a **very long cylindrical planet** with:

- Average density: $\rho$
- Radius: $R$
- A satellite orbiting at distance $d$ from the **center** of the cylinder (so $d > R$, since it's outside the planet)

We are to find the **orbital period** $P$ of the satellite as a function of $d$, $\rho$, and $R$.

---

### Step 1: Understand the gravitational field of an infinite cylinder

Because the planet is **very long**, we can model it as an **infinitely long uniform cylinder** of radius $R$ and volume mass density $\rho$. In such a case, the gravitational field outside the cylinder is **not** like that of a point mass (which falls off as $1/r^2$), but instead falls off as $1/r$, due to the symmetry and infinite extent.

We will use **Gauss’s law for gravity**, which in integral form is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

For an infinite cylinder, we choose a **cylindrical Gaussian surface** of radius $r$ (distance from axis) and length $L$, coaxial with the mass distribution.

Due to symmetry:
- The gravitational field $\vec{g}$ points radially inward.
- Its magnitude $g(r)$ is constant on the curved surface of the Gaussian cylinder.
- There is no flux through the end caps (field is radial, area vector is axial there).

So the left-hand side becomes:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = g(r) \cdot (2\pi r L)
$$

Now compute the enclosed mass $M_{\text{enc}}$:

- If $r \geq R$ (outside the planet), then the enclosed mass is the mass of the cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$:

$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)
$$

Apply Gauss’s law:

$$
g(r) \cdot (2\pi r L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

Wait! Hold on — check units. Actually, **Gauss’s law for gravity** is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

But note: In SI units, Gauss’s law for gravity is actually:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} \quad \text{(in cgs units)}
$$

In **SI units**, it's:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} \quad \text{still valid if using Newtonian gravity}
$$

But actually, more commonly in SI:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -4\pi G \rho \quad \Rightarrow \quad \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Yes, this is correct in both systems as long as $G$ is the gravitational constant.

So continue:

$$
g(r) (2\pi r L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

Wait—this has an extra $\pi$! Let's recompute $M_{\text{enc}}$:

- Volume of cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$: $V = \pi R^2 L$
- So $M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot \pi R^2 L$

Then:

$$
g(r) (2\pi r L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L) \quad \text{?}
$$

But that gives $g(r) = -\frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2}{2 r} = -\frac{2\pi^2 G \rho R^2}{r}$, which seems off.

Hold on — I think the issue is that **Gauss’s law for gravity in SI units is actually**:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} \quad \text{(cgs)}
$$
$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} \quad \text{is not standard in SI}
$$

Actually, in **SI units**, Gauss’s law for gravity is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} \quad \text{is still okay as a Newtonian formulation}
$$

But more precisely, the differential form is:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -4\pi G \rho
$$

So integrating over volume:

$$
\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{g} \, dV = -4\pi G \int_V \rho \, dV \Rightarrow \oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

So that is correct.

But now, double-check the algebra:

Left side: $g(r) \cdot (2\pi r L)$

Right side: $-4\pi G (\rho \cdot \pi R^2 L) = -4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L$

Then:

$$
g(r) = -\frac{4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L}{2\pi r L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{r}
$$

Ah! Because one $\pi$ cancels: $4\pi^2 / (2\pi) = 2\pi$

So:

$$
g(r) = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{r}
$$

That makes more sense. So the **magnitude** of gravitational acceleration at distance $r \geq R$ is:

$$
g(r) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{r}
$$

(Directed radially inward; we’ll use magnitude for centripetal force.)

---

### Step 2: Apply circular motion condition

Assume the satellite is in a **circular orbit** around the cylinder, in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis (the only stable possibility due to symmetry). Then the gravitational force provides the necessary **centripetal acceleration**.

Let the satellite have mass $m$. Then:

$$
m \cdot a_c = m \cdot \frac{v^2}{d} = F_g = m \cdot g(d) = m \cdot \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Cancel $m$:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\Rightarrow v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital **speed** is **independent of distance** $d$ (as long as $d > R$)! This is a known result for infinite line masses: orbital speed is constant with radius (analogous to flat rotation curves in galaxies).

---

### Step 3: Relate speed to orbital period

The orbital period $P$ is the time to complete a circle of circumference $2\pi d$:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

We have $v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}$, so:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho} \cdot R}
$$

Simplify:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}
= \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}
$$

Check simplification:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \sqrt{2\pi}}? Wait, better:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? No.

Actually:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? Not helpful.

Compute:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? Still messy.

Better: write

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? No.

Let me do:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? This is going nowhere.

Just simplify algebraically:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? No.

Actually:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Wait, that would imply $2\pi = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} = 2\pi$, yes!

So:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Is that true?

Check numerically: $2\pi \approx 6.283$, $\sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.283} \approx 2.506$

But $6.283 / 2.506 \approx 2.506$, yes! So indeed:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Because $\frac{a}{\sqrt{a}} = \sqrt{a}$ for $a > 0$.

So:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho} R} = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi} d}{\sqrt{G \rho} R} = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}
$$

✅ Correct.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}}
$$

This is the relation between the orbital period $P$ and the orbital distance $d$ from the center of a very long cylindrical planet of radius $R$ and uniform density $\rho$.

### Key Observations:
- Unlike Keplerian orbits ($P^2 \propto d^3$), here $P \propto d$.
- This linear dependence is characteristic of gravitational fields produced by **infinite line masses**.
- The result assumes the cylinder is **infinitely long** (or sufficiently long that edge effects are negligible) and the orbit is **circular and perpendicular** to the cylinder axis.",0.637
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Meanwhile, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. However, galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars. Calculate the masses of both galaxies.","According to: 

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

Conclude: 

$mv^{2}/R=GMm/R^{2}\Longrightarrow M=v^{2}R/G$

According to: 

The velocity distribution in an elliptical galaxy is uniform and random. Then, we can use the Virial theorem ($T=-U/2$) to calculate the velocity at the edge of the galaxy.

Conclude: 

$1/2Mv_{tot}^{2}=\frac{3}{10}\frac{GM^{2}}{R}\Longrightarrow M=\frac{5}{3}\frac{v_{tot}^{2}R}{G}$

Where $v_{tot}$ is the total magnitude of the velocity (in tangential and nontangential directions). 

According to: 

We also note that $v_{tot}^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}=3v_{r}^{2}$ (from the assumption that velocities are randomly distributed). 

Conclude: 

$M=\frac{5}{G}v^{2}R/G$.",No,"We are given two galaxies, A and B, both with radius $ R $. We're told:

- Galaxy A is a **spiral galaxy**, and at radius $ R $, its **rotational velocity** is $ v $.
- Galaxy B is a **spherical elliptical galaxy**, composed of **uniform, evenly-spaced stars**, and at radius $ R $, its **radial velocity dispersion** is $ v $.

We are to **calculate the masses** of both galaxies.

---

### Step 1: Mass of Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)

For spiral galaxies, mass can be estimated using **circular rotation curves**. Assuming that the mass is concentrated within radius $ R $, and that the rotational velocity at radius $ R $ is due to the gravitational pull of the enclosed mass, we use the **centripetal force = gravitational force** relation:

$$
\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M_A}{R^2}
$$

Solving for $ M_A $:

$$
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
$$

This is the standard formula used in rotation curve analysis.

✅ **Mass of Galaxy A**:  
$$
\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
$$

---

### Step 2: Mass of Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)

Galaxy B is **spherical**, **elliptical**, and made of **uniform, evenly-spaced stars** — this suggests we can model it as a **uniform density sphere**.

In pressure-supported systems like elliptical galaxies, we use the **virial theorem** or the **Jeans equation** to relate velocity dispersion to mass.

For a **spherical, isotropic system** in equilibrium, a commonly used form of the virial theorem gives:

$$
M \sim \frac{k \sigma^2 R}{G}
$$

where:
- $ \sigma $ is the **velocity dispersion**,
- $ R $ is a characteristic radius (e.g., half-mass radius or total radius),
- $ k $ is a structural constant that depends on the density profile.

However, since Galaxy B is specified to have **uniform density** (because stars are ""uniform, evenly-spaced""), we can compute the exact form using the **spherical Jeans equation** under the assumption of **isotropy** and **constant density**.

---

#### Step 2a: Use the Jeans Equation for Constant Density Sphere

The **spherical Jeans equation** in equilibrium (no streaming motion) is:

$$
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} + \frac{2\beta}{r} \rho \sigma_r^2 = -\rho \frac{GM(r)}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- $ \rho $ is the stellar density,
- $ \sigma_r $ is the radial velocity dispersion,
- $ \beta = 1 - \frac{\sigma_t^2}{2\sigma_r^2} $ is the anisotropy parameter,
- For **isotropic** orbits, $ \beta = 0 $, so $ \sigma_t = \sigma_r $.

Given the problem states **radial velocity dispersion = v**, and doesn't mention anisotropy, we assume **isotropic velocity distribution**, so $ \beta = 0 $.

Also, **uniform density** means:
$$
\rho(r) = \rho_0 = \text{constant for } r \leq R, \quad \text{and } 0 \text{ for } r > R
$$
Then the enclosed mass is:
$$
M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho_0 \quad \text{for } r \leq R
$$
and total mass:
$$
M_B = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho_0
$$

Now apply the Jeans equation with $ \beta = 0 $, and $ \rho = \rho_0 = $ const:

$$
\frac{d(\rho_0 \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho_0 \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
$$

Since $ \rho_0 $ is constant, we can divide both sides by $ \rho_0 $:

$$
\frac{d(\sigma_r^2)}{dr} = - \frac{G M(r)}{r^2} = - \frac{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho_0}{r^2} = - \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho_0 r
$$

Integrate from $ r $ to $ R $. But we need a **boundary condition**. Usually, we assume that the velocity dispersion goes to zero at the surface: $ \sigma_r(R) = 0 $. However, in real systems, that’s not strictly true, but for an idealized uniform sphere in isolation, this is a common assumption.

But wait! The problem says: **""Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v"" at radius R**.

So **at r = R**, $ \sigma_r(R) = v $. That contradicts the usual boundary condition of $ \sigma_r(R) = 0 $. So perhaps instead, we should use a **global virial theorem** approach, which avoids needing detailed boundary conditions.

---

#### Step 2b: Use Virial Theorem for Uniform Sphere

The scalar virial theorem states:

$$
2K + U = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2K = -U
$$

For a spherical isotropic system, the kinetic energy is:

$$
K = \frac{3}{2} M \langle \sigma^2 \rangle
$$

Because in 3D, each degree of freedom contributes $ \frac{1}{2} M \sigma_i^2 $, and if isotropic, $ \sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2 = \sigma_z^2 = \sigma^2 $, so total kinetic energy is $ \frac{3}{2} M \sigma^2 $. But careful: **observed radial velocity dispersion** is often only one component. If the system is isotropic, then:

$$
\langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad K = \frac{1}{2} M \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{2} M \sigma_r^2
$$

So yes, $ K = \frac{3}{2} M \sigma_r^2 $

Now, potential energy $ U $ for a **uniform density sphere** is:

$$
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M^2}{R}
$$

Plug into virial theorem:

$$
2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} M \sigma_r^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M^2}{R}
$$

Simplify:

$$
3 M \sigma_r^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M^2}{R}
$$

Cancel 3 and one M:

$$
\sigma_r^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M}{R}
$$

Solve for $ M $:

$$
M_B = \frac{5 \sigma_r^2 R}{G}
$$

Given that **radial velocity dispersion at radius R is v**, and assuming that $ \sigma_r $ is roughly constant (or that the value v represents the characteristic dispersion of the system), we take $ \sigma_r = v $. This is a standard approximation when only a single dispersion value is given for a galaxy.

✅ **Mass of Galaxy B**:

$$
\boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

- **Galaxy A (spiral)**: $ M_A = \dfrac{v^2 R}{G} $
- **Galaxy B (elliptical, uniform sphere)**: $ M_B = \dfrac{5 v^2 R}{G} $

Thus, **Galaxy B is 5 times more massive than Galaxy A**, even though both have the same size and characteristic speed $ v $, because **random motions (dispersion)** require more mass to support the same velocity scale in a pressure-supported system compared to rotation-supported systems, **for a uniform density sphere**.

> **Note**: The factor of 5 comes specifically from the potential energy of a uniform sphere. Real elliptical galaxies have different density profiles (e.g., King models, de Vaucouleurs), which would give different numerical factors (often around 5–10). But given the problem specifies **uniform, evenly-spaced stars**, the uniform sphere is appropriate.",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"We are asked to find the **density** of a white dwarf as a function of its total mass $ M $, the atomic number $ Z $, mass number $ A $, and fundamental constants. This involves balancing **electron degeneracy pressure** (outward) with **gravitational pressure** (inward), under the assumption that the star is supported solely by degeneracy pressure — i.e., in hydrostatic equilibrium.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given expressions

#### Electron degeneracy pressure:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
$$
where:
- $ n $ = electron number density (electrons per unit volume)
- $ \hbar $ = reduced Planck constant
- $ m_e $ = electron mass

#### Gravitational pressure:
Given:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3 G M^2}{5 R}
$$
So,
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V}
$$
But for a sphere, $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $, so:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

However, **for equilibrium**, we set:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

But perhaps an even better approach is to use **energy minimization** or directly equate the two pressures as given. The problem gives $ p_{\text{grav}} = -\Omega/(3V) $, and since $ \Omega < 0 $, this yields a positive pressure.

So:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{|\Omega|}{3V} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V}
$$

Again, with $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $, then:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

We'll keep this expression for now.

---

### Step 2: Relate electron number density $ n $ to mass density $ \rho $

Let’s denote:
- $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} $ = mass density of the white dwarf
- The star is made of fully ionized atoms with atomic number $ Z $ (number of protons/electrons per nucleus) and mass number $ A $ (nucleons per nucleus)

Assume nuclei are much heavier than electrons, so total mass $ M \approx N_{\text{nuclei}} \cdot A m_p $, where $ m_p $ is proton mass (we’ll approximate neutron mass ≈ proton mass).

Number of nuclei:  
$$
N_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{M}{A m_p}
$$

Each nucleus contributes $ Z $ free electrons, so total number of electrons:
$$
N_e = Z \cdot N_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p}
$$

Thus, electron number density:
$$
n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p V} = \frac{Z}{A m_p} \cdot \frac{M}{V} = \frac{Z}{A m_p} \rho
$$

So:
$$
n = \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p}
$$

This is a key relation.

---

### Step 3: Equate the two pressures

Set:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

Left-hand side:
$$
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Right-hand side:
$$
p_g = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot (M / \rho)} = \frac{G M \rho}{5 R}
$$
Wait! Because $ V = M / \rho $, so:
$$
p_g = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R} \cdot \frac{\rho}{M} = \frac{G M \rho}{5 R}
$$

That’s simpler!

So now equate:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{G M \rho}{5 R}
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{G M \rho}{R}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho $. But note that $ R $ is still present. We need to eliminate $ R $ using $ M $ and $ \rho $, since $ M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \Rightarrow R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} $

So:
$$
\frac{1}{R} = \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{1/3}
$$

Thus, RHS becomes:
$$
G M \rho \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{1/3} = G M^{2/3} \rho \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3} \right)^{1/3}
= G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now LHS:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3}
$$

So equating both sides:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3}
= G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Divide both sides by $ \rho^{4/3} $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3}
= G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho^{1/3} $:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} M^{2/3} m_e }{ \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} }
$$

Simplify the constants:

First, bring all terms together:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ G m_e }{ \hbar^2 } \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot M^{2/3} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Now raise both sides to the power 3:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{ G m_e }{ \hbar^2 } \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot M^{2/3} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3
$$

Compute the constant factor:

- Numerator: $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} $
- Denominator: $ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} = 3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3} $

So the ratio:
$$
\frac{ (4\pi/3)^{1/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } = \frac{4^{1/3} \pi^{1/3} 3^{-1/3} }{ 3^{2/3} \pi^{4/3} } = 4^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-1/3 - 2/3} \cdot \pi^{1/3 - 4/3} = 4^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot \pi^{-1}
$$

Because:
- $ 3^{-1/3 - 2/3} = 3^{-1} $
- $ \pi^{1/3 - 4/3} = \pi^{-1} $

And $ 4^{1/3} = (2^2)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} $

So the constant becomes:
$$
\frac{2^{2/3}}{3 \pi}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{ G m_e }{ \hbar^2 } \cdot \frac{2^{2/3}}{3 \pi} \cdot M^{2/3} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3
$$

Now distribute the cube:

$$
\rho = \left( \frac{ G m_e }{ \hbar^2 } \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{2^{2/3}}{3 \pi} \right)^3 \cdot M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5
$$

Compute $ \left( \frac{2^{2/3}}{3 \pi} \right)^3 = \frac{2^2}{27 \pi^3} = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} $

So finally:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \left( \frac{ G m_e }{ \hbar^2 } \right)^3 \cdot M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

This gives the **mass density** $ \rho $ of a white dwarf in terms of its total mass $ M $, the nuclear mass number $ A $, atomic number $ Z $, and fundamental constants $ G, m_e, \hbar, m_p $.

> **Note**: This result reflects the well-known scaling $ \rho \propto M^2 $ for non-relativistic white dwarfs, which leads to the inverse relation between radius and mass ($ R \propto M^{-1/3} $), and ultimately to the Chandrasekhar limit when relativistic effects are included.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

- Each dipole produces a magnetic field.
- The interaction energy is the energy of **one dipole in the magnetic field produced by the other**.
- Since energy is symmetric in the two dipoles (Newton’s third law analog for magnetostatics), it doesn’t matter which one we consider as the source and which as the test dipole.

We’ll compute the magnetic field $ \vec{B}_1 $ produced by dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at the location of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $, then compute the potential energy of $ \vec{m}_2 $ in that field:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1(\vec{r})
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the given formula for magnetic field of a dipole

The magnetic field due to a dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at position $ \vec{r} = r \hat{r} $ is:

$$
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute interaction energy

Now plug into the energy formula:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1 = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

Take constants outside:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Distribute the dot product:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]
$$

So the final expression is:

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"We are asked to find expressions for the **total energy** and the **orbital angular momentum** of an electron orbiting a proton under the assumption that:

- The only force is the Coulomb attraction.
- The proton mass \( m_p \) is **much greater** than the electron mass \( m_e \), i.e., \( m_p \gg m_e \).
- The electron orbits at a radius \( r \).
- Use \( e \) for the elementary charge (magnitude).

This is essentially the **Bohr model setup**, but we are not quantizing anything yet — just writing classical expressions under the given assumptions.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

Because \( m_p \gg m_e \), we can treat the proton as **stationary** at the origin, and the electron orbits around it in a circular orbit of radius \( r \). This avoids dealing with reduced mass or center-of-mass motion — a standard approximation in introductory atomic physics.

The Coulomb force provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion.

---

### Step 2: Write the force balance equation

The magnitude of the Coulomb force between the proton and electron is:

\[
F_{\text{Coulomb}} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}
\]

This must equal the centripetal force required for circular motion of the electron:

\[
F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
\]

Setting them equal:

\[
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( r \):

\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
\tag{1}
\]

This will be useful for computing kinetic and total energy.

---

### Step 3: Compute the total energy

Total energy \( E \) = kinetic energy \( K \) + potential energy \( U \)

- Kinetic energy: \( K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 \)
- Electrostatic potential energy (electron–proton):  
  \[
  U = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
  \]
  (negative because it's an attractive interaction)

From equation (1), we have \( m_e v^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r} \), so:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r} = \frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
\]

Thus, total energy:

\[
E = K + U = \frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r} = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
\]

✅ **Total energy**:  
\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r}}
\]

---

### Step 4: Compute the orbital angular momentum

For circular motion, the magnitude of orbital angular momentum \( L \) of the electron is:

\[
L = m_e v r
\]

We need to express this in terms of known quantities (i.e., \( e, r, m_e, \varepsilon_0 \)).

From equation (1):  
\[
v^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
v = \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}}
\]

Then:

\[
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}} = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}}
\]

Simplify inside the square root:

\[
L = m_e r \cdot \frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}} = e \cdot \frac{m_e r}{\sqrt{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r}}
\]

Now simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{m_e r}{\sqrt{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r} \cdot \sqrt{m_e r} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r}
\]

More directly:

\[
\frac{m_e r}{\sqrt{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r} \cdot \sqrt{m_e r} / \sqrt{m_e r} = \sqrt{m_e r}
\]

So:

\[
L = e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{m_e r}}{\sqrt{4\pi \varepsilon_0}} = e \sqrt{\frac{m_e r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}}
\]

✅ **Orbital angular momentum**:  
\[
\boxed{L = e \sqrt{\frac{m_e r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}}}
\]

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy**:  
  \[
  E = -\dfrac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
  \]

- **Orbital angular momentum**:  
  \[
  L = e \sqrt{\dfrac{m_e r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}}

These are classical expressions under the assumption \( m_p \gg m_e \), so the proton is fixed and the electron moves in a circular orbit due to Coulomb attraction.",0.637
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"We are given a scenario involving a meteorite colliding with a space station in circular orbit around Earth, and after the collision, the combined object (conglomerate) moves in a **closed orbit** that has a **perigee (closest approach)** of $ R/2 $. The original orbit of the space station is circular with radius $ R $.

We are to find:

1. The speed of the meteorite just before collision,
2. The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
3. The maximum distance (apogee) from Earth’s center,
4. A condition on masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ for this to be possible.

We will proceed step by step using conservation laws: **conservation of linear momentum** (for the instantaneous collision), and **conservation of energy and angular momentum** (for orbital motion under gravity).

---

### Step 0: Known Quantities and Assumptions

- Earth mass = $ M $, gravitational constant = $ G $
- Space station mass = $ m_2 $, in **circular orbit** of radius $ R $
- Meteorite mass = $ m_1 $, moving **radially inward** toward Earth (i.e., its velocity vector points directly toward Earth's center)
- Collision is **perfectly inelastic**: they stick together → conglomerate mass = $ m = m_1 + m_2 $
- After collision, conglomerate follows a **closed Keplerian orbit** (ellipse) with **perigee = $ R/2 $**
- The collision occurs at radius $ R $, since that’s where the space station is.
- Gravitational influence of meteorite and space station on each other and on Earth is negligible (standard two-body approximation with Earth fixed)

---

## Step 1: Determine Orbital Speed of Space Station Before Collision

For a circular orbit of radius $ R $, centripetal force = gravitational force:

$$
\frac{m_2 v_0^2}{R} = \frac{G M m_2}{R^2} \Rightarrow v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

So the space station’s velocity is **tangential**, magnitude $ v_0 = \sqrt{GM/R} $.

Let’s define coordinate system:

- At collision point (at radius $ R $), let position vector be along $ x $-axis: $ \vec{r} = R \hat{x} $
- Then space station velocity is in $ +y $ direction: $ \vec{v}_2 = v_0 \hat{y} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{y} $
- Meteorite is moving **radially inward**, so its velocity is along $ -x $: $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{x} $, where $ v_1 > 0 $ is the speed we need to find.

---

## Step 2: Apply Conservation of Linear Momentum at Collision

Since external forces (gravity) act over a finite time, but the collision is assumed instantaneous, **linear momentum is conserved during the collision**.

Total momentum before = total momentum after:

$$
m_1 (-v_1 \hat{x}) + m_2 (v_0 \hat{y}) = (m_1 + m_2) \vec{V}
$$

So post-collision velocity of conglomerate:

$$
\vec{V} = \frac{-m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \hat{x} + \frac{m_2 v_0}{m_1 + m_2} \hat{y}
$$

Let’s denote:

- $ V_x = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m} $
- $ V_y = \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} $, where $ m = m_1 + m_2 $

So speed squared after collision:

$$
V^2 = V_x^2 + V_y^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \right)^2
$$

We’ll need this for energy.

Also, **angular momentum** about Earth’s center is conserved **after** the collision (since gravity is central), but **not during** the collision? Wait — actually, **angular momentum is also conserved during the collision**, because the only external force is gravity, which is central (acts along radial direction), and during an instantaneous collision, impulse due to gravity is negligible. So **total angular momentum is conserved through the collision**.

But easier: compute angular momentum **after** collision directly from $ \vec{r} \times \vec{p} $, since we know position and velocity just after collision.

At collision point: $ \vec{r} = R \hat{x} $, $ \vec{V} = V_x \hat{x} + V_y \hat{y} $

Then angular momentum (per unit mass or total?) — better use **specific angular momentum** (angular momentum per unit total mass) for orbital analysis, but let's first compute **total angular momentum**:

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times (m \vec{V}) = R \hat{x} \times m(V_x \hat{x} + V_y \hat{y}) = m R V_y (\hat{x} \times \hat{y}) = m R V_y \hat{z}
$$

Because $ \hat{x} \times \hat{x} = 0 $, $ \hat{x} \times \hat{y} = \hat{z} $

So magnitude:

$$
L = m R V_y = m R \cdot \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} = m_2 R v_0 = m_2 R \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = m_2 \sqrt{G M R}
$$

**Important**: The radial component of velocity (from meteorite) contributes **nothing** to angular momentum! So total angular momentum after collision is same as that of space station before collision. That makes sense because meteorite had zero angular momentum (pure radial motion).

Thus, **specific angular momentum** (angular momentum per unit total mass) of conglomerate:

$$
h = \frac{L}{m} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
$$

We'll use this in orbital mechanics.

---

## Step 3: Use Orbital Mechanics for Post-Collision Orbit

After collision, conglomerate moves in a **Keplerian orbit** under Earth’s gravity. Given:

- It passes through point $ r = R $ (collision point)
- Its **perigee** (minimum distance) is $ r_{\min} = R/2 $
- The orbit is **closed** → it must be an **ellipse**

So the orbit is an **ellipse** with perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, and at some true anomaly, it is at $ r = R $. We can use conservation of **energy** and **angular momentum** to relate these.

For any Keplerian orbit:

- Specific mechanical energy: $ \varepsilon = \frac{V^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2a} $, where $ a $ = semi-major axis
- Specific angular momentum: $ h = r V_\perp $, where $ V_\perp $ is tangential component of velocity
- Perigee and apogee: $ r_p = a(1 - e) $, $ r_a = a(1 + e) $, where $ e $ = eccentricity
- Also, $ h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2) $

We know:

- At perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, speed is **maximum** (since closest point)
- At apogee $ r_a = ? $, speed is **minimum**
- At collision point $ r = R $, speed = $ V $, with components known

We are told the orbit **approaches Earth at minimum distance R/2**, so **perigee = R/2**. Since the collision happens at $ r = R > R/2 $, the collision point is **not** at perigee. So the conglomerate will **later reach perigee at R/2**, meaning that **after collision, it moves inward**.

That implies that the **radial component of velocity after collision is negative** (inward), which matches our setup: meteorite adds inward radial velocity.

Now, use known formulas.

### Step 3a: Express semi-major axis in terms of perigee and apogee

Let $ r_p = R/2 $, $ r_a = r_{\max} $ (to find in part iii)

Then:

$$
a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} = \frac{R/2 + r_a}{2}
$$

Also,

$$
h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2) = G M \cdot \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \left( \frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p} \right)^2 \right)
$$

But there’s a simpler relation:

$$
h^2 = G M \cdot \frac{2 r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

This comes from combining $ r_p = a(1 - e) $, $ r_a = a(1 + e) $, so $ a = (r_p + r_a)/2 $, $ e = (r_a - r_p)/(r_a + r_p) $, then:

$$
h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2) = G M \cdot \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p} \right)^2 \right ) = G M \cdot \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} \cdot \frac{4 r_p r_a}{(r_p + r_a)^2} = G M \cdot \frac{2 r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

Yes.

So:

$$
h^2 = \frac{2 G M r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

We already have expression for $ h $:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} \Rightarrow h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 G M R
$$

Set equal:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 G M R = \frac{2 G M r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

Cancel $ G M $:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 R = \frac{2 r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

Recall $ r_p = R/2 $. Plug in:

Left: $ \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 R $

Right: $ \frac{2 \cdot (R/2) \cdot r_a}{(R/2) + r_a} = \frac{R r_a}{(R/2) + r_a} $

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 R = \frac{R r_a}{(R/2) + r_a}
$$

Cancel $ R $ (assuming $ R \ne 0 $):

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 = \frac{r_a}{(R/2) + r_a}
$$

Solve for $ r_a $:

Multiply both sides by $ (R/2 + r_a) $:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \left( \frac{R}{2} + r_a \right) = r_a
$$

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{R}{2} + \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 r_a = r_a
$$

Bring terms with $ r_a $ together:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{R}{2} = r_a \left( 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \right )
$$

So:

$$
r_a = \frac{ \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{R}{2} }{ 1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 } = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 (m^2 - m_2^2) } = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 ( (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 ) }
$$

Simplify denominator:

$$
(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 - m_2^2 = m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)
$$

So:

$$
r_a = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }
$$

Wait — but hold on! This gives apogee **less than R** if $ m_1 $ is large? But collision occurs at $ r = R $, and perigee is $ R/2 $, so **R must be between perigee and apogee**, i.e., $ r_p < R < r_a $ **or** $ r_a < R < r_p $. But since $ r_p = R/2 < R $, then either:

- The orbit has **apogee > R**, so the object was moving from apogee toward perigee at collision (inward radial velocity), OR
- The orbit has **apogee < R**, which would mean $ R $ is outside the orbit — impossible, since object is at $ R $ after collision.

So we must have $ r_a > R $. Therefore, our expression for $ r_a $ must satisfy $ r_a > R $. Let's check:

$$
r_a = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) } > R \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{ m_2^2 }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) } > 1
$$

But left side is **less than 1** for all positive $ m_1, m_2 $. For example, if $ m_1 \to 0 $, then $ r_a \to \frac{m_2^2 R}{0} \to \infty $ — okay. If $ m_1 \to \infty $, $ r_a \to 0 $. So actually, **$ r_a > R $ only if $ m_1 $ is sufficiently small**.

But wait — maybe I made a mistake in interpretation: perhaps the collision point is **between perigee and apogee**, but closer to apogee? But perigee is $ R/2 $, collision at $ R $. So if apogee is **less than R**, then the orbit never reaches R — contradiction. So **must have $ r_a \ge R $**.

Therefore, the derived formula must yield $ r_a \ge R $. Let's double-check derivation.

Go back:

We had:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R}
$$

Correct, because angular momentum came only from space station.

Then used:

$$
h^2 = \frac{2 G M r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a}
$$

Yes, standard result.

Plug $ r_p = R/2 $:

$$
h^2 = \frac{2 G M (R/2) r_a}{R/2 + r_a} = \frac{G M R r_a}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

Set equal to $ (m_2/m)^2 G M R $:

$$
(m_2/m)^2 G M R = \frac{G M R r_a}{R/2 + r_a}
\Rightarrow (m_2/m)^2 = \frac{r_a}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

Yes.

Then solving:

$$
(m_2/m)^2 (R/2 + r_a) = r_a \Rightarrow (m_2/m)^2 R/2 = r_a (1 - (m_2/m)^2)
\Rightarrow r_a = \frac{(m_2/m)^2 R/2}{1 - (m_2/m)^2}
$$

This is correct.

Now note that $ (m_2/m)^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} < 1 $, so denominator positive.

Now, when is $ r_a > R $? Let's solve inequality:

$$
\frac{(m_2/m)^2 R/2}{1 - (m_2/m)^2} > R
\Rightarrow \frac{(m_2/m)^2}{2(1 - (m_2/m)^2)} > 1
\Rightarrow (m_2/m)^2 > 2(1 - (m_2/m)^2)
\Rightarrow (m_2/m)^2 > 2 - 2(m_2/m)^2
\Rightarrow 3(m_2/m)^2 > 2
\Rightarrow (m_2/m)^2 > 2/3
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} > \sqrt{2/3} \approx 0.816
\Rightarrow m_2 > 0.816 (m_1 + m_2)
\Rightarrow m_2 (1 - 0.816) > 0.816 m_1
\Rightarrow 0.184 m_2 > 0.816 m_1
\Rightarrow \frac{m_1}{m_2} < \frac{0.184}{0.816} \approx 0.225
$$

So **only if meteorite is less than ~22.5% of space station mass** will apogee be beyond R. But is that required?

Wait! Maybe the collision point **is the apogee**? But no, because radial velocity after collision is **inward** (since meteorite is falling radially), so the object is moving **toward perigee**, so the collision point must be **apogee or somewhere between apogee and perigee**. But if radial velocity is non-zero, it cannot be at apogee or perigee (where radial velocity = 0). So collision point is **between apogee and perigee**, with inward radial velocity → so **apogee > R > perigee = R/2**. So yes, must have $ r_a > R $.

Therefore, the scenario is **only possible if $ r_a > R $**, which imposes condition on masses. We’ll return to this for the last part.

But perhaps we don’t need to assume that yet. Let's proceed to find meteorite speed.

---

## Step 4: Use Energy Conservation to Find Meteorite Speed

We know post-collision **specific energy**:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{V^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

But also, for elliptical orbit with perigee $ r_p = R/2 $ and apogee $ r_a $, the specific energy is:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a} = -\frac{GM}{r_p + r_a}
$$

Because $ a = (r_p + r_a)/2 $

So:

$$
\frac{V^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{r_p + r_a} = -\frac{GM}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{V^2}{2} = \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{R/2 + r_a} = GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} \right )
$$

But we also have expression for $ V^2 $ from momentum conservation:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right ] = GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} \right )
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} = 2 GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} \right )
$$

Now solve for $ v_1 $:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = 2 GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} \right ) - \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

But recall from earlier:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 = \frac{r_a}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

So substitute:

First term: $ 2 GM \left( \frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} \right ) $

Second term: $ \frac{r_a}{R/2 + r_a} \cdot \frac{GM}{R} $

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = GM \left[ \frac{2}{R} - \frac{2}{R/2 + r_a} - \frac{r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)} \right ]
$$

Combine the last two terms over common denominator $ R(R/2 + r_a) $:

$$
- \frac{2R}{R(R/2 + r_a)} - \frac{r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)} = - \frac{2R + r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)}
$$

Wait, careful:

Actually:

$$
\frac{2}{R} - \left[ \frac{2}{R/2 + r_a} + \frac{r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)} \right ] = \frac{2}{R} - \frac{2R + r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)}
$$

Yes.

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = GM \left[ \frac{2}{R} - \frac{2R + r_a}{R(R/2 + r_a)} \right ] = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ 2 - \frac{2R + r_a}{R/2 + r_a} \right ]
$$

Now simplify bracket:

Let $ D = R/2 + r_a $. Then:

$$
2 - \frac{2R + r_a}{D} = \frac{2D - (2R + r_a)}{D} = \frac{2(R/2 + r_a) - 2R - r_a}{D} = \frac{R + 2 r_a - 2R - r_a}{D} = \frac{ -R + r_a }{D } = \frac{r_a - R}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{r_a - R}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

Therefore:

$$
v_1^2 = \left( \frac{m}{m_1} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{r_a - R}{R/2 + r_a}
$$

But we can eliminate $ r_a $ using earlier relation:

We had:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 = \frac{r_a}{R/2 + r_a} \Rightarrow R/2 + r_a = \frac{r_a}{(m_2/m)^2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{R/2 + r_a} = \frac{(m_2/m)^2}{r_a}
$$

But maybe better to express everything in terms of known quantities without $ r_a $. Alternatively, use **conservation of energy and angular momentum at perigee**.

### Alternate Approach: Use Conditions at Perigee

At perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, radial velocity = 0, speed = $ v_{\min} $ or $ v_{\max} $? Since perigee is closest, speed is **maximum**.

Let $ v_p $ = speed at perigee.

Then:

- Angular momentum: $ h = r_p v_p = (R/2) v_p $
- But we also have $ h = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} $

So:

$$
\frac{R}{2} v_p = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} \Rightarrow v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Similarly, at apogee $ r_a $, speed $ v_a = h / r_a = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} / r_a $

But also, from energy:

$$
\frac{v_p^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_p} = \frac{v_a^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_a} = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

But maybe we can now find $ v_1 $ more directly.

Recall that just after collision, at $ r = R $, the velocity components are:

- Radial: $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m} $
- Tangential: $ V_t = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } $

In orbital mechanics, at any point:

$$
V_r^2 = \frac{2GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{a} - \frac{h^2}{r^2}
$$

But perhaps plug into energy equation:

Specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{V_r^2 + V_t^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{r_p + r_a}
$$

But we also know that for an ellipse with perigee $ r_p $, the **specific energy** can be written as:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a} = -\frac{GM}{r_p + r_a}
$$

But we don’t know $ r_a $ yet. However, we can find $ \varepsilon $ also from perigee:

At perigee, $ V_r = 0 $, so:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{v_p^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_p} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2 m_2}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \right)^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4 m_2^2}{m^2} \cdot \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2 GM}{R} = \left( \frac{2 m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

So:

$$
\varepsilon = 2 \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right) \frac{GM}{R} = -2 \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

But also, from collision point:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right ) - \frac{GM}{R}
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2 m^2} - 1 \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Set equal to previous expression:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2 m^2} - 1 \right) \frac{GM}{R} = -2 \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \frac{GM}{R} = -4 \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Bring terms together:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = \left[ -4 \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right) - \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \right] \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Simplify bracket:

$$
-4 + 4 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 2 = (-4 + 2) + (4 - 1) \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = -2 + 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}
$$

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 = \left( 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Therefore:

$$
v_1^2 = \left( \frac{m}{m_1} \right)^2 \left( 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \frac{GM}{R} = \left( \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2 m^2}{m_1^2} \right) \frac{GM}{R}
$$

But $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, so:

$$
3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 = 3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2 = (m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2)
$$

So:

$$
v_1^2 = \frac{ m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 }{ m_1^2 } \cdot \frac{GM}{R}
$$

For $ v_1^2 > 0 $, numerator must be positive:

$$
m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 > 0
\Rightarrow m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
$$

This is a quadratic in $ m_2 $:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
$$

Solve equality:

$$
m_2 = \frac{4 m_1 \pm \sqrt{16 m_1^2 + 8 m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4 m_1 \pm \sqrt{24} m_1}{2} = m_1 \cdot \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{6}}{2} = m_1 (2 \pm \sqrt{6})
$$

Since $ \sqrt{6} \approx 2.45 $, then $ 2 - \sqrt{6} < 0 $, discard. So inequality holds when:

$$
m_2 > m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6}) \approx m_1 (4.45)
\Rightarrow \frac{m_1}{m_2} < \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{6}} \approx 0.225
$$

Same as earlier! Good.

So **condition for real (positive) meteorite speed** is:

$$
m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1
$$

This ensures $ v_1^2 > 0 $, and also ensures orbit is bound (energy negative) and apogee > R.

Now, finally, answer parts.

## (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision

From above:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1^2} \right) \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Simplify numerator:

$$
3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2 = m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{ v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{ m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 }{ m_1^2 } \cdot \frac{GM}{R} } }
$$

Alternatively, factor differently:

$$
v_1 = \frac{ \sqrt{ 3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 } }{ m_1 } \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Either form acceptable.

---

## (ii) Minimum and Maximum Speeds of Conglomerate

- **Maximum speed** occurs at **perigee** $ r = R/2 $
- **Minimum speed** occurs at **apogee** $ r = r_a $

We already found speed at perigee:

$$
v_{\max} = v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

For apogee, use angular momentum conservation:

$$
v_{\min} = v_a = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} }{ r_a }
$$

But we can also use vis-viva equation:

$$
v_a = \sqrt{ GM \left( \frac{2}{r_a} - \frac{1}{a} \right ) }, \quad a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2}
$$

But better to express in terms of knowns. From earlier, we have:

$$
r_a = \frac{ (m_2/m)^2 R/2 }{ 1 - (m_2/m)^2 } = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 (m^2 - m_2^2) }
$$

Then:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{ m_2 \sqrt{G M R} / m }{ r_a } = \frac{ m_2 \sqrt{G M R} }{ m } \cdot \frac{ 2 (m^2 - m_2^2) }{ m_2^2 R } = \frac{ 2 (m^2 - m_2^2) }{ m m_2 } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Simplify $ m^2 - m_2^2 = (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 $

So:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{ 2 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) }{ (m_1 + m_2) m_2 } \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } = \frac{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }{ m_2 (m_1 + m_2) } \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Thus:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
v_{\max} &= \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \\
v_{\min} &= \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{ m_2 (m_1 + m_2) } \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
\end{aligned}
}
$$

Note: For the orbit to be physical, we must have $ v_{\min} < v_{\max} $, which again leads to same mass condition.

---

## (iii) Maximum Distance from Earth Center

We already derived:

$$
r_a = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{ r_{\max} = \frac{ m_2^2 }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) } R }
$$

---

## Condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $

For the scenario to be possible:

1. The post-collision orbit must be **bound** → specific energy < 0
2. Perigee must be $ R/2 $ → requires sufficient angular momentum
3. Meteorite speed must be real → $ v_1^2 > 0 $
4. Apogee must be > R (so that collision point is within orbit)

All lead to same condition:

From $ v_1^2 > 0 $:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
\Rightarrow m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1
$$

Thus, the required condition is:

$$
\boxed{ m_2 > (2 + \sqrt{6}) \, m_1 }
$$

---

## Shape of the Orbit

Given it's a **closed orbit** with perigee and apogee, and total energy negative, the orbit is an **ellipse**.

$$
\boxed{ \text{The orbit is an ellipse.} }
$$

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that **surface brightness (or surface magnitude)** is **independent of distance** in a **non-expanding universe**, we need to understand how **flux**, **solid angle**, and **magnitude** scale with distance.

We’ll proceed step by step, using physical definitions and the properties of light in Euclidean (non-expanding) space.

---

### Step 1: Definitions

- **Apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to its observed flux $ F $ by:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
  $$
  where $ F_0 $ is a reference flux.

- **Surface brightness** (in magnitudes per unit solid angle) is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle. In practice, astronomers often use **magnitudes per square arcminute**, but the key idea is that it's **flux per unit solid angle**, converted to a magnitude scale.

- **Solid angle** $ \Omega $ of an object at distance $ D $ with physical area $ A $ (perpendicular to the line of sight) is:
  $$
  \Omega = \frac{A}{D^2}
  $$
  (This is valid in Euclidean geometry for small angles.)

- The **total flux** $ F $ received from an extended object with intrinsic luminosity $ L $ is:
  $$
  F = \frac{L}{4\pi D^2}
  $$
  This is the **inverse-square law**.

But for **surface brightness**, we care about **flux per unit solid angle**, not total flux.

---

### Step 2: Flux per unit solid angle

Let’s consider a small patch of the galaxy with:

- Intrinsic luminosity $ dL $
- Observed flux from that patch: $ dF = \frac{dL}{4\pi D^2} $
- Solid angle subtended by that patch: $ d\Omega = \frac{dA}{D^2} $, where $ dA $ is the physical area corresponding to that patch (assuming it radiates isotropically and uniformly).

Now, define **specific intensity** or **surface brightness** in physical units as:
$$
I = \frac{dF}{d\Omega}
$$

Plug in the expressions:
$$
I = \frac{dL / (4\pi D^2)}{dA / D^2} = \frac{dL}{4\pi dA}
$$

**Crucially, the $ D^2 $ cancels out!** So $ I $ is **independent of distance** in a non-expanding (Euclidean) universe.

This is a well-known result in astrophysics: **surface brightness is invariant with distance** in static Euclidean space.

---

### Step 3: Convert to magnitudes per unit solid angle

Now, magnitude is a logarithmic measure of flux. So, if the **flux per unit solid angle** does not change with distance, then the **magnitude per unit solid angle** also does not change.

Let’s make this precise.

Suppose we measure the flux per square arcminute: $ f = \frac{F}{\Omega} $ (in practice, averaged over some region).

Then the **surface magnitude** $ \mu $ is defined as:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{f}{f_0} \right) = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F/\Omega}{f_0} \right)
$$
where $ f_0 $ is a reference flux per square arcminute.

From earlier:
- $ F \propto D^{-2} $
- $ \Omega \propto D^{-2} $

So:
$$
\frac{F}{\Omega} \propto \frac{D^{-2}}{D^{-2}} = \text{constant}
$$

Therefore, $ f $ is constant with distance → $ \mu $ is constant with distance.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

In a **non-expanding universe** (i.e., Euclidean geometry, no cosmological redshift, no expansion effects), the **surface brightness** (or **surface magnitude**) of a galaxy **does not depend on its distance**.

This is because both the observed flux and the solid angle decrease as $ 1/D^2 $, so their ratio — which determines surface brightness — remains constant.

✅ **Hence, surface magnitude is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe.**

--- 

### Final Note:

This invariance **breaks down in an expanding universe** due to:
- Cosmological redshift (reducing photon energy and rate),
- Angular diameter distance not scaling as $ D^{-2} $,
- Time dilation,
- Tolman surface brightness test: in expanding universe, surface brightness ∝ $ (1+z)^{-4} $.

But the question specifies a **non-expanding universe**, so those effects are absent.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"To derive **Kepler’s laws** from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, we proceed step by step, using classical mechanics. Kepler’s three empirical laws describe planetary motion, and Newton later showed they follow from his inverse-square law of gravitation.

We will derive all three laws:

---

## **Step 1: Recall Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

The gravitational force between two masses \( M \) (e.g., the Sun) and \( m \) (e.g., a planet) is:

\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( r \) is the distance between the masses,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from \( M \) to \( m \),
- The negative sign indicates attraction (force on \( m \) is toward \( M \)).

Assuming \( M \gg m \), we treat \( M \) as fixed at the origin (center-of-mass approximation). Then the planet of mass \( m \) moves under a central force.

---

## **Step 2: Use Newton’s Second Law**

\[
m \vec{a} = \vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\Rightarrow \vec{a} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

This is a **central force**: always directed toward a fixed point (the Sun), and depends only on \( r \).

Central forces conserve **angular momentum**, which is key to deriving Kepler’s laws.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s First Law: Orbits are Ellipses with the Sun at One Focus**

### Step 2.1: Conservation of Angular Momentum

Define angular momentum per unit mass:  
\[
\vec{h} = \vec{r} \times \vec{v}
\]

Since force is central, torque \( \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0 \), so \( \vec{h} \) is constant.

Thus, motion is confined to a plane (perpendicular to \( \vec{h} \)), and we can use **plane polar coordinates** \( (r, \theta) \).

In polar coordinates, the acceleration is:

\[
\vec{a} = (\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) \hat{r} + (2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} + r \ddot{\theta}) \hat{\theta}
\]

But from Newton’s law, only radial component exists:

\[
\vec{a} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

So the transverse (θ) component must vanish:

\[
2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} + r \ddot{\theta} = 0
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \dot{\theta}) = 0
\Rightarrow r^2 \dot{\theta} = h = \text{constant}
\]

This is conservation of angular momentum per unit mass.

### Step 2.2: Change Variable to \( u = 1/r \)

To solve the orbit equation, use the standard trick: let \( u(\theta) = 1/r \). Then:

\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} \cdot \dot{\theta}
\]

But better: use known result from central force motion. The radial equation becomes:

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M}{h^2}
\]

**Derivation sketch**:

From radial acceleration:

\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

Use \( r = 1/u \), and \( \dot{\theta} = h / r^2 = h u^2 \)

Compute \( \ddot{r} \) in terms of \( u(\theta) \):

\[
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} \cdot h u^2 = -h \frac{du}{d\theta}
\]

\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(-h \frac{du}{d\theta}) = -h \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} \dot{\theta} = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2}
\]

Now plug into radial equation:

\[
-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - \frac{1}{u} (h u^2)^2 = -G M u^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} - h^2 u^3 = -G M u^2
\]

Divide both sides by \( -h^2 u^2 \):

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M}{h^2}
\]

This is a linear ODE. General solution:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Choose \( \theta_0 = 0 \) (rotate coordinate system), so:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\quad \text{where } e = \frac{A h^2}{G M}
\]

Thus,

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

This is the equation of a **conic section** with focus at the origin.

- If \( 0 \leq e < 1 \): ellipse
- \( e = 1 \): parabola
- \( e > 1 \): hyperbola

For bound orbits (planets), energy is negative → \( e < 1 \) → **ellipse**.

✅ **Kepler’s First Law**: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Second Law: Equal Areas in Equal Times**

From earlier, we found:

\[
r^2 \dot{\theta} = h = \text{constant}
\]

The area swept out by radius vector in time \( dt \) is:

\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\Rightarrow \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

Thus, **area swept per unit time is constant**.

✅ **Kepler’s Second Law** is a direct consequence of **conservation of angular momentum** under a central force.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \)**

We now relate orbital period \( T \) to semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 4.1: Total Area of Ellipse

Area of ellipse: \( A = \pi a b \), where \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \)

From second law: total area swept in one period \( T \) is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T r^2 \dot{\theta} \, dt = \frac{h}{2} T
\Rightarrow T = \frac{2A}{h} = \frac{2 \pi a b}{h}
\]

### Step 4.2: Express \( h \) in Terms of \( a \) and \( e \)

From orbit equation:

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h^2}{G M}
\]

For an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum \( p = a(1 - e^2) \)

So:

\[
\frac{h^2}{G M} = a(1 - e^2) \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}
\]

Now plug into expression for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{2 \pi a b}{h} = \frac{2 \pi a \cdot a \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2} \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M} \sqrt{1 - e^2}} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{G M}} a^{3/2}
\]

Thus:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G M}} \Rightarrow T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

✅ **Kepler’s Third Law**: The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.

For planets orbiting the Sun, \( M = M_\odot \), so \( T^2 \propto a^3 \) with same constant for all planets.

---

## ✅ Summary

Using **Newton’s law of universal gravitation** and **classical mechanics**, we derived:

1. **First Law**: Inverse-square central force ⇒ conic-section orbits; bound orbits are ellipses with central mass at one focus.
2. **Second Law**: Central force ⇒ conserved angular momentum ⇒ constant areal velocity.
3. **Third Law**: Combining geometry of ellipse with dynamics yields \( T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \).

Thus, **Kepler’s empirical laws are fully explained by Newtonian gravity**.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"We are asked to **derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location**, i.e., $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$, in two different scenarios:

- **Case I**: The actual observed (flat) rotation curve of the Galaxy.
- **Case II**: A hypothetical Keplerian rotation curve (mass concentrated at center, no dark matter).

To do this, we will **relate Oort constants $A$ and $B$** to the derivative $\frac{dV}{dR}|_{R_0}$, and then evaluate this derivative under each assumption about the rotation curve.

---

### Step 1: Recall definitions and relations

We are given that the Sun is at distance $R_0 = 8.5~\text{kpc}$ from Galactic Center (GC), and both Sun and HI cloud move in circular orbits with rotational velocities $V_0 = \Omega_0 R_0$, $V = \Omega R$.

Oort derived approximate forms for nearby objects ($D \ll R_0$):

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l,\quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D,
$$

where **Oort constants** $A$ and $B$ are defined as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right).
$$

These are **standard definitions** in Galactic dynamics, derived from expanding the velocity field near the solar neighborhood to first order in $D/R_0$. We can **invert these relations** to solve for the derivative $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$:

Add and subtract the equations:

- $A - B = \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$
- $A + B = \frac{V_0}{R_0}$

So,

$$
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = A - B}
$$

Thus, if we can find $A - B$ in each case (I and II), we have the desired derivative.

But more directly, we can **use the definition of $A$ and $B$** in terms of $V(R)$ to compute $\frac{dV}{dR}|_{R_0}$ under different assumptions about $V(R)$.

---

### Step 2: General expression for $\frac{dV}{dR}|_{R_0}$

From above:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
\Rightarrow
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2A
$$

Alternatively, using $A - B$:

$$
A - B = \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' \right) \right] - \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + V' \right) \right] = V'
$$

where $V' = \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$. So yes, confirmed.

Therefore, **our task reduces to evaluating $V'(R_0)$** under two different models of $V(R)$.

---

### Step 3: Case I — Observed rotation curve (flat)

In the real Milky Way, observations show that **the rotation curve is approximately flat** in the solar neighborhood and beyond. That is:

$$
V(R) \approx \text{constant} = V_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dV}{dR} = 0
$$

So,

$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}^{\text{(I)}} = 0 }
$$

This is the standard result: a flat rotation curve implies zero radial gradient in rotational velocity.

---

### Step 4: Case II — Keplerian rotation (mass concentrated at center)

If all mass is at the center (like a point mass $M$), then circular orbital velocity is given by:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( G M \right)^{1/2} R^{-1/2} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R^3} } = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, $V(R_0) = V_0$, so:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Thus,

$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}^{\text{(II)}} = -\frac{V_0}{2 R_0} }
$$

This is the expected result for a Keplerian decline.

---

### Final Answers:

- **Case I (observed flat rotation curve):**
  $$
  \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = 0
  $$

- **Case II (Keplerian, mass at center):**
  $$
  \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2 R_0}
  $$

V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \tag{1}
$$
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D \tag{2}
$$

Where:
- $ \Omega = V(R)/R $ is the angular velocity of the cloud,
- $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $ is the angular velocity of the Sun.

We are to consider **nearby clouds**, so $ D \ll R_0 $. Therefore, we can expand $ \Omega $ around $ R = R_0 $ using a Taylor expansion.

---

### Step 2: Geometry — relate $ R $, $ D $, and $ l $

From the law of cosines in the Galactic plane (Sun at distance $ R_0 $ from GC, cloud at distance $ D $ from Sun, at longitude $ l $):

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

Since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can expand $ R $ to first order in $ D $:

$$
R \approx R_0 - D \cos l \tag{3}
$$

(You can derive this by taking square root of the expression above and expanding to first order.)

---

### Step 3: Expand $ \Omega = V(R)/R $ around $ R_0 $

We write:

$$
\Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

We need $ \Omega - \Omega_0 $ to first order in $ D $. So expand $ \Omega(R) $ about $ R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
$$

Using Eq. (3): $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $, so:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \tag{4}
$$

Now compute $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ V $ and $ dV/dR $:

$$
\Omega = \frac{V}{R} \Rightarrow \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

Evaluated at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \tag{5}
$$

---

### Step 4: Plug into expression for $ V_r $

Recall:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

Substitute Eq. (4):

$$
V_r \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l
= - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin 2l
$$

So:

$$
V_r = \left[ -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right] D \sin 2l
$$

But Oort’s formula says:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

Therefore:

$$
A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \tag{6}
$$

Now substitute Eq. (5) into (6):

$$
A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right )
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right )
$$

So finally:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)} \tag{7}
$$

---

### Step 5: Now find $ B $ using transverse velocity

Recall exact expression:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

We already have $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $

So first term:

$$
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l
$$

Second term: $ \Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D $, since $ D \ll R_0 $, and difference would be second order.

So:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Now express $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $, so:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
$$

Group terms:

$$
V_t = \left[ -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \cos 2l \right] D + \left[ -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 \right] D
$$

Compare with Oort’s form:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

So we identify:

- Coefficient of $ \cos 2l $: $ A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ → consistent with earlier.
- Constant term: $ B = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 $

But from Eq. (6), $ A = -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $, so:

$$
B = A - \Omega_0 \tag{8}
$$

Now substitute $ A $ from Eq. (7) and $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $:

$$
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right ) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right )
$$

Thus:

$$
\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)} \tag{9}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right) \\
B &= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
\end{aligned}
}

These are the standard definitions of **Oort’s constants** in terms of the local rotational velocity and its radial derivative.

The motion is assumed to be **Keplerian circular orbits**, and the process is slow (so at each radius, the orbit is approximately circular). We're to **ignore self-gravity** of the disc.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total mechanical energy of a circular Keplerian orbit

For a test mass $ \Delta m $ in a **circular orbit** around a central mass $ M $, the **total mechanical energy** (kinetic + gravitational potential) is well known:

- Gravitational potential energy:  
  $$
  U = -\frac{G M \Delta m}{r}
  $$

- Kinetic energy (from centripetal force = gravity):  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \Delta m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \left( \frac{G M}{r} \right) = \frac{G M \Delta m}{2r}
  $$

So total mechanical energy:
$$
E = K + U = \frac{G M \Delta m}{2r} - \frac{G M \Delta m}{r} = -\frac{G M \Delta m}{2r}
$$

Thus, **mechanical energy per unit mass** is:
$$
\frac{E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{G M}{2r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine energy released during inward migration

The gas starts at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $, with energy per unit mass:
$$
\left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right)_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{G M}{2 R_{\text{max}}}
$$

It ends at radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, with energy per unit mass:
$$
\left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right)_{\text{final}} = -\frac{G M}{2 r}
$$

Since the gas **loses mechanical energy** as it moves inward (energy becomes more negative), the **energy released** (i.e., the amount converted to heat/radiation via viscous dissipation) is the **difference** between initial and final mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right)_{\text{initial}} - \left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right)_{\text{final}} = \left( -\frac{G M}{2 R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{G M}{2 r} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{G M}{2 r} - \frac{G M}{2 R_{\text{max}}}
$$

Now, we are told that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, or equivalently $ R_{\text{min}}/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 $, and since $ r \geq R_{\text{min}} $, we can assume $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, so:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{1}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{G M}{2 R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{G M}{2 r}
$$

Therefore, to a very good approximation:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{G M}{2 r}
$$

But wait! Let's double-check the **sign** and **interpretation**.

- The **mechanical energy decreases** (becomes more negative), so **energy is released**.
- The **amount of energy radiated/dissipated** is **positive**, equal to the **loss** in mechanical energy:
  $$
  \text{Energy released per unit mass} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = (-\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}) - (-\frac{GM}{2r}) = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
  $$

Given $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, we drop the $ 1/R_{\text{max}} $ term.

---

### Step 3: Final Answer

$$
\boxed{ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{G M}{2 r} }
$$

This is the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released (i.e., converted to heat/radiation) as the gas spirals from a large radius down to radius $ r $, under the given approximations.",0.728

- $ s $ is the initial separation at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant (assumed constant in the Steady-State model),

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In an expanding universe, even light propagation is affected by the increasing distance between source and mirror. However, in this problem, we are **not** using the standard FLRW metric or conformal time. Instead, we are told **explicitly** that the proper distance between the Solar System and the mirror evolves as:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

This is the defining feature of the **Steady-State model**, which assumes exponential expansion with constant Hubble parameter (de Sitter-like, but without a Big Bang).

But here's the key: **the mirror is not comoving**! Wait — actually, let’s read carefully:

> ""a large, fully reflecting flat mirror—carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane—would be placed at a distance $ D $ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences.""

And:

> ""Consider that the separation $ S $ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $, where $ s $ is the initial separation.""

So **both** the Solar System and the mirror are **comoving** with the Hubble flow. That is, their proper distance increases as $ D e^{H_0 t} $. The gyroscopes just keep the mirror oriented correctly; they don't prevent it from participating in cosmic expansion.

Thus, the mirror is **not fixed in proper distance**, but recedes due to expansion.

Therefore, when we send a light signal at $ t = 0 $, it must catch up to a mirror that is moving away (due to expansion), and then the reflected light must return to Earth, which is also part of the expanding frame (but we can take Earth as origin).

We need to compute the **round-trip light travel time** in this exponentially expanding universe, under the assumption that the proper distance between Earth and mirror at time $ t $ is $ D e^{H_0 t} $, **if no light were involved**. But actually, during the light’s travel, the distance is changing.

However, note: the formula $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ describes how the proper distance between two **comoving** objects evolves. But during the light propagation, we cannot assume the distance is simply that function evaluated at some time, because light doesn’t travel instantaneously.

We must calculate the **null geodesic** (path of light) in this background.

But perhaps the problem intends a **simpler approach**, using the given law directly, and treating the motion of the mirror classically: i.e., the mirror recedes with velocity $ v(t) = \frac{dS}{dt} = H_0 S(t) = H_0 D e^{H_0 t} $, and light moves at speed $ c $ relative to local space.

However, in general relativity, in an expanding universe, light always moves at speed $ c $ **locally**, but the global behavior is governed by the scale factor.

But again, the problem gives us a specific law: $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and asks us to find $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D, c, T $, using possibly the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $.

This suggests that we can treat the problem **approximately**, assuming $ H_0 D / c \ll 1 $, so that the expansion during the light travel time is small.

Let’s proceed step by step.

---

### Step 2: Set up the light travel problem

Let:
- At $ t = 0 $, a light pulse is emitted from Earth toward the mirror.
- Let $ t_1 $ be the time when the light reaches the mirror.
- During the interval $ [0, t_1] $, the mirror is moving away, so the light has to cover more than distance $ D $.
- After reflection, the light returns to Earth, arriving at time $ T $, so return trip takes $ T - t_1 $.

We need to relate $ t_1 $ and $ T $ to $ D $, $ H_0 $, and $ c $.

But how does light propagate in this model?

In a universe where proper distance between comoving points is $ a(t) \chi $, with $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the FRW metric is:

$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 d\chi^2
$$

For radial null geodesics ($ ds^2 = 0 $):

$$
c dt = a(t) d\chi \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int_{t_{\text{emit}}}^{t_{\text{obs}}} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = \Delta \chi
$$

The comoving distance $ \chi $ to the mirror is fixed (since both Earth and mirror are comoving). At $ t = 0 $, proper distance is $ D = a(0) \chi = \chi $, since $ a(0) = 1 $ (we can set normalization so that $ a(0) = 1 $).

Thus, $ \chi = D $.

**Outbound journey**: light goes from $ \chi = 0 $ to $ \chi = D $, emitted at $ t = 0 $, arrives at mirror at time $ t_1 $. Then:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = D
$$

Since $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, we have:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c \left[ \frac{1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}}{H_0} \right] = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c}
\tag{1}
$$

**Return journey**: light is reflected at $ t = t_1 $ from $ \chi = D $, and returns to $ \chi = 0 $ at time $ t = T $. So:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c \int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c \left[ \frac{e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}}{H_0} \right] = D
\tag{2}
$$

Now we have two equations (1) and (2). Let's simplify.

From (1):

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Plug into (2):

$$
c \cdot \frac{ \left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) - e^{-H_0 T} }{H_0} = D
$$

Multiply both sides by $ H_0 / c $:

$$
\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right) - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

So:

$$
1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{H_0 D}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
\tag{3}
$$

This is an exact relation (within the model) between $ H_0 $, $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $.

Now, the problem says we may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $. Since $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, we can approximate:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \cdots
$$

To first order:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T
$$

Plug into equation (3):

$$
H_0 T \approx 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ H_0 $:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Wait — that’s just the flat-space result! That can’t help us solve for $ H_0 $. That suggests we need to go to **next order** in the expansion, because the first-order correction cancels out the dependence on $ H_0 $.

Indeed, if we only use linear approximation, the effect of expansion on round-trip time is **second order**, so we must expand to second order to get a measurable effect.

Let’s do that.

Expand $ e^{-H_0 T} $ to second order:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

Similarly, in equation (1), we had:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c}
\Rightarrow
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

But to be consistent, we might also need to expand $ t_1 $ in powers of $ H_0 $, but maybe it's easier to work directly with equation (3):

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now expand left-hand side to second order:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} \approx 2 \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
\frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx T - \frac{2D}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
= \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait — in a non-expanding universe, $ T_0 = 2D/c $. So define $ \Delta T = T - T_0 = T - 2D/c $. Then:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2 \Delta T}{T^2}
$$

But the problem asks for $ H_0 $ **as a function of $ D, c, T $**. So we can write:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But is this the best form? Alternatively, we can rearrange the exact equation (3):

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

This is a **transcendental equation** for $ H_0 $. But since the problem allows the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, which is first order, but as we saw, that leads to trivial result. So perhaps the problem **intends a different interpretation**.

---

### Alternate (Simpler) Interpretation: Use Classical Doppler + Small Expansion

Maybe the problem expects a **Newtonian-like** treatment: assume that during the light’s travel, the distance increases as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \approx D(1 + H_0 t) $, and that light moves at speed $ c $ relative to Earth, while the mirror recedes at speed $ v(t) = H_0 S(t) \approx H_0 D $ (constant to first order).

This is a common approximation in introductory cosmology for small distances: recession velocity $ v = H_0 D $, treated as constant during light travel.

Let’s try this.

**Outbound trip**:

Mirror recedes at approximately constant speed $ v = H_0 D $. Light closes the distance at speed $ c - v $. So time to reach mirror:

$$
t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - v} = \frac{D}{c - H_0 D}
$$

**Return trip**:

Now, after reflection, the light returns to Earth. But during return, is Earth moving? In this frame, Earth is at rest, and the light just travels back distance ≈ $ D + v t_1 $, but actually, once reflected, the light travels at speed $ c $ toward Earth, and Earth is stationary, so the return distance is the distance at time $ t_1 $, which is $ D + v t_1 \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1) $. But to first order, we can say return time:

$$
t_2 \approx \frac{D + v t_1}{c} \approx \frac{D}{c} + \frac{v t_1}{c}
$$

But this is messy. Alternatively, use symmetry: in this classical picture, outbound time is $ D/(c - v) $, return time is $ D/(c + v) $? No — that would be if the mirror were moving away during outbound and **Earth** were moving away during return, which isn’t the case.

Actually, in radar ranging in an expanding universe, a standard approximation for small $ H_0 $ is:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Let’s derive that.

Assume that the distance to the mirror at time $ t $ is $ S(t) = D(1 + H_0 t) $ (first-order expansion of $ e^{H_0 t} $).

Light is emitted at $ t = 0 $. It reaches mirror at time $ t_1 $, having traveled a path such that:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c dt = \text{distance traveled by light} = \text{distance to mirror at time } t_1 + \text{extra due to motion}
$$

But more precisely, in a Newtonian picture, the position of the mirror is:

$$
x_m(t) = D(1 + H_0 t)
$$

Light position: $ x_{\text{light}}(t) = c t $

They meet when:

$$
c t_1 = D(1 + H_0 t_1)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c t_1 - D H_0 t_1 = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
t_1 (c - D H_0) = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
t_1 = \frac{D}{c - D H_0} \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{D H_0}{c} \right)
$$

(using $ 1/(1 - \epsilon) \approx 1 + \epsilon $)

At time $ t_1 $, mirror is at $ x = c t_1 $. Now light reflects and returns. On return, light moves toward origin: $ x_{\text{light}}(t) = c t_1 - c (t - t_1) = 2 c t_1 - c t $

It reaches Earth when $ x = 0 $, so at time $ T = 2 t_1 $

Wait — is that right? Only if Earth is stationary and light speed is isotropic, which we assume.

But actually, during return, the distance light must cover is the same as the distance it covered outbound **at the moment of reflection**, because Earth is at origin and not moving. So return time is just $ t_1' = \frac{x_m(t_1)}{c} = \frac{c t_1}{c} = t_1 $. So total time $ T = 2 t_1 $

But from above, $ t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + \frac{D H_0}{c}) $, so:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{D H_0}{c} \right ) = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{2D}{c} = \frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
= \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}
$$

But again, this is a possible answer. However, note that this model assumes mirror motion is $ x = D(1 + H_0 t) $, which comes from $ e^{H_0 t} \approx 1 + H_0 t $, and light moves at $ c $ relative to Earth.

But earlier, using the correct GR null geodesic approach, we got the exact relation:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now, if we expand **both sides** to second order in $ H_0 $, we can solve for $ H_0 $.

Left side: $ 1 - (1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \frac{(H_0 T)^3}{6} + \cdots) = H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} + \cdots $

Right side: $ 2 H_0 D / c $

So:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} \approx \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Divide by $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx \frac{2 D}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
$$

This matches what we had before.

Now, note that in the limit $ H_0 \to 0 $, $ T \to 2D/c $, as expected.

So this expression gives $ H_0 $ in terms of measurable $ T $, known $ D $, and $ c $.

But the problem says: ""Find an expression for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D, c $ and $ T $. [...] You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, if necessary.""

If we use only **first-order** approximation, we get $ T = 2D/c $, which contains no $ H_0 $, so we **must** go to second order to get a usable expression.

However, perhaps the problem expects us to **not** use the GR integral method, but rather a simpler reasoning:

Assume that during the **total time** $ T $, the distance increased from $ D $ to $ D e^{H_0 T} \approx D(1 + H_0 T) $. But the light had to travel to the mirror and back, so average distance is roughly $ D + \frac{1}{2} (D H_0 T) $, so total path length ≈ $ 2D + D H_0 T $, so travel time:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D + D H_0 T}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c T \approx 2D + D H_0 T
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c T - D H_0 T \approx 2D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
T(c - D H_0) = 2D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
c - D H_0 = \frac{2D}{T}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

Wait — this is **different** from previous result. Which one is correct?

Let’s check dimensions: $ H_0 $ has units of 1/time. $ c/D $ is 1/time, $ 2/T $ is 1/time — OK.

But sign: if universe expands, round-trip time should be **longer** than $ 2D/c $, so $ T > 2D/c \Rightarrow 2/T < c/D \Rightarrow H_0 > 0 $, which matches.

Now compare to earlier GR-based result:

We had: $ H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2} $

Write that as: $ H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \left(1 - \frac{2D}{c T} \right ) $

But since $ T \approx 2D/c $, let $ T = \frac{2D}{c}(1 + \epsilon) $, with $ \epsilon \ll 1 $. Then:

- From GR: $ H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2} = \frac{c}{D(1+\epsilon)} - \frac{c}{D(1+\epsilon)^2} \approx \frac{c}{D}(1 - \epsilon) - \frac{c}{D}(1 - 2\epsilon) = \frac{c}{D}(\epsilon) $

- From naive estimate: $ H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{c}{D(1+\epsilon)} \approx \frac{c}{D}(1 - (1 - \epsilon)) = \frac{c}{D} \epsilon $

So both give same **leading order**! So they are equivalent to first order in $ \epsilon \sim H_0 D/c $.

Thus, both approximations are consistent.

But which expression is simpler and directly in terms of $ D, c, T $?

The naive derivation gave:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

Let’s test it against the exact equation.

From exact: $ 1 - e^{-H_0 T} = 2 H_0 D / c $

Suppose $ H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T} $. For small $ H_0 $, RHS ≈ $ 2 H_0 D / c \approx 2 (1 - \frac{2D}{c T}) $

LHS: $ 1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T = (\frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}) T = \frac{c T}{D} - 2 $

Set equal: $ \frac{c T}{D} - 2 \approx 2 ( \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T} ) \frac{D}{c} = 2 (1 - \frac{2D}{c T}) $

So LHS: $ \frac{c T}{D} - 2 $, RHS: $ 2 - \frac{4D}{c T} $

These are not obviously equal. So maybe the naive derivation is flawed.

Let’s go back to the **correct GR-based exact equation**:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} \tag{A}
$$

This is the key result from integrating null geodesics in de Sitter space (which is the spacetime of Steady-State model with constant H).

Now, the problem likely expects us to **solve this equation approximately** using $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T $, but as noted, that gives $ H_0 T = 2 H_0 D / c \Rightarrow T = 2D/c $, which doesn't determine $ H_0 $.

But perhaps the problem assumes that the **distance at time of reflection** is $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $, and that light travel time each way is distance divided by c, ignoring the fact that distance changes during travel. That is, a **crude approximation**:

- Outbound time: $ t_1 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} $
- Return time: $ T - t_1 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} $ (since at reflection, distance is $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $, and assume return distance same)

Then $ T = 2 \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} $, and also $ t_1 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} = T/2 $

So $ t_1 = T/2 $, thus:

$$
\frac{T}{2} = \frac{D e^{H_0 T/2}}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
e^{H_0 T/2} = \frac{c T}{2 D}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln \left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right )
$$

This is a **nice closed-form expression**, and uses the given law $ S = D e^{H_0 t} $, evaluating the distance at time $ t = T/2 $, assuming symmetric trip.

And this makes sense: in an exponentially expanding universe, if you assume the light reaches the mirror at halfway time (which is not strictly true, but plausible for small expansion), then this holds.

Moreover, this expression **does not require approximation** and reduces to expected limit: if $ H_0 \to 0 $, then $ \ln(cT/2D) \to 0 \Rightarrow cT/2D \to 1 \Rightarrow T \to 2D/c $.

Now, if $ H_0 $ is small, we can expand the logarithm:

$$
\frac{c T}{2 D} = 1 + \delta, \quad \delta \ll 1
\Rightarrow
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \delta = \frac{2}{T} \left( \frac{c T}{2 D} - 1 \right ) = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

Which matches the naive result!

So this logarithmic expression seems **consistent and elegant**.

But is the assumption $ t_1 = T/2 $ valid?

In de Sitter space, the outbound and return trips are **not symmetric** in time, because the expansion continues during return. However, for small $ H_0 $, the asymmetry is second order, so $ t_1 \approx T/2 $ to first order.

Given that the problem is a **thought experiment** by a ""bored cosmologist"", and given the instruction to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ if necessary, but also providing the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $, I think the intended solution is the following:

- Light is emitted at $ t = 0 $.
- Mirror is at distance $ D $ at $ t = 0 $.
- Due to expansion, at time $ t $, distance is $ D e^{H_0 t} $.
- The light reaches the mirror at time $ t_1 $, so the distance traveled by light is $ c t_1 $, which equals the distance to the mirror **at time $ t_1 $** → $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} $
- Similarly, on return, light travels distance $ c (T - t_1) $, which equals the distance from mirror to Earth **at time $ t_1 $** (since after reflection, the light just needs to cover that distance, and we ignore further expansion during return? Or assume same distance)

But actually, during return, the distance continues to grow, so this is inconsistent.

However, many textbook problems use the approximation that for small velocities, the total round-trip time satisfies:

$$
c \frac{T}{2} = D e^{H_0 T/2}
$$

leading to:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln \left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right )
$$

Given that this uses the given exponential law directly, and yields a clean answer, and the problem mentions the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $, I believe this is the expected answer.

Moreover, if we apply the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, then:

From $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) \Rightarrow c t_1 - D H_0 t_1 = D \Rightarrow t_1 = D / (c - D H_0) $

Similarly, for return, if we assume the distance at reflection is $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $, and light returns at speed c, taking time $ t_2 = D e^{H_0 t_1} / c $, then total time:

$$
T = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c - D H_0} + \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c}
$$

This is messy.

Given the options, the cleanest and most consistent with the given exponential law is to use the **exact null geodesic result**:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

But this is implicit. However, the problem says ""find an expression"", not necessarily explicit. But likely wants an **explicit approximate expression**.

Given that, and that first-order expansion gives no info, but second-order does, and that the problem allows approximation, I will present the **second-order result**:

From earlier:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{H_0 D^2}{c^2} \cdot 2 \quad \text{(from classical)} 
\Rightarrow H_0 \approx \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
$$

But from GR integral, we had:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
$$

Which is correct? Let's do a consistency check with perturbation theory.

Let $ T = \frac{2D}{c} + \delta T $, with $ \delta T \ll 2D/c $

From exact equation: $ 1 - e^{-H_0 T} = 2 H_0 D / c $

Expand LHS: $ H_0 T - (H_0 T)^2/2 $

RHS: $ 2 H_0 D / c $

So: $ H_0 (T - 2D/c) = (H_0 T)^2 / 2 $

But $ T - 2D/c = \delta T $, so:

$ H_0 \delta T = (H_0 T)^2 / 2 \Rightarrow \delta T = H_0 T^2 / 2 \Rightarrow H_0 = 2 \delta T / T^2 $

So yes, $ H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} (T - 2D/c) $

This is the correct second-order approximation from the GR treatment.

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )}
$$

Alternatively, if we are allowed to give the exact implicit relation, we could write:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

But the problem asks for ""$ H_0 $ as a function of $ D, c, T $"", implying explicit.

Given that, and using the small-$ H_0 $ approximation to second order, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}
$$

This is algebraically the same as above.

So I'll go with that.

--- 

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}

26,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"We are asked to find the expression for the **gravitational wave luminosity** $ L_{\text{GW}} $ of a binary system consisting of two identical neutron stars, each of mass $ M $, orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass.

We are told:

- The system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits.
- The gravitational wave luminosity depends only on:
  - a dimensionless constant (given as $ \frac{2}{5} $),
  - the gravitational constant $ G $,
  - the speed of light $ c $,
  - the mass $ M $,
  - the orbital radius $ R $,
- Additionally, **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power** in the expression.

Our goal is to **use dimensional analysis** (plus the given information) to construct the correct formula for $ L_{\text{GW}} $, and then insert the given dimensionless constant $ \frac{2}{5} $.

---

### Step 1: Understand what luminosity means dimensionally

Luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ is **power**, i.e., energy per unit time. So its dimensions are:

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{M L^2}{T^3}
$$

In terms of fundamental dimensions (mass $M$, length $L$, time $T$):

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = M L^2 T^{-3}
$$

---

### Step 2: List dimensions of constants and variables

- $ G $: Newton's gravitational constant  
  From Newton’s law: $ F = G \frac{M^2}{R^2} $ → $ [G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} $

- $ c $: speed of light → $ [c] = L T^{-1} $

- $ M $: mass → $ [M] = M $

- $ R $: length → $ [R] = L $

We are to build an expression of the form:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) G^a c^b M^d R^e
$$

with the condition that **the exponents of $ c $ and $ R $ are equal**:  
> “$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power” ⇒ $ b = e $

So let’s denote $ b = e = x $. Then our expression becomes:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^a c^x M^d R^x
$$

Now do dimensional analysis.

---

### Step 3: Write dimensions of RHS

We compute the dimensions of $ G^a c^x M^d R^x $:

- $ [G^a] = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a = M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a} $
- $ [c^x] = (L T^{-1})^x = L^x T^{-x} $
- $ [M^d] = M^d $
- $ [R^x] = L^x $

Multiply all together:

$$
[M]:\quad -a + d \\
[L]:\quad 3a + x + x = 3a + 2x \\
[T]:\quad -2a - x
$$

This must equal the dimensions of luminosity: $ M^1 L^2 T^{-3} $

So equate exponents:

1. Mass: $ -a + d = 1 $ → $ d = a + 1 $
2. Length: $ 3a + 2x = 2 $
3. Time: $ -2a - x = -3 $ → $ 2a + x = 3 $

Now solve equations (2) and (3) for $ a $ and $ x $.

From (3): $ x = 3 - 2a $

Plug into (2):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
(-a) + 6 = 2 \\
-a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Then from (3): $ x = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 $

So:

- $ a = 4 $
- $ x = -5 $
- $ d = a + 1 = 5 $
- $ e = x = -5 $

Thus:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Or written more cleanly:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But wait! Let’s double-check this against known results.

---

### Step 4: Compare with known GR quadrupole formula

The standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary with masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $, separation $ a $ (distance between the two bodies), is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

In our case, $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, so:

- $ m_1^2 m_2^2 = M^4 $
- $ m_1 + m_2 = 2M $
- So numerator: $ M^4 \cdot 2M = 2 M^5 $
- Separation between stars: **Important!** The problem says ""circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass"".

For two equal masses, each orbits the center of mass at distance $ R $, so the **separation between the two stars is $ 2R $**.

So in the standard formula, $ a = 2R $

Therefore:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \cdot \frac{2 M^5}{(2R)^5} = \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Exactly matches our result!

✅ So our interpretation of $ R $ as the **orbital radius of each star around the center of mass** (not the separation) is consistent, and the derived formula is correct.

\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}

27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"We are given a binary system of two identical neutron stars, each of mass $ M $, orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their common center of mass. The system loses energy due to gravitational wave (GW) emission at a rate:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Our goal is to find an expression for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, the rate at which the orbital separation (more precisely, the orbital radius about the center of mass) shrinks due to this energy loss.

### Step 1: Understand the total mechanical energy of the system

In Newtonian gravity, the total mechanical energy $ E $ of a binary system in a circular orbit is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

For two bodies of mass $ M $ each, separated by distance $ a = 2R $ (since each orbits the center of mass at radius $ R $), the standard result for total orbital energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a}
$$

Here, $ M_1 = M_2 = M $, and $ a = 2R $, so:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

> **Note**: Alternatively, you can compute kinetic + potential energy directly:
> - Gravitational potential energy: $ U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R} $ (since separation is $ 2R $)
> - Each star moves in a circle of radius $ R $, with orbital speed $ v $ determined by centripetal force = gravitational force:

>   \frac{M v^2}{R} = \frac{G M^2}{(2R)^2} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M}{4 R}
>   $$
> - Total kinetic energy: $ K = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = M v^2 = \frac{G M^2}{4 R} $
> - So total energy: $ E = K + U = \frac{G M^2}{4 R} - \frac{G M^2}{2 R} = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R} $

> ✅ Confirmed.

So we take:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
$$

### Step 2: Relate energy loss to change in radius

The system loses energy via gravitational radiation, so the rate of change of orbital energy is:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

(The negative sign indicates that the system’s energy decreases as it radiates.)

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using the chain rule:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \Rightarrow \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

But also:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

Equating the two expressions:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $

Multiply both sides by $ \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
$$

Simplify:

- $ G^4 / G = G^3 $
- $ M^5 / M^2 = M^3 $
- $ R^2 / R^5 = R^{-3} $
- Numerical factor: $ 2 \cdot 4 = 8 $

So:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3} }
$$

This negative sign indicates that the orbital radius decreases over time due to gravitational wave emission, as expected.",0.49
