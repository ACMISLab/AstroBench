2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"To derive the **virial theorem** based on **Newton’s second law**, we begin by considering a system of many particles (e.g., stars in a galaxy or molecules in a gas), each of mass \( m_i \), position vector \( \mathbf{r}_i \), and subject to forces \( \mathbf{F}_i \). The goal is to relate the time-averaged kinetic energy of the system to the virial, defined as \( \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \).

---

### Step 1: Define a key quantity — the scalar moment of inertia

We start by defining the **scalar moment of inertia** of the system about the origin:

\[
I = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_i m_i r_i^2
\]

This is not the tensor moment of inertia, but a scalar useful for this derivation.

---

### Step 2: Take the second time derivative of \( I \)

We compute \( \ddot{I} = \frac{d^2 I}{dt^2} \).

First derivative:

\[
\dot{I} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right) = \sum_i m_i (2 \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i ) = 2 \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i
\]

Second derivative:

\[
\ddot{I} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 2 \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = 2 \sum_i m_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i \right)
\]

But \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{v}_i \), and \( \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = \mathbf{a}_i \), so:

\[
\ddot{I} = 2 \sum_i m_i \left( \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i \right) = 2 \sum_i m_i v_i^2 + 2 \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i
\]

---

### Step 3: Apply Newton’s second law

Newton’s second law for particle \( i \) is:

\[
m_i \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{F}_i
\]

So:

\[
m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

Therefore:

\[
\ddot{I} = 2 \sum_i m_i v_i^2 + 2 \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

Now, note that the total kinetic energy \( T \) of the system is:

\[
T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2T
\]

So:

\[
\ddot{I} = 4T + 2 \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\]

---

### Step 4: Time-average over a long period

For a **bound, stable system** (like a galaxy or a star cluster), the moment of inertia \( I \) does not grow indefinitely. Over a long time interval \( \tau \), the time average of \( \ddot{I} \) tends to zero:

\[
\left\langle \ddot{I} \right\rangle = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \ddot{I}(t)\, dt = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{\dot{I}(\tau) - \dot{I}(0)}{\tau} \to 0
\]

because \( \dot{I} \) remains bounded for a bound system.

Thus, taking the time average of both sides:

\[
0 = 4 \langle T \rangle + 2 \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

---

### Final Result: The Virial Theorem

\[
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0}
\]

Or, written in terms of the **virial** \( \mathcal{V} = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \):

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \langle \mathcal{V} \rangle = 0
\]

This is the **virial theorem** derived from Newton’s second law.

---

### Additional Note (for gravitational systems):

In a self-gravitating system (e.g., a galaxy), the force on particle \( i \) is due to gravity from all other particles:

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = - \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_{ij}, \quad \text{where } \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j
\]

It can be shown that in this case:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
\]

where \( U \) is the total gravitational potential energy (which is negative). Then the virial theorem becomes:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle - \langle U \rangle = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2T = -U \quad (\text{for time-independent systems})
\]

or total energy \( E = T + U = -T \).

But the general form derived above—based purely on Newton’s law—is:

\[
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0}

\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
$$

Swap summation order:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that the double sum includes each pair $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$. Consider the term for a fixed pair $i \ne j$:

- From $i$: contribution is $ \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $
- From $j$: contribution is $ \frac{m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $

These cancel pairwise. Hence,
$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **First integral**: **Total linear momentum is conserved**.

---

## 2. **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**

Define total angular momentum:
$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

Take time derivative:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

The first term vanishes because $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 $. So:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

Factor out constants:
$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \ne i}} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Now consider the double sum over all $i \ne j$, and split it into pairs. Use identity:
$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

Similarly, the term from $j$ gives:
$$
\mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

So the combined contribution from pair $(i,j)$ is:
$$
-G m_i m_j \left[ \frac{-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j}{r_{ij}^3} + \frac{\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j}{r_{ij}^3} \right] = 0.
$$

Thus, $\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0$, so:

✅ **Second integral**: **Total angular momentum is conserved**.

---

## 3. **Conservation of Total Mechanical Energy**

Define kinetic energy:
$$
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2.
$$

Potential energy (gravitational) for N-body system:
$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

The factor $1/2$ avoids double-counting pairs.

Total energy: $ E = T + U $.

Take time derivative:
$$
\dot{E} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \frac{dU}{dt}.
$$

Compute $ \frac{dU}{dt} $. Since $ U $ depends only on positions:
$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i,
$$
where $ \nabla_i U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} $.

From expression for $U$, compute gradient:
$$
\nabla_i U = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

But this is exactly the force on particle $i$: $ \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \nabla_i U $.

Wait! Actually, **force is negative gradient of potential**: $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $. Let's verify:

Given $ U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} $, then
$$
\nabla_i U = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{F}_i.
$$

But in Newton’s law: $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $? Wait—sign check:

Actually, **gravitational potential energy** is **negative**, and force is **attractive**, so:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U.
$$

Let’s recompute carefully:

If $ U = -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} $, then
$$
\nabla_i U = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{F}_i.
$$

But from Newton’s law: $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i $. So indeed $ \mathbf{F}_i = \nabla_i U $, which implies **our definition of U already includes the correct sign**.

But standard convention is $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $, so to be consistent, define:
$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla_i U = +\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\mathbf{F}_i.
$$

Yes! So correct relation: $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $.

Therefore, $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\nabla_i U $.

Now compute:
$$
\dot{E} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_i \nabla_i U \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_i \left( m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \nabla_i U \right) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0,
$$
since $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\nabla_i U $.

Thus, $ \dot{E} = 0 \Rightarrow E = \text{constant} $.

✅ **Third integral**: **Total mechanical energy is conserved**.

## Summary: First Integrals of Motion

For an isolated N-body system governed by Newtonian gravity:

1. **Total linear momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const.}
   $$

2. **Total angular momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{const.}
   $$

3. **Total mechanical energy**:  
   $$
   E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{const.}
   $$

These are the **classical first integrals** arising from the symmetries of the system:
- Homogeneity of space → conservation of linear momentum,
- Isotropy of space → conservation of angular momentum,
- Time-translation invariance → conservation of energy.

> Note: For $ N \geq 3 $, the system is generally **not integrable** (no additional independent integrals beyond these 10: 3 for $\mathbf{P}$, 3 for $\mathbf{L}$, 1 for $E$, and 3 for center-of-mass motion — see below).

---

## Bonus: Center-of-Mass Motion

Define total mass: $ M = \sum_i m_i $, and center of mass:
$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i.
$$

Then:
$$
M \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \sum_i m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} = 0,
$$
so $ \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0 \Rightarrow \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \text{const.} $

This is actually **equivalent to conservation of total linear momentum**, since $ \mathbf{P} = M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} $.

Integrating once more: $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t $ — this gives **3 additional trivial integrals** (initial CM position and velocity), but they are not independent of $\mathbf{P}$.

In total, the N-body problem has **10 classical integrals** (for $N \geq 2$):
- 3 components of $\mathbf{P}$,
- 3 components of $\mathbf{L}$,
- 1 energy $E$,
- 3 components of $\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t=0)$ or equivalently initial CM position (often counted when considering absolute coordinates).

But strictly speaking, the **non-trivial first integrals** derived directly from dynamics are **$\mathbf{P}, \mathbf{L}, E$**.

✅ **Final Answer**: The first integrals of motion are conservation of total linear momentum, total angular momentum, and total mechanical energy, as derived above.",0.714

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

From the vis-viva equation  $v=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"To prove the expressions for the velocities at **aphelion** and **perihelion** for a celestial body in an **elliptical orbit**, we will use two fundamental principles of orbital mechanics:

1. **Conservation of angular momentum**
2. **Vis-viva equation**

We are to show that:
- Velocity at **aphelion**:  
  $$
  v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
  $$
- Velocity at **perihelion**:  
  $$
  v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
  $$

Where:
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ is the standard gravitational parameter (for $ M \gg m $),
- $ a $ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $ e $ is the eccentricity ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipses).

---

### Step 1: Recall key orbital geometry

For an elliptical orbit:
- **Perihelion distance** (closest approach):  
  $$
  r_P = a(1 - e)
  $$
- **Aphelion distance** (farthest point):  
  $$
  r_A = a(1 + e)
  $$

These come from the general polar form of a conic section:
$$
r(\theta) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$
At perihelion, $ \theta = 0 \Rightarrow r_P = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e} = a(1 - e) $  
At aphelion, $ \theta = \pi \Rightarrow r_A = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1 + e) $

---

### Step 2: Use the vis-viva equation

The **vis-viva equation** relates the speed $ v $ of an object in orbit to its distance $ r $ from the central body:

$$
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

This is derived from conservation of mechanical energy in a Keplerian orbit.

#### Apply to perihelion:

At perihelion, $ r = r_P = a(1 - e) $. So:

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Thus:
$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression for $ v_P $.

#### Apply to aphelion:

At aphelion, $ r = r_A = a(1 + e) $. So:

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Thus:
$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression for $ v_A $.

---

### Alternative approach: Conservation of angular momentum

At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity vector is **perpendicular** to the radius vector (since these are turning points in radial motion), so angular momentum per unit mass is:

$$
h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$

Using $ r_P = a(1 - e) $, $ r_A = a(1 + e) $, we get:

$$
a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow \frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

This ratio is consistent with the expressions above:
$$
\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{ \sqrt{(1 + e)/(1 - e)} }{ \sqrt{(1 - e)/(1 + e)} } = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

So both energy and angular momentum approaches confirm the result.

---

### Final Answer:

We have proven using the **vis-viva equation** (conservation of energy) that for a body in an elliptical orbit:

$$
\boxed{
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}
$$

These are the speeds at **aphelion** and **perihelion**, respectively.",0.546
10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

We are to find the orbital period $ P $ of the satellite as a function of $ d $, $ R $, and $ \rho $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

Because the planet is **very long**, we can model it as an **infinitely long uniform cylinder**. This is a standard approximation in physics when dealing with very long symmetric objects — edge effects are neglected, and the gravitational (or electric) field becomes **independent of position along the axis** and depends only on the radial distance from the axis.

For an **infinitely long cylinder** with uniform mass per unit length $ \lambda $, the gravitational field at a radial distance $ r $ from the axis (outside the cylinder, i.e., $ r > R $) is:

$$
g(r) = \frac{2G\lambda}{r}
$$

This result comes from applying **Gauss's law for gravity** in cylindrical symmetry.

> **Gauss’s Law for Gravity (integral form):**
> $$
> \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
> $$
> For a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $ r $ and length $ L $, the left-hand side becomes $ g(r) \cdot (2\pi r L) $, and the enclosed mass is $ M_{\text{enc}} = \lambda L $. So:
> $$
> g(r)(2\pi r L) = -4\pi G (\lambda L) \Rightarrow g(r) = -\frac{2G\lambda}{r}
> $$
> The negative sign indicates direction toward the axis; we’ll work with magnitudes unless direction matters.

---

### Step 2: Express $ \lambda $ in Terms of Given Quantities

We are given **density** $ \rho $ (mass per unit volume) and radius $ R $. For a cylinder of radius $ R $, the mass per unit length is:

$$
\lambda = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
$$

So the gravitational field at distance $ d > R $ is:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2G \rho \pi R^2}{d}
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply Circular Motion Condition

Assume the satellite is in a **circular orbit** around the cylinder, in a plane **perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis**, at radial distance $ d $ (from the central axis). This is the natural orbital plane due to symmetry.

For a circular orbit, the required centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = g(d) = \frac{2G \rho \pi R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $:

$$
v^2 = 2G \rho \pi R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital **speed is constant**, independent of orbital radius $ d $ (as long as $ d \geq R $). This is analogous to the ""flat rotation curves"" seen in galaxies.

---

### Step 4: Relate Speed to Orbital Period

The orbital period $ P $ is the time to complete one circumference:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

Now plug in $ v = \sqrt{2G \rho \pi R^2} $:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2G \rho \pi R^2}} = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho} \cdot R}
$$

Simplify:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} \cdot d
$$

Or more neatly:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\, d}{R \sqrt{G \rho}}}
$$

Alternatively, rationalizing constants:

$$
P = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{1}{R}
$$

So the final expression is:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}
$$

✅ This is the desired relation between the orbital period $ P $, the orbital radius $ d $, the cylinder radius $ R $, and the density $ \rho $.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}
$$

This shows that **the period is directly proportional to the orbital distance $ d $** — unlike Kepler’s third law for spherical masses (where $ P^2 \propto d^3 $), the cylindrical geometry gives a linear relationship.",0.637

---

### **Given:**

- Both galaxies have radius $ R $.
- **Galaxy A**: Spiral galaxy; at distance $ R $ from center, **rotational velocity** is $ v $.
- **Galaxy B**: Spherical, elliptical galaxy composed of uniformly and evenly spaced stars; at distance $ R $, **radial velocity dispersion** is $ v $.

We are to find the **masses** $ M_A $ and $ M_B $ of the two galaxies.

---

## **Part 1: Mass of Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)**

For a spiral galaxy, mass can be estimated using **circular velocity** under the assumption that stars orbit in circular paths due to gravitational force from the enclosed mass.

The centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M_A}{R^2}
$$

Solving for $ M_A $:

$$
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
$$

✅ This is the standard **rotation curve mass estimator** for a spiral galaxy, assuming all mass is interior to radius $ R $ (or that the mass distribution is such that the enclosed mass dominates).

---

## **Part 2: Mass of Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)**

Elliptical galaxies do not rotate significantly; their support against gravity comes from **random stellar motions**, characterized by **velocity dispersion**. To relate velocity dispersion to mass, we use the **virial theorem**.

### **Virial Theorem Approach**

The virial theorem states:

$$
2K + U = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2K = -U
$$

Where:
- $ K $ is the total kinetic energy,
- $ U $ is the gravitational potential energy.

For a spherical system with **radial velocity dispersion** $ \sigma_r = v $, the total kinetic energy is:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle
$$

But note: in a 3D isotropic system, the total velocity dispersion squared is:

$$
\langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2 = 3v^2
$$

So:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B (3v^2) = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2
$$

Now, the gravitational potential energy $ U $ for a **uniform sphere** of mass $ M_B $ and radius $ R $ is:

$$
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$

(Important: this assumes **uniform density**, which matches the problem statement: “composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars” → uniform mass distribution.)

Apply virial theorem:

$$
2K = -U \Rightarrow 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$

Simplify left side:

$$
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$

Cancel $ 3 $ and one $ M_B $ from both sides (assuming $ M_B \ne 0 $):

$$
v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}
$$

Solve for $ M_B $:

$$
M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
$$

✅ So the mass of the elliptical galaxy is **5 times larger** than that of the spiral galaxy with the same characteristic speed $ v $ at radius $ R $.

---

## **Final Answers:**

- **Mass of Galaxy A (spiral):**  
  $$
  M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
  $$

- **Mass of Galaxy B (elliptical, uniform sphere):**  
  $$
  M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
  $$

These results reflect the different dynamical support mechanisms: ordered rotation vs. random motions, and the effect of mass distribution on potential energy.",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure.

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"We are asked to find the **density** of a white dwarf in terms of its total mass $ M $, and the atomic number $ Z $ and mass number $ A $ of its constituent nuclei, using the balance between **electron degeneracy pressure** and **gravitational pressure**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

- A white dwarf is supported against gravitational collapse by **electron degeneracy pressure**.
- The star is composed of fully ionized atoms: each nucleus has:
  - Charge $ +Ze $ (so contributes $ Z $ electrons),
  - Mass approximately $ A m_p $, where $ m_p $ is the proton mass (we’ll assume neutron and proton masses are approximately equal, so nuclear mass ≈ $ A m_p $).
- Total mass of star: $ M $
- Radius: $ R $
- Volume: $ V = \frac{4}{pi}?? Wait—actually $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $
- We are to find **mass density** $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} $

But we will derive $ \rho $ in terms of $ M $, $ A $, $ Z $, and constants, using **pressure balance**:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}|
$$

Note: Gravitational ""pressure"" here is defined as $ p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V} $, and since $ \Omega < 0 $, this gives a positive inward pressure magnitude.

Given:
- Electron degeneracy pressure:
  $$
  p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
  $$
- Gravitational potential energy:
  $$
  \Omega = -\frac{3 G M^2}{5 R}
  \Rightarrow p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V}
  $$

Since $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $, then:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

So equilibrium condition:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4} \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate electron number density $ n $ to mass density $ \rho $

Let’s find $ n $, the **electron number density**, in terms of total mass $ M $, and $ A, Z $.

- Total number of nucleons in star: $ \frac{M}{m_p} $ (since each nucleon ~ mass $ m_p $)
- Number of nuclei: $ N_{\text{nuc}} = \frac{M}{A m_p} $
- Each nucleus contributes $ Z $ electrons ⇒ total number of electrons:
  $$
  N_e = Z \cdot N_{\text{nuc}} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p}
  $$
- Volume: $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $
- So electron number density:
  $$
  n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p R^3} \tag{2}
  $$

Also, mass density:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{3 M}{4 \pi R^3} \Rightarrow R^3 = \frac{3 M}{4 \pi \rho} \tag{3}
$$

We aim to find $ \rho $ as function of $ M, A, Z $, etc. So ultimately eliminate $ R $ and $ n $, and solve for $ \rho $.

---

### Step 3: Plug $ n $ from (2) into pressure balance (1)

First, compute $ n^{5/3} $:

$$
n = \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p R^3} \Rightarrow n^{5/3} = \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \cdot R^{-5}
$$

Because $ (R^3)^{-5/3} = R^{-5} $

Now left-hand side of (1):

$$
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5}
$$

Right-hand side of (1):

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

So equate:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ R^5 $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi} R
$$

Now solve for $ R $:

$$
R = \frac{20 \pi \hbar^2}{5 m_e \cdot 3 G M^2} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Simplify constants:

- $ \frac{20\pi}{5 \cdot 3} = \frac{4\pi}{3} $

So:

$$
R = \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G M^2} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \tag{4}
$$

Now recall that $ \rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} $. So compute $ R^3 $ from (4), then invert.

Let’s write (4) as:

$$
R = K \cdot M^{-2} \cdot M^{5/3} = K \cdot M^{-1/3}
$$

where $ K $ collects all constants and $ Z, A $ dependence.

Indeed:

- $ \left( \frac{3 Z M}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} $
- So overall $ R \propto M^{-2} \cdot M^{5/3} = M^{-1/3} $

Thus $ R \propto M^{-1/3} \Rightarrow R^3 \propto M^{-1} \Rightarrow \rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \propto M / (M^{-1}) = M^2 $

Wait—that suggests $ \rho \propto M^2 $, which is a known result for non-relativistic white dwarfs.

But we need **explicit expression** for $ \rho $.

---

### Step 4: Compute $ \rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} $ using expression for $ R $

From (4):

$$
R = \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G M^2} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3}
$$

Combine $ M $ powers: $ M^{-2} \cdot M^{5/3} = M^{-1/3} $, so:

$$
R = \underbrace{ \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} }_{\mathcal{C}} \cdot M^{-1/3}
$$

Then:

$$
R^3 = \mathcal{C}^3 \cdot M^{-1}
\Rightarrow \rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi \mathcal{C}^3 M^{-1}} = \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi \mathcal{C}^3}
$$

So now compute $ \mathcal{C}^3 $:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Take cube:

$$
\mathcal{C}^3 = \left( \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} \right)^3 \cdot (3\pi^2)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^5
$$

Because:
- $ [(3\pi^2)^{2/3}]^3 = (3\pi^2)^2 $
- $ [(\cdots)^{5/3}]^3 = (\cdots)^5 $

Now plug into $ \rho $:

$$
\rho = \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi} \cdot \left[ \left( \frac{4\pi \hbar^2}{3 m_e G} \right)^3 (3\pi^2)^2 \left( \frac{3 Z}{4 \pi A m_p} \right)^5 \right]^{-1}
$$

So:

$$
\rho = \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{4 \pi A m_p}{3 Z} \right)^5
$$

Now combine all constants. Let's group terms:

- Powers of $ \pi $:
  - From $ \frac{3}{4\pi} $
  - From $ (4\pi)^{-3} $ in denominator → becomes $ (4\pi)^3 $ in numerator after inversion? Wait, let's be careful.

Actually, write step-by-step:

$$
\rho = \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2} \cdot \left( \frac{4 \pi A m_p}{3 Z} \right)^5
$$

Now expand each factor:

1. $ \left( \frac{3 m_e G}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 = \frac{27 m_e^3 G^3}{64 \pi^3 \hbar^6} $
2. $ \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2} = \frac{1}{9 \pi^4} $
3. $ \left( \frac{4 \pi A m_p}{3 Z} \right)^5 = \frac{1024 \pi^5 A^5 m_p^5}{243 Z^5} $ (since $ 4^5 = 1024 $, $ 3^5 = 243 $)

Now multiply all together with $ \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi} $:

$$
\rho = \frac{3 M^2}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{27 m_e^3 G^3}{64 \pi^3 \hbar^6} \cdot \frac{1}{9 \pi^4} \cdot \frac{1024 \pi^5 A^5 m_p^5}{243 Z^5}
$$

Now simplify constants and powers of $ \pi $:

- Numerical constants:
  - Numerator: $ 3 \cdot 27 \cdot 1024 $
  - Denominator: $ 4 \cdot 64 \cdot 9 \cdot 243 $

Compute step by step:

- $ 3 \cdot 27 = 81 $
- $ 81 \cdot 1024 = 82944 $

Denominator:
- $ 4 \cdot 64 = 256 $
- $ 9 \cdot 243 = 2187 $
- $ 256 \cdot 2187 = ? $

Compute:  
$ 2000 \cdot 256 = 512,000 $  
$ 187 \cdot 256 = (180+7)*256 = 180*256 + 7*256 = 46080 + 1792 = 47872 $  
Total: $ 512,000 + 47,872 = 559,872 $

So numerical factor: $ \frac{82944}{559872} $

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 82944:

- $ 559872 ÷ 82944 = 6.75 $? Wait, better use GCD.

Note: 82944 × 6 = 497,664  
82944 × 6.75 = 82944 × (27/4) = (82944/4)*27 = 20736*27 = 559,872 — yes!

So $ \frac{82944}{559872} = \frac{1}{6.75} = \frac{4}{27} $

Check: $ 82944 × 27 = ? $, $ 559872 × 4 = 2,239,488 $ — maybe another way.

Alternatively, factor:

- 82944 = 27 × 1024 × 3 = 3^3 × 2^{10} × 3 = 3^4 × 2^{10}
- 559872 = 4 × 64 × 9 × 243 = (2^2) × (2^6) × (3^2) × (3^5) = 2^8 × 3^7

Now numerator: 3 × 27 × 1024 = 3 × 3^3 × 2^{10} = 3^4 × 2^{10}

Denominator: 4π part already accounted; constants: 4 × 64 × 9 × 243 = 2^2 × 2^6 × 3^2 × 3^5 = 2^8 × 3^7

So constant factor = $ \frac{3^4 \cdot 2^{10}}{2^8 \cdot 3^7} = \frac{2^2}{3^3} = \frac{4}{27} $

✅ Good!

Now powers of $ \pi $:

- From $ \frac{1}{4\pi} $ → $ \pi^{-1} $
- From $ \frac{1}{\pi^3} $ → $ \pi^{-3} $
- From $ \frac{1}{\pi^4} $ → $ \pi^{-4} $
- From $ \pi^5 $ in numerator

Total: $ \pi^{-1 -3 -4 +5} = \pi^{-3} $

So overall:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27} \cdot \frac{M^2}{\pi^3} \cdot \frac{m_e^3 G^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot A^5 m_p^5 \cdot \frac{1}{Z^5}
$$

Wait, check: we had $ m_e^3 G^3 / \hbar^6 $, and $ A^5 m_p^5 / Z^5 $

Yes.

So final expression:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{A^5}{Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

But recall: this is **mass density**, and it scales as $ M^2 $, as expected for non-relativistic white dwarfs.

However, the problem asks: **""what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass M, A, Z, and other fundamental constants?""**

So we can present the answer as:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

Or expanded:

$$
\rho = \frac{4 G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{27 \pi^3 \hbar^6} \cdot \frac{A^5}{Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

This is the desired relation.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4 G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{27 \pi^3 \hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
}
$$

This gives the **mass density** of a non-relativistic white dwarf in terms of its mass $ M $, the mass number $ A $ and atomic number $ Z $ of its ions, and fundamental constants $ G, m_e, m_p, \hbar $.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $U_{\text{int}}$ of the interaction between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$?","According to: 

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

Conclude:

---

### **Step 1: Magnetic field due to a dipole**

The magnetic field produced by a dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at position $ \vec{r} $ is:

$$
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
$$

This is the standard expression for the magnetic field of a point dipole in vacuum.

---

### **Step 2: Potential energy of a dipole in an external field**

The potential energy of a dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ placed in an external magnetic field $ \vec{B}_1 $ is:

$$
U = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1
$$

So, substituting the expression for $ \vec{B}_1 $:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

We can factor out the constants:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Now distribute the dot product:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Rewriting:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]
$$

This is the standard form of the **magnetic dipole–dipole interaction energy**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]
}

This expression gives the classical interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles separated by distance $ r $, with unit vector $ \hat{r} $ pointing from one to the other.

$E_{\text{Total}} = V + K = -\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r} + \frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r} = -\frac{e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r}.$

The orbital momentum is

$L = m_{e}vr.$",No,"We are asked to find the **total energy** and **orbital angular momentum** of an electron orbiting a proton under Coulomb attraction, assuming:

- The proton is much heavier than the electron: \( m_p \gg m_e \), so we can treat the proton as **stationary** (i.e., the electron orbits around a fixed center).
- Only Coulombic (electrostatic) attraction acts between them.
- The orbit is **circular** (implied by asking for orbital momentum in a classical context without specifying otherwise).

We'll solve this using **classical mechanics**, not quantum mechanics (since no mention of quantization or Bohr model is made, though the setup resembles it).

---

### Step 1: Coulomb Force Provides Centripetal Force

For a circular orbit of radius \( r \), the Coulomb attraction provides the necessary centripetal force:

\[
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \) is Coulomb's constant,
- \( e \) is the elementary charge (magnitude),
- \( v \) is the orbital speed of the electron.

Multiply both sides by \( r \):

\[
\frac{k e^2}{r} = m_e v^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}
\tag{1}
\]

---

### Step 2: Total Energy

Total mechanical energy \( E \) is the sum of kinetic and potential energy:

\[
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{k e^2}{r}
\]

Substitute \( v^2 \) from Equation (1):

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} m_e \left( \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \right) - \frac{k e^2}{r}
= \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r}
= -\frac{k e^2}{2r}
\]

✅ So the **total energy** is:

\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{2r}}
\]

(You may leave it as \( -\frac{k e^2}{2r} \) if preferred.)

---

### Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum

Orbital angular momentum \( L \) for circular motion is:

\[
L = m_e v r
\]

We already have \( v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \), so:

\[
L = m_e r \sqrt{ \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} }
= m_e r \sqrt{ \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} }
= \sqrt{ m_e r^2 \cdot \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} }
= \sqrt{ k e^2 m_e r }
\]

✅ So the **orbital angular momentum** is:

\[
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 m_e r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }}
\]

(Again, using \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \), so \( k e^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \).)

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy**:  
  \[
  E = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{2r}
  \]

- **Orbital angular momentum**:  
  \[
  L = \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 m_e r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
  \]

These are classical expressions under the assumption \( m_p \gg m_e \), so the proton is fixed at the center.",0.637

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"We are given a scenario involving a meteorite colliding with a space station in circular orbit around Earth, and after the collision they form a conglomerate that moves in a **closed orbit** (i.e., an ellipse) with **perigee (closest approach)** equal to **R/2**, where R is the original orbital radius of the space station.

We are to find:

1. The speed of the meteorite just before collision,
2. The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
3. The maximum distance (apogee) of the conglomerate from Earth's center,
4. A condition on masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ for this to be possible.

We are to express everything in terms of:
- Earth mass $ M $
- Gravitational constant $ G $
- Meteorite mass $ m_1 $
- Space station mass $ m_2 $

Assume:
- The meteorite is **radially approaching** Earth → its velocity is purely radial (no tangential component).
- The space station is in **circular orbit** of radius $ R $ → its velocity is purely tangential.
- Collision is **perfectly inelastic**: they stick together.
- After collision, total mass = $ m_1 + m_2 $
- Gravitational field is due only to Earth (ignore mutual gravity between meteorite/station).
- Earth is fixed (infinite mass approximation), so we work in Earth-centered inertial frame.

### Step 0: Useful Quantities

**Circular orbit speed of space station:**

For circular orbit of radius $ R $, centripetal force = gravity:

$$
\frac{m_2 v_0^2}{R} = \frac{G M m_2}{R^2} \Rightarrow v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}
$$

So, just before collision:
- Space station velocity: $ \vec{v}_2 = v_0 \hat{\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}} \, \hat{\theta} $
- Meteorite velocity: $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{r} $ (radially inward; magnitude $ v_1 $ unknown)

After collision:
- Combined mass: $ m = m_1 + m_2 $
- Velocity: $ \vec{V} = \frac{m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2} $

This post-collision motion is a **Keplerian orbit** under Earth’s gravity, with known perigee $ r_{\min} = R/2 $. Since it's a closed orbit, it must be an **ellipse**.

We'll use conservation of **angular momentum** and **mechanical energy** for the post-collision orbit.

---

## Part (i): Find speed $ v_1 $ of meteorite just before collision

We will use two facts:

1. **Angular momentum** of conglomerate immediately after collision = angular momentum of resulting elliptical orbit at perigee or apogee.
2. **Energy** of conglomerate after collision = specific orbital energy of ellipse.

But better: compute angular momentum and energy **right after collision**, then relate to orbital parameters using known perigee = $ R/2 $.

Let’s define:

- Position at collision: $ r = R $ (since space station is at radius R)
- So, the conglomerate starts its new orbit at radius $ R $, with velocity $ \vec{V} $ as above.

From this point, it follows an elliptical orbit with **perigee = R/2**. Note: since perigee < R, and the object is at r = R at some point in orbit, then **R must be greater than perigee**, so the collision point is **not** at perigee—it could be at apogee or somewhere in between.

But wait! The problem says: “the conglomerate moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2.” That means **perigee = R/2**, but doesn't say where the collision occurs along the orbit.

However, **collision occurs at r = R**, so the post-collision orbit passes through r = R, and has perigee = R/2. So r = R is **not** the perigee; it could be apogee or intermediate point.

But we can determine the orbit fully if we know **energy** and **angular momentum** after collision. Then we can impose that the **minimum radial distance** (perigee) is R/2.

So plan:

- Compute angular momentum $ L $ and energy $ E $ of conglomerate just after collision (in terms of $ v_1 $).
- For a Keplerian orbit, perigee $ r_p = \frac{L^2 / (G M m^2)}{1 + e} $, or better use formula relating $ r_p $, $ r_a $, energy, and angular momentum.
- Use known relation: for elliptical orbit,
  $$
  r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e)
  $$
  and specific angular momentum $ h = |\vec{r} \times \vec{v}| = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)} $
- Also, specific mechanical energy: $ \epsilon = -\frac{G M}{2a} $

But perhaps easiest: use **conservation of angular momentum and energy**, and the fact that at **perigee**, radial velocity = 0, and distance = R/2.

But we don’t know velocity at perigee yet. Alternative method:

Use the **orbit equation**:

$$
r(\theta) = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

Perigee occurs at $ \theta = 0 $, so:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e} = \frac{R}{2}
$$

Also, at the moment of collision (at r = R), the position and velocity are known in terms of $ v_1 $, so we can compute **specific angular momentum** $ h = |\vec{r} \times \vec{v}| $, and **specific energy** $ \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} v^2 - \frac{G M}{r} $

Then use the identity:

$$
e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \epsilon h^2}{(G M)^2}}
$$

Then plug into perigee formula.

Let’s do that.

### Compute post-collision velocity

At collision:

- Position vector: $ \vec{r} = R \hat{r} $
- Meteorite velocity: $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{r} $
- Space station velocity: $ \vec{v}_2 = v_0 \hat{\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}} \hat{\theta} $

Total momentum: $ \vec{p} = m_1 (-v_1 \hat{r}) + m_2 v_0 \hat{\theta} $

Total mass: $ m = m_1 + m_2 $

So post-collision velocity:

$$
\vec{V} = \frac{-m_1 v_1}{m} \hat{r} + \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \hat{\theta}
$$

So speed squared:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \right)^2
$$

Specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit total mass):

$$
\vec{h} = \vec{r} \times \vec{V} = R \hat{r} \times \left( -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \hat{r} + \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \hat{\theta} \right) = R \cdot \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} (\hat{r} \times \hat{\theta}) = R \cdot \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \hat{z}
$$

So magnitude:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m} R v_0 = \frac{m_2}{m} R \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R}
$$

Specific mechanical energy:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{G M}{R} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_0}{m} \right)^2 \right] - \frac{G M}{R}
$$

Recall $ v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} $, so:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{G M}{R}}{m^2} \right) - \frac{G M}{R}
= \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{2 m^2} + \frac{m_2^2 G M}{2 m^2 R} - \frac{G M}{R}
$$

Now, eccentricity:

$$
e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \epsilon h^2}{(G M)^2}}
$$

Compute $ h^2 $:

$$
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 G M R
$$

Now compute $ 2 \epsilon h^2 $:

First, write $ \epsilon = A + B $, where:

- $ A = \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{2 m^2} $
- $ B = \frac{m_2^2 G M}{2 m^2 R} - \frac{G M}{R} = \frac{G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2 m^2} - 1 \right) $

Then:

$$
2 \epsilon h^2 = 2 (A + B) h^2 = 2 A h^2 + 2 B h^2
$$

Compute each term:

- $ 2 A h^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{2 m^2} \cdot \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} G M R \right) = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 G M R}{m^4} $
- $ 2 B h^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2 m^2} - 1 \right) \cdot \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} G M R \right) = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2 m^2} - 1 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} (G M)^2 $

Simplify:

$$
2 B h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} (G M)^2
$$

So total:

$$
2 \epsilon h^2 = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 G M R}{m^4} + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} (G M)^2
$$

Now divide by $ (G M)^2 $:

$$
\frac{2 \epsilon h^2}{(G M)^2} = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}
$$

Thus,

$$
e = \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} }
$$

Simplify the constant terms:

Let’s compute:

$$
1 + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = 1 + \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = \left(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}{m^2} \right)? Wait, check:

Actually:

$$
1 - 2x + x^2 = (1 - x)^2, \quad \text{where } x = \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}
$$

But $ 1 - x = 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = \frac{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} $

So yes:

$$
1 + \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = \left(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m^2} \right)^2? Wait, no:

Wait: $ (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 $, so:

$$
1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = \frac{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}{m^2} = \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m^2}
$$

So square is:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m^2} \right)^2
$$

But maybe keep as $ (1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2})^2 $ for now.

So finally:

$$
e = \sqrt{ \left(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right)^2 + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} }
$$

Now, recall perigee distance:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e} = \frac{ \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} G M R \right) / (G M) }{1 + e} = \frac{ \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} R }{1 + e }
$$

Set this equal to $ R/2 $:

$$
\frac{ \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} R }{1 + e } = \frac{R}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{m_2^2}{m^2 (1 + e)} = \frac{1}{2}
\Rightarrow 1 + e = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}
\Rightarrow e = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1
$$

Note: for physical orbit, $ 0 \le e < 1 $ (since closed orbit). So this implies:

$$
0 \le 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 < 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \le \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} < 1
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow m_2 \ge \frac{m_1 + m_2}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow m_2 (1 - 1/\sqrt{2}) \ge m_1 / \sqrt{2}
$$

We’ll come back to this as the **condition**.

Now, equate this expression for $ e $ with the earlier one:

$$
e = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 = \sqrt{ \left(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right)^2 + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} }
$$

Square both sides:

Left side squared:

$$
\left( 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 4 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 1
$$

Right side:

$$
\left(1 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} \right)^2 + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M}
$$

Set equal:

$$
4 \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 4 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 1 = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} + \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M}
$$

Cancel 1 on both sides, bring all terms to left:

$$
4 \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 4 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
(4 - 1) \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} + (-4 + 2) \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M} = 0
\Rightarrow 3 \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ m^4 G M $:

$$
3 m_2^4 G M - 2 m_2^2 m^2 G M = m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R
$$

Divide both sides by $ m_2^2 $ (assuming $ m_2 \ne 0 $):

$$
3 m_2^2 G M - 2 m^2 G M = m_1^2 v_1^2 R
$$

Recall $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, so $ m^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 $

So:

$$
3 m_2^2 G M - 2 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) G M = m_1^2 v_1^2 R
$$

Compute left:

$$
[3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2] G M = [m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2] G M
$$

So:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 R = (m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2) G M
$$

Wait — this could be negative! But left side is positive ⇒ right side must be positive.

So:

$$
m_2^2 > 2 m_1^2 + 4 m_1 m_2
$$

But this seems too restrictive. Did we make sign error?

Let’s double-check the algebra.

Go back to:

$$
3 \cdot \frac{m_2^4}{m^4} - 2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{m^4 G M}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ m^4 $:

$$
3 m_2^4 - 2 m_2^2 m^2 = \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{G M}
$$

Yes.

Now, note that $ m^2 = (m_1 + m_2)^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 $

So:

$$
3 m_2^4 - 2 m_2^2 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 3 m_2^4 - 2 m_2^2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2^3 - 2 m_2^4 = (3 - 2) m_2^4 - 2 m_1^2 m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2^3 = m_2^4 - 2 m_1^2 m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2^3
$$

Factor $ m_2^2 $:

$$
m_2^2 (m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 v_1^2 R}{G M} = m_2^2 (m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2)
\Rightarrow \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 R}{G M} = m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2
$$

Thus:

$$
v_1^2 = \frac{G M}{m_1^2 R} (m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2)
$$

For $ v_1^2 > 0 $, need:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
$$

Treat as quadratic in $ m_2 $:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
\Rightarrow m_2 > m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6}) \quad \text{(positive root)}
$$

But this seems very large. Is this reasonable?

Wait—maybe our assumption about direction of meteorite velocity is causing issues. But more likely: **we made a wrong assumption about the location of perigee**.

Alternative approach: **Use conservation of angular momentum and energy directly with perigee condition**.

At perigee (r = R/2), radial velocity = 0, so velocity is purely tangential: $ v_p $

Then:

- Angular momentum: $ L = (m_1 + m_2) (R/2) v_p $
- Energy: $ E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_p^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R/2} = (m_1 + m_2) \left( \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{2 G M}{R} \right) $

But also, right after collision (at r = R), we have:

- Angular momentum: $ L = m_2 R v_0 = m_2 R \sqrt{G M / R} = m_2 \sqrt{G M R} $ (since meteorite has no angular momentum)
- Energy: $ E = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_0^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R} $

Wait! Important point: **Gravitational potential energy depends on total mass**, but kinetic energy is sum of individual KEs **before collision**. However, **after collision**, we consider the conglomerate as single object with mass $ m_1 + m_2 $, so total mechanical energy **after collision** is:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) V^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R}
$$

But this is **not equal** to sum of energies before collision, because collision is inelastic (kinetic energy not conserved). However, **momentum is conserved**, so velocity V is as computed.

But for orbital motion **after collision**, we only care about **post-collision** energy and angular momentum.

However, note: **angular momentum is conserved during collision**, because internal forces. And gravitational torque is zero at instant of collision (central force). So total angular momentum just after = just before.

Before collision:

- Meteorite: radial motion → angular momentum = 0
- Space station: $ L = m_2 R v_0 = m_2 \sqrt{G M R} $

So **total angular momentum after collision**: $ L = m_2 \sqrt{G M R} $

This is **independent of m1**! Good.

Similarly, total energy after collision:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) V^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R}
$$

But we can also compute this as:

$$
E = \frac{L^2}{2 (m_1 + m_2) R^2} + \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) V_r^2 - \frac{G M (m_1 + m_2)}{R}
$$

Where $ V_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $ is radial component.

But maybe better: use **specific** (per unit mass) angular momentum and energy:

- Specific angular momentum: $ h = \frac{L}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} $
- Specific energy: $ \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{G M}{R} $

Now, for any Keplerian orbit:

- Perigee: $ r_p = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e} $
- Also, $ \epsilon = - \frac{G M}{2 a} $, and $ r_p = a (1 - e) $

From these, we can find $ r_a = a (1 + e) = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 - e} $

But we know $ r_p = R/2 $, and we know $ h $, so:

$$
\frac{h^2}{G M} = r_p (1 + e) = \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
$$

But also:

$$
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 G M R \Rightarrow \frac{h^2}{G M} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 R
$$

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 R = \frac{R}{2} (1 + e) \Rightarrow 1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2
\Rightarrow e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 - 1
$$

Same as before. Good.

Now, for orbit to be **elliptical**, need $ 0 \le e < 1 $, so:

$$
0 \le 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 - 1 < 1
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \le \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 < 1
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow m_2 \ge \frac{m_1 + m_2}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow m_2 (1 - 1/\sqrt{2}) \ge m_1 / \sqrt{2}
\Rightarrow m_1 \le m_2 (\sqrt{2} - 1)
$$

So condition: $ m_1 \le (\sqrt{2} - 1) m_2 \approx 0.414 m_2 $

This is more reasonable than previous result. So likely earlier algebra had error in energy expression.

Let’s now find $ v_1 $ using **radial velocity after collision**.

We know that in the post-collision orbit, at position $ r = R $, the radial velocity is $ V_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} $

But for a Keplerian orbit, the radial velocity at distance r is given by:

$$
v_r = \frac{G M}{h} e \sin \theta
$$

And radial distance:

$$
r = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

At collision, $ r = R $, so:

$$
R = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta} = \frac{ (m_2^2 / m^2) R }{1 + e \cos \theta}
\Rightarrow 1 = \frac{ m_2^2 / m^2 }{1 + e \cos \theta}
\Rightarrow 1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{m_2^2}{m^2}
$$

But recall from earlier: $ 1 + e = 2 m_2^2 / m^2 \Rightarrow m_2^2 / m^2 = (1 + e)/2 $

So:

$$
1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{1 + e}{2} \Rightarrow e \cos \theta = \frac{1 + e}{2} - 1 = \frac{e - 1}{2}
\Rightarrow \cos \theta = \frac{e - 1}{2 e}
$$

Now, radial velocity:

$$
v_r = \frac{G M}{h} e \sin \theta
$$

We know $ v_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{m} $ (negative because inward)

Compute $ \frac{G M}{h} = \frac{G M}{ (m_2/m) \sqrt{G M R} } = \frac{m}{m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

So:

$$
|v_r| = \frac{m}{m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } e |\sin \theta|
$$

Now, $ \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \left( \frac{e - 1}{2 e} \right)^2 = \frac{4 e^2 - (e - 1)^2}{4 e^2} = \frac{4 e^2 - (e^2 - 2 e + 1)}{4 e^2} = \frac{3 e^2 + 2 e - 1}{4 e^2} $

This is messy.

Alternative: use **energy conservation** between collision point and perigee.

At perigee (r = R/2), speed = $ v_p $, radial velocity = 0.

So specific energy:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{2 G M}{R}
$$

At collision point (r = R):

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{G M}{R} = \frac{1}{2} (V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{G M}{R}
$$

But $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m} v_0 = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M / R} $

So:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{m^2} + \frac{m_2^2 G M}{m^2 R} \right) - \frac{G M}{R}
$$

Also, angular momentum conservation gives:

$$
h = R V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} = (R/2) v_p \Rightarrow v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Now plug into energy at perigee:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4 m_2^2}{m^2} \frac{G M}{R} \right) - \frac{2 G M}{R} = \frac{2 m_2^2 G M}{m^2 R} - \frac{2 G M}{R} = \frac{2 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right)
$$

Set equal to energy at collision:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{m^2} + \frac{m_2^2 G M}{m^2 R} \right) - \frac{G M}{R} = \frac{2 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right)
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{m^2} + \frac{m_2^2 G M}{m^2 R} - \frac{2 G M}{R} = \frac{4 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right)
$$

Bring terms together:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{m^2} = \frac{4 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right) - \frac{m_2^2 G M}{m^2 R} + \frac{2 G M}{R}
$$

Simplify RHS:

= $ \frac{G M}{R} \left[ 4 \left( \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 1 \right) - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 2 \right] = \frac{G M}{R} \left[ 4 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 4 - \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} + 2 \right] = \frac{G M}{R} \left[ 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right] $

Thus:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{m^2} = \frac{G M}{R} \left( 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right)
\Rightarrow v_1^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{ m^2 }{ m_1^2 } \left( 3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{ 3 m_2^2 - 2 m^2 }{ m_1^2 }
$$

Now substitute $ m = m_1 + m_2 $:

$$
v_1^2 = \frac{G M}{R m_1^2} \left( 3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2 \right) = \frac{G M}{R m_1^2} \left( 3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2 \right) = \frac{G M}{R m_1^2} \left( m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 \right)
$$

Same as before! So algebra was correct.

But then for $ v_1^2 > 0 $, need:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 > 0
\Rightarrow m_2 > m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6}) \approx 4.45 m_1
\Rightarrow m_1 < \frac{m_2}{2 + \sqrt{6}} \approx 0.225 m_2
$$

But earlier from eccentricity condition, we had $ m_1 < (\sqrt{2} - 1) m_2 \approx 0.414 m_2 $

So the stricter condition is from $ v_1^2 > 0 $, i.e., $ m_1 < m_2 / (2 + \sqrt{6}) $

But wait—is it possible that the conglomerate orbit has **perigee = R/2**, but the collision occurs **after perigee**, i.e., the object is moving outward? In that case, radial velocity would be positive, but meteorite is falling in, so radial velocity after collision is inward (negative), so the object is moving **toward perigee**, so perigee is **ahead**, so r = R > r_p, which is fine.

But the issue is: can the perigee be R/2 if the angular momentum is small?

Note: minimum possible perigee for given angular momentum occurs for radial orbit (h=0) → r_p = 0. But here h is fixed by m2.

The perigee is given by:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e} \ge \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{2} \quad \text{(since } e < 1 \text{)}
$$

But also, for a given energy, there is a minimum perigee.

But perhaps the resolution is: **the derived condition is correct**, and the earlier eccentricity condition is necessary but not sufficient; the positivity of v1^2 gives the actual physical condition.

Let’s accept that.

So answer to (i):

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R m_1^2} \left( m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 \right) }
$$

But wait—this is only valid if the expression inside sqrt is positive.

However, let's double-check with a limiting case.

Suppose $ m_1 \to 0 $ (tiny meteorite). Then the space station barely changes velocity. Its orbit remains nearly circular at R, so perigee should be ~R, not R/2. To make perigee R/2, the meteorite must significantly reduce the angular momentum or add radial velocity.

But if m1 is very small, it cannot change the orbit much, so indeed, to get perigee R/2, m1 cannot be too small? No, wait—if m1 is very small but very fast radially, it can add radial velocity without changing angular momentum much, making the orbit elliptical with same angular momentum but lower energy → more eccentric.

Ah! So even small m1 can cause large radial velocity if v1 is large.

In our expression, as $ m_1 \to 0 $, to keep v1 finite, the term in parentheses must scale as m1^2, but it doesn't—it goes to m2^2, so v1 ~ 1/m1 → infinity. So yes, a very small meteorite must be extremely fast to cause such a change.

So the expression makes sense.

Thus, (i) answer:

**(i)** The speed of the meteorite just before collision is:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 }{ m_1^2 } }
$$

provided the numerator is positive.

---

## (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate

In an elliptical orbit, speed is **maximum at perigee**, **minimum at apogee**.

We already have perigee speed:

From angular momentum conservation:

$$
v_p = \frac{h}{r_p} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{G M R} }{ R/2 } = \frac{2 m_2}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Apogee distance $ r_a $: use $ r_p r_a = \frac{h^2}{G M} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} $? No.

Better: for ellipse, $ r_p + r_a = 2a $, and $ r_p r_a = \frac{h^2}{G M} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e^2} \cdot (1 - e^2) = \frac{h^2}{G M} \cdot \frac{1}{?} $

Actually, use:

$$
r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e) \Rightarrow r_p r_a = a^2 (1 - e^2)
$$

And $ h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2) \Rightarrow a (1 - e^2) = \frac{h^2}{G M} \Rightarrow r_p r_a = a \cdot \frac{h^2}{G M} $

But easier: use angular momentum at apogee:

$$
v_a = \frac{h}{r_a}, \quad \text{and} \quad r_a = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 - e}
$$

We have $ h^2 / (G M) = (m_2^2 / m^2) R $, and $ e = 2 (m_2^2 / m^2) - 1 $

So:

$$
1 - e = 1 - [2 (m_2^2 / m^2) - 1] = 2 (1 - m_2^2 / m^2) = 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) / m^2 ? Wait:

$ 1 - m_2^2/m^2 = (m^2 - m_2^2)/m^2 = (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)/m^2 = m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)/m^2 $

So:

$$
r_a = \frac{ (m_2^2 / m^2) R }{ 2 (1 - m_2^2 / m^2) } = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 (m^2 - m_2^2) } = \frac{ m_2^2 R }{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }
$$

Then:

$$
v_a = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{ (m_2 / m) \sqrt{G M R} }{ r_a } = \frac{ m_2 \sqrt{G M R} }{ m } \cdot \frac{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }{ m_2^2 R } = \frac{ 2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2) }{ m m_2 } \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

But maybe simpler to use energy:

At apogee:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} v_a^",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that **surface brightness (or surface magnitude)** is **independent of distance** in a **non-expanding universe**, we need to understand how flux, solid angle, and magnitude behave with distance.

---

### Step 1: Definitions

- **Apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to its observed flux $ F $ by:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
  $$
  where $ F_0 $ is a reference flux.

- **Surface brightness** (or **surface magnitude**) is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle. It is often expressed in magnitudes per square arcminute ($ \mathrm{mag/arcmin^2} $).

- The **solid angle** $ \Omega $ subtended by an object at distance $ D $ is:
  $$
  \Omega \propto \frac{A}{D^2}
  $$
  where $ A $ is the physical area of the object (assumed constant for a given galaxy).

- In a **non-expanding universe**, light follows the inverse-square law: the total flux $ F_{\text{total}} $ received from a galaxy scales as:
  $$
  F_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{L}{D^2}
  $$
  where $ L $ is the galaxy's luminosity.

---

### Step 2: Surface Brightness in Terms of Flux per Solid Angle

Let’s define **flux per unit solid angle** as:
$$
\Sigma = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{\Omega}
$$

Substitute the scalings:
- $ F_{\text{total}} \propto D^{-2} $
- $ \Omega \propto D^{-2} $

Therefore:
$$
\Sigma \propto \frac{D^{-2}}{D^{-2}} = \text{constant}
$$

So **flux per unit solid angle is independent of distance**.

---

### Step 3: Relate to Surface Magnitude

Surface magnitude $ \mu $ is defined analogously to apparent magnitude, but using flux per unit solid angle:

$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\Sigma}{\Sigma_0} \right)
$$

Since $ \Sigma $ is **independent of distance**, so is $ \mu $. That is:

> **In a non-expanding universe, surface brightness (or surface magnitude) does not depend on the distance to the galaxy.**

---

### Step 4: Intuitive Explanation

Even though a galaxy gets fainter (lower total flux) as it moves farther away, it also appears smaller (smaller solid angle), and these two effects **exactly cancel** when considering **flux per unit solid angle**. Hence, its ""brightness per unit area on the sky"" remains constant.

This is why nearby galaxies like Andromeda can have a modest total apparent magnitude (e.g., 3.44), but appear dim to the eye — their light is spread over a large area, and the surface brightness is low. But if you moved Andromeda farther away, it would look smaller **and** fainter, but just as ""bright per unit area"".

---

### Final Answer

In a non-expanding universe, surface magnitude is independent of distance because both the observed flux and the solid angle scale as $ 1/D^2 $, so their ratio (flux per solid angle) — which determines surface brightness — remains constant with distance. Since magnitude is a logarithmic measure of this ratio, surface magnitude is also constant with distance.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude: 

so $\varepsilon < 1.$

According to: 

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

$\frac{1}{2}hT = \pi ab,\; p = \frac{h^{2}}{k} = \frac{b^{2}}{a},$

Conclude: 

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}/k}
= \frac{\frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}/a}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{k} a^{3},$

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"To derive **Kepler’s laws** from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, we begin by recalling both sets of principles:

---

### **Kepler’s Three Laws (Empirical, 1609–1619):**
1. **Law of Ellipses**: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
2. **Law of Equal Areas**: A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3. **Harmonic Law**: The square of the orbital period \( T \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( a \):  
   \[
   T^2 \propto a^3
   \]

---

### **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation (1687):**
\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
where:
- \( M \): mass of the Sun (assumed stationary),
- \( m \): mass of the planet,
- \( r \): distance between them,
- \( \hat{r} \): unit vector from Sun to planet,
- \( G \): gravitational constant.

We now **derive each of Kepler’s laws** from Newtonian mechanics and gravitation.

---

## **Step 1: Derive Kepler’s Second Law (Equal Areas in Equal Times)**

This law is a consequence of **conservation of angular momentum**, which arises from the **central nature** of the gravitational force.

- The gravitational force is **central**: it acts along the line joining the two bodies → torque \( \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0 \).
- Therefore, **angular momentum \( \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m\vec{v} \)** is conserved.

The magnitude of angular momentum:
\[
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta}
\]
(in polar coordinates in the orbital plane).

Now, consider the **area swept out** by the radius vector in time \( dt \):
\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\]
So the **areal velocity** is:
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{2m}
\]

Since \( L \) is constant (conserved), \( \frac{dA}{dt} = \text{constant} \).

✅ **Thus, Kepler’s second law is derived directly from conservation of angular momentum due to the central gravitational force.**

---

## **Step 2: Derive Kepler’s First Law (Elliptical Orbits)**

We now solve the **equation of motion** under an inverse-square central force.

Start with Newton’s second law for the planet (mass \( m \)) under Sun’s gravity:
\[
m \ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

Because the motion is planar (due to angular momentum conservation), use **plane polar coordinates** \( (r, \theta) \).

The radial equation of motion is:
\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

Use conservation of angular momentum: \( L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} \Rightarrow \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2} \)

Substitute into radial equation:
\[
\ddot{r} - r \left( \frac{L}{m r^2} \right)^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\ddot{r} - \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^3} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

This is hard to solve in \( r(t) \). Instead, change variable to \( u = 1/r \), and use \( \theta \) as independent variable.

Using the standard trick (from classical mechanics):
\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2}
\]

This is a **linear second-order ODE**. Its general solution is:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Choose \( \theta_0 = 0 \) (rotate coordinate system), so:
\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\]
where \( e = \frac{A L^2}{G M m^2} \) is the **eccentricity**.

Rewriting:
\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2}
\]

This is the **polar equation of a conic section** with one focus at the origin.

- For bound orbits (\( E < 0 \)), \( 0 \leq e < 1 \) → **ellipse**.
- The Sun is at one focus (origin).

✅ **Thus, Kepler’s first law is derived: planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.**

---

## **Step 3: Derive Kepler’s Third Law (Harmonic Law)**

We now relate the **orbital period \( T \)** to the **semi-major axis \( a \)**.

From Kepler’s second law:
\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\text{Total area } A = \pi a b = \frac{L}{2m} T
\]
where \( b \) is the semi-minor axis.

So:
\[
T = \frac{2m \pi a b}{L}
\]

We also know from the orbit equation that:
\[
p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} = a(1 - e^2)
\]
and since \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \), then:
\[
b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad b^2 = a^2 (1 - e^2) = a p
\]

Now compute \( T^2 \):

Start from:
\[
T = \frac{2m \pi a b}{L} \Rightarrow T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 m^2 a^2 b^2}{L^2}
\]

Substitute \( b^2 = a p = a \cdot \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} \):

\[
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 m^2 a^2}{L^2} \cdot \left( a \cdot \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} \right)
= \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M}
\]

Thus:
\[
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

✅ **This is Kepler’s third law**, now with the proportionality constant explicitly given by Newtonian gravity.

- It shows \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), as observed.
- The constant depends only on the central mass \( M \) (Sun), not on the planet’s mass \( m \) (assuming \( m \ll M \)).

> **Note**: If both masses are comparable, replace \( M \) with \( M + m \), but for planets around the Sun, \( m \ll M \), so \( M + m \approx M \).

18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

(II) If the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at the centre, then we consider Keplerian motion. $V=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\to\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}.$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"We are asked to **derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location**, i.e., $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$, in two different galactic mass models:

- **Case I**: The actual observed rotation curve (which is approximately flat).
- **Case II**: A hypothetical Galaxy with all mass concentrated at the center (i.e., Keplerian rotation).

To do this, we will use the definitions and approximations provided in the problem, especially the relation between the **Oort constants** $A$ and $B$, and the derivative of the rotation curve.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Oort constants

From Galactic dynamics, the **Oort constants** $A$ and $B$ are defined in terms of the circular velocity $V(R)$ and its derivative at the solar radius $R_0$:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

These come from expanding the relative motion of nearby stars/clouds in the solar neighborhood under the assumption of axisymmetric rotation.

Alternatively, one can derive these from the given approximate forms:

- $V_r = A D \sin 2l$
- $V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D$

and compare with the exact expressions expanded to first order in $D/R_0$.

But since the standard definitions are well-known and consistent with the problem’s description (Jan Oort’s linear approximation), we’ll use them.

Our goal is to **solve for $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$** in each case. So rearrange the above:

Add and subtract the equations:

From the definitions:
$$
A - B = \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
$$
Wait — let's check:

Compute $A - B$:

$$
A - B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' \right) - \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + V' \right) \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' + \frac{V_0}{R_0} + V' \right) = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So that’s not it.

Now compute $-(A + B)$:

$$
A + B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + V' \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' - \frac{V_0}{R_0} - V' \right) = -V'
$$

So:
$$
A + B = - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = - (A + B)
$$

✅ This is the key relation we will use.

So if we can find $A + B$ in each case, or directly compute $\frac{dV}{dR}$ from the assumed form of $V(R)$, we can answer the question.

---

### Step 2: Case II – All mass at center (Keplerian rotation)

In this case, the Galaxy's mass is treated as a point mass $M$ at the center. Then, the circular velocity at radius $R$ is:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

So compute the derivative:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, this gives:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

✅ **Answer for Case II**:  
$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} }
$$

---

### Step 3: Case I – Actual observed rotation curve

Observations show that **the rotation curve of the Milky Way is nearly flat** in the solar neighborhood, i.e., $V(R) \approx \text{constant} = V_0$ over a range including $R_0$.

Therefore:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \approx 0 \quad \text{at } R = R_0
$$

More precisely, measurements suggest a **very small** gradient, but for the purpose of this problem (and standard textbook treatment), we take the flat rotation curve to mean:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = 0
$$

✅ **Answer for Case I**:  
$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = 0 }
$$

---

### Optional: Cross-check via Oort constants

For completeness:

- In **Case I (flat rotation curve)**: $V = V_0 = \text{const} \Rightarrow dV/dR = 0$

Then from definitions:
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 0 \right) = \frac{V_0}{2R_0}, \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + 0 \right) = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}
$$
So $A + B = 0 \Rightarrow dV/dR = 0$, consistent.

- In **Case II (Keplerian)**: $V = \sqrt{GM/R} \Rightarrow V_0 = \sqrt{GM/R_0}$

Then:
$$
\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$
So:
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - (-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0}) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{3V_0}{2R_0} \right) = \frac{3V_0}{4R_0}
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + (-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0}) \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{2R_0} \right) = -\frac{V_0}{4R_0}
$$
Then $A + B = \frac{3V_0}{4R_0} - \frac{V_0}{4R_0} = \frac{V_0}{2R_0}$, so $-(A + B) = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}$, which matches $dV/dR$. ✅

### Final Answers:

- **Case I (Actual Galaxy, flat rotation curve):**
  $$
  \boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = 0 }
  $$

- **Case II (Keplerian, mass at center):**
  $$
  \boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R = R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} }

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

- $ V_0 $: the circular rotational velocity of the Sun around the Galactic Center,
- $ R_0 $: the distance from the Sun to the Galactic Center,
- $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $: the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's position.

We are told that Oort considered the **local neighborhood**, i.e., distances $ D \ll R_0 $, and expanded the exact expressions for line-of-sight and transverse velocities to first order in $ D $. The resulting approximations are:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Our goal is to **relate $ A $ and $ B $** to $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ dV/dR|_{R_0} $.

---

### Step 1: Recall the exact expressions for $ V_r $ and $ V_t $

From the problem statement:

- $ V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l $
- $ V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D $

Where:
- $ \Omega = V(R)/R $ is the angular velocity of the HI cloud at Galactocentric radius $ R $,
- $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $ is the angular velocity of the Sun.

We also have the geometric relation (from the law of cosines or basic trigonometry in the Galactic plane):

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

But since we are considering **local clouds**, $ D \ll R_0 $, so we can expand $ R $ as:

$$
R \approx R_0 - D \cos l + \mathcal{O}(D^2/R_0)
$$

This will help us expand $ \Omega = V(R)/R $ about $ R = R_0 $.

---

### Step 2: Expand $ \Omega - \Omega_0 $ to first order in $ D $

Let’s write a Taylor expansion of $ \Omega(R) = V(R)/R $ about $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
$$

Using $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $, we get:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} (-D \cos l) = - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Now plug this into the expression for $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx - R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l
$$

Recall the identity: $ \sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l $, so:

$$
V_r = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

But Oort’s formula says:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

Therefore, comparing both expressions:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Express $ d\Omega/dR $ in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ dV/dR $

We know:

$$
\Omega = \frac{V(R)}{R} \Rightarrow \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

Evaluated at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Plug into equation (1):

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right ) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right )
$$

So,

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right )}
\tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 4: Derive expression for $ B $

Now consider the transverse velocity:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

Again, use the expansion:

- $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos l $
- $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $ (since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can approximate $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $ in the second term to first order)

So:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Now recall Oort’s expression:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Use identity: $ \cos 2l = 2 \cos^2 l - 1 \Rightarrow \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $

Then:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Group terms:

$$
V_t = \left[ -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right] D \cos 2l + \left[ -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 \right] D
$$

Compare with Oort’s form:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

So we identify:

- $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} $ (consistent with earlier),
- $ B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left. \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 $

Now substitute the expression for $ d\Omega/dR $ again:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right ) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right ) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Simplify:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

The key assumptions are:

- The disc is **geometrically thin** and **stationary**.
- The gas follows **Keplerian circular orbits**.
- Viscous processes allow the gas to **slowly spiral inward**, converting mechanical energy into heat (radiated away).
- We ignore self-gravity of the disc.
- $ R_{\min} \ll R_{\text{max}} $, and we're evaluating the energy released down to some $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, so we can approximate the total energy released as the difference in specific mechanical energy between $ R_{\text{max}} $ and $ r $.

---

### Step 1: Mechanical Energy in a Keplerian Orbit

For a test mass in a **circular Keplerian orbit** around a central mass $ M $, the **specific mechanical energy** (i.e., energy per unit mass) is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \text{kinetic energy per unit mass} + \text{gravitational potential energy per unit mass}
$$

We know:

- Gravitational potential energy per unit mass:  
  $$
  U(r) = -\frac{GM}{r}
  $$

- For a circular orbit, centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:
  $$
  \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
  $$

- So kinetic energy per unit mass is:
  $$
  K(r) = \frac{1}{2} v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r}
  $$

Thus, total specific mechanical energy is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = K(r) + U(r) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

This is a standard result: **the specific orbital energy of a circular Keplerian orbit is $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $**.

---

### Step 2: Energy Released During Inward Migration

As the gas element moves **quasi-statically** from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $, its mechanical energy decreases (becomes more negative). The **energy released** (i.e., the amount of mechanical energy converted to heat/radiation) is the **loss** in mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r)
$$

Because energy is **released**, we take the initial energy minus the final energy (since final energy is more negative):

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2 R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2 r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

Now, we are told that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, which implies $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{1}{r} $. Therefore, we can **neglect** the $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} $ term in comparison to $ \frac{1}{r} $.

So, to a very good approximation:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

- $ s $ is the initial proper distance at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant (assumed constant in the Steady-State model),
- $ c $ is the speed of light,
- A laser is sent from Earth at $ t = 0 $ toward a mirror placed initially at distance $ D $. So we identify $ s = D $,

- We are to find an expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $,
- We may use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, which suggests that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, i.e., the expansion over the round-trip time is small.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In an expanding universe, light does **not** simply travel a fixed distance $ D $, reflect, and come back in time $ 2D/c $. Because while the light is traveling, the mirror is receding due to expansion. So the outbound trip takes longer than $ D/c $, and the return trip also takes additional time because during the return, the Earth (or the origin point) is also moving away from the returning light — but actually, in this problem, it says the **mirror maintains its spatial orientation in the same plane** via gyroscopes, but **the separation increases only due to expansion**, so both Earth and mirror are **comoving** with the Hubble flow.

However, note: the problem says the mirror is ""fully reflecting"", ""placed at distance D"", and that the **separation increases only due to expansion**, following $ S(t) = s e^{H_0 t} $. So both endpoints are comoving; there's no peculiar motion.

But here's a key point: In general relativity, in an expanding universe, light propagation must be treated carefully using conformal time or integrating along null geodesics. However, the problem gives us a specific law for how the proper distance between two comoving points evolves: $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $. This is characteristic of a **de Sitter universe** (exponential expansion) with constant Hubble parameter — which is consistent with the Steady-State model (which requires continuous creation of matter to maintain constant density in an exponentially expanding universe).

So we accept that the proper distance between Earth and mirror at time $ t $ is $ D e^{H_0 t} $.

Now, we send a light signal at $ t = 0 $ from Earth toward the mirror. It reaches the mirror at some time $ t = t_1 $, then returns and is detected at $ t = T $.

We need to compute $ T $ as a function of $ D, H_0, c $, then invert to get $ H_0(D, c, T) $.

---

### Step 2: Light propagation in an exponentially expanding universe

In a flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) universe with scale factor $ a(t) $, the proper distance is $ S(t) = a(t) \chi $, where $ \chi $ is the comoving coordinate separation.

Given $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, we can identify:
- $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $ (choosing normalization so that $ a(0) = 1 $),
- Then the comoving distance to the mirror is $ \chi = D $, since $ S(0) = a(0)\chi = \chi = D $.

For light, the null geodesic satisfies:
$$
c dt = a(t) d\chi \quad \Rightarrow \quad d\chi = \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = c e^{-H_0 t} dt
$$

So, for the **outgoing** light ray from Earth ($ \chi = 0 $) to mirror ($ \chi = D $), we integrate:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Compute the integral:

$$
c \int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t} dt = c \left[ \frac{1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}}{H_0} \right] = D
$$

So:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D \quad \text{(1)}
$$

Similarly, for the **return** trip: light leaves mirror at $ t = t_1 $, arrives at Earth at $ t = T $. Since light moves toward decreasing $ \chi $, but the integral of $ |d\chi| $ is still the same:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Because the comoving distance is still $ D $, and light must traverse the same comoving distance back.

So:

$$
c \int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-H_0 t} dt = c \left[ \frac{e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}}{H_0} \right] = D \quad \text{(2)}
$$

Now add equations (1) and (2):

Left-hand sides: total comoving distance traversed is $ D + D = 2D $

Right-hand side:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) + \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}) = \frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T})
$$

So:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D \quad \text{(3)}
$$

This is a key equation relating $ T $, $ D $, $ H_0 $, and $ c $.

Now solve for $ H_0 $.

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ H_0 $

From equation (3):

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

This is a transcendental equation. But the problem says we may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $. Since $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, then $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \dots $. To first order:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T
$$

Then:

$$
1 - (1 - H_0 T) = H_0 T \approx \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Cancel $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Wait — that’s just the static result! That can’t give us $ H_0 $. So we need to go to **next order** in the expansion to capture the effect of expansion on the round-trip time.

Indeed, if we only keep first-order terms, the correction vanishes. So we must expand to **second order**.

Let’s do that.

Use:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

Then:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

Plug into equation (3):

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (again assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
\frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = T - \frac{2D}{c}
$$

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right ) = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait — in a non-expanding universe, $ T_0 = 2D/c $. So define $ \Delta T = T - T_0 = T - 2D/c $. Then:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2 \Delta T}{T^2}
$$

But perhaps better to express directly:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{2D}{c T} \right )
$$

However, note that $ \frac{2D}{c T} \approx 1 $, since $ T \approx 2D/c $. So the term in parentheses is small, as expected.

But maybe we can write a cleaner expression.

Recall that without expansion, $ T_0 = 2D/c $. With expansion, $ T = T_0 + \delta T $, where $ \delta T > 0 $. Then to first order in $ H_0 $, we can approximate $ T \approx T_0 $ in the denominator.

From earlier:

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = \frac{2D}{c} = T_0
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{2(T - T_0)}{T^2}
$$

But if we approximate $ T \approx T_0 $ in the denominator (since the difference is small), then:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2(T - T_0)}{T_0^2} = \frac{2(T - 2D/c)}{(2D/c)^2} = \frac{2(T - 2D/c) c^2}{4 D^2} = \frac{(T - 2D/c) c^2}{2 D^2}
$$

But the problem asks for an expression **in terms of $ D, c, T $** — so we shouldn't introduce $ T_0 $. So go back to:

From equation (3):

$$
\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

We want to solve for $ H_0 $. But unless we use approximation, we can't invert exactly.

Given that the problem allows $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, but as we saw, that leads to triviality unless we go to second order. However, maybe there's another approach.

### Alternative Approach: Consider instantaneous proper distance during light travel

But the problem might be expecting a **simpler Newtonian-like treatment**, interpreting the law $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ as the proper distance at time $ t $, and assuming that light moves at speed $ c $ relative to local space, so the rate of change of the distance between light pulse and mirror is affected by recession velocity.

Let’s try a heuristic derivation.

#### Outbound journey:

At time $ t $, mirror is at distance $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $. The light is moving outward at speed $ c $, but the mirror is receding at speed $ v = dS/dt = H_0 D e^{H_0 t} = H_0 S(t) $.

But in special relativity + expansion heuristic, the closing speed between light and mirror is $ c - v(t) $, but this is not strictly correct in GR, but maybe acceptable in this problem's context.

However, this approach is flawed because light always moves at $ c $ locally, but the global distance change isn't simply $ c - v $.

Given that the problem provides the exact relation $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and asks to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ if necessary, perhaps they expect us to consider that during the light’s travel time, the distance increases slightly, and compute the extra path length.

Let’s denote:

- Light leaves at $ t = 0 $, mirror at $ D $.
- Suppose light reaches mirror at time $ t_1 $. During this time, the mirror has moved to $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $.
- But the light has traveled a distance $ c t_1 $. However, in expanding space, the total distance the light covers is **not** simply $ c t_1 $, because space stretches while it travels.

But again, the rigorous way is the FLRW null geodesic we did earlier, leading to equation (3):

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

Now, **solve this exactly for $ H_0 $**:

Multiply both sides by $ H_0 / c $:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

This cannot be solved algebraically for $ H_0 $ using elementary functions. But the problem says “you may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $”, implying that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, so we should expand to **first order in $ H_0 $**.

But as noted, to first order:

$ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T $, so LHS ≈ $ H_0 T $, RHS = $ 2 D H_0 / c $, cancel $ H_0 $, get $ T = 2D/c $, which gives no info about $ H_0 $.

So to determine $ H_0 $, we **must** measure the **deviation** from $ T = 2D/c $. Therefore, the expression for $ H_0 $ will involve $ T - 2D/c $.

Thus, we need to expand to **second order** in $ H_0 T $, even though the problem only mentions first-order approximation. But maybe they implicitly allow that.

So proceed with expansion up to $ (H_0 T)^2 $:

As before:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

So:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Divide by $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = \frac{2D}{c}
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
$$

This is a valid approximate expression for $ H_0 $ to first order in the small quantity $ (T - 2D/c) $.

We can also write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But perhaps the cleanest form is:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}
$$

This expresses $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D, c, T $, as required.

We can check dimensions:
- $ T $: time,
- $ D/c $: time,
- So numerator: time,
- Denominator: time²,
- So overall: 1/time → correct for Hubble constant.

Also, if $ T = 2D/c $, then $ H_0 = 0 $, as expected (no expansion).

If $ T > 2D/c $, then $ H_0 > 0 $, which makes sense: expansion increases light travel time.

Thus, this is physically reasonable.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$. Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.","According to: 

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"We are asked to find the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ of a binary neutron star system consisting of two identical masses $ M $, orbiting each other in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ (around their center of mass). The problem tells us:

- The system can be treated as Newtonian circular orbits that slowly shrink due to energy loss via gravitational waves.
- The luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ depends only on:
  - A dimensionless constant: $ \frac{2}{5} $
  - Gravitational constant $ G $
  - Speed of light $ c $
  - Mass $ M $
  - Orbital radius $ R $
- Additionally, **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power** in the final expression.

Our goal is to **use dimensional analysis**, along with the given information, to construct the correct formula for $ L_{\text{GW}} $, and then insert the given numerical prefactor $ \frac{2}{5} $.

### Step 1: Understand what luminosity means dimensionally

Luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ is power, i.e., energy per unit time. So its dimensions are:

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{M L^2}{T^3}
$$

In terms of fundamental dimensions (mass $ M $, length $ L $, time $ T $):

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = M L^2 T^{-3}
$$

---

### Step 2: List dimensions of constants

- $ G $: Newton’s gravitational constant  
  From Newton’s law: $ F = G \frac{M^2}{R^2} \Rightarrow [G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} $

- $ c $: speed of light  
  $[c] = L T^{-1}$

- $ M $: mass → $[M] = M$

- $ R $: length → $[R] = L$

---

### Step 3: Assume general form

We are told that the expression involves a single term made from $ G $, $ c $, $ M $, and $ R $, multiplied by the dimensionless constant $ \frac{2}{5} $. Also, **the powers of $ c $ and $ R $ are equal**.

So assume:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^d \cdot R^e
$$

with the condition:  
$$
b = e \quad \text{(since $ c $ and $ R $ have same exponent)}
$$

Now do dimensional analysis.

Compute dimensions of RHS:

- $ [G^a] = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a = M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a} $
- $ [c^b] = (L T^{-1})^b = L^b T^{-b} $
- $ [M^d] = M^d $
- $ [R^e] = L^e $

Total dimensions:

$$
M^{-a + d} \cdot L^{3a + b + e} \cdot T^{-2a - b}
$$

Set equal to dimensions of luminosity: $ M^1 L^2 T^{-3} $

So equate exponents:

1. Mass:            $ -a + d = 1 $ → (1)
2. Length:          $ 3a + b + e = 2 $ → (2)
3. Time:           $ -2a - b = -3 $ → (3)
4. Given condition:    $ b = e $ → (4)

Now solve this system.

From (4): $ e = b $. Plug into (2):

→ $ 3a + b + b = 2 \Rightarrow 3a + 2b = 2 $ → (2')

From (3): $ -2a - b = -3 \Rightarrow 2a + b = 3 $ → (3')

Now solve (2') and (3'):

From (3'): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Plug into (2'):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
(-a) + 6 = 2 \\
-a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Then $ b = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 $

So $ b = -5 $, and since $ e = b $, $ e = -5 $

Now from (1): $ -a + d = 1 \Rightarrow -4 + d = 1 \Rightarrow d = 5 $

So we have:

- $ a = 4 $
- $ b = -5 $
- $ d = 5 $
- $ e = -5 $

Thus,

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^4 \cdot c^{-5} \cdot M^5 \cdot R^{-5}
$$

Or more neatly:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But wait! This seems off compared to the known quadrupole formula result.

Let’s double-check because **the standard result for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary** is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5} \quad \text{(for two equal masses $ M $)}
$$

Wait — actually, let's recall carefully.

The standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a binary with masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $, separated by orbital separation $ a $ (note: this is the **separation between the two bodies**, not the orbital radius around the center of mass), is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

For equal masses $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, total mass $ 2M $, so:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 (2M)}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

But note: in this standard formula, **$ a $ is the separation between the two stars**, not the orbital radius around the center of mass.

In our problem, it says: “two identical neutron stars of mass $ M $ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass.”

So for two equal masses, each orbits the center of mass at distance $ R $, so the **separation between them is**:

$$
a = 2R
$$

Therefore, if we plug $ a = 2R $ into the standard formula:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{64}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Aha! That matches exactly the result we got from dimensional analysis!

So everything is consistent.

> Therefore, the correct expression is:
>
> $$
> L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
> $$

Also, note that indeed **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**: both to the power $ -5 $, satisfying the condition in the problem.

This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"We are given a binary system of two identical neutron stars, each of mass $ M $, orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ about their center of mass. The system loses energy due to gravitational wave (GW) emission at a rate:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Our goal is to find an expression for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, the rate at which the orbital separation (more precisely, the orbital radius of each star around the center of mass) shrinks due to this energy loss.

### Step 1: Understand the total mechanical energy of the system

In a Newtonian circular binary system, the total mechanical energy $ E $ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For two masses $ M $ and $ M $, separated by a distance $ a = 2R $ (since each orbits at radius $ R $ from the center of mass), the standard result for total energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a} = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

> **Explanation**: In a binary system with reduced mass $ \mu = \frac{M_1 M_2}{M_1 + M_2} $, the total energy is $ E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a} $, where $ a $ is the separation between the two bodies. Here, $ M_1 = M_2 = M $, so $ a = 2R $, and $ E = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R} $.

So,

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate energy loss to change in radius

The power radiated in gravitational waves, $ L_{\text{GW}} $, equals the negative rate of change of the system's total mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using the chain rule:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

Set this equal to $ -L_{\text{GW}} $:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $

Multiply both sides by $ \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
$$

Simplify:

- $ G^4 / G = G^3 $
- $ M^5 / M^2 = M^3 $
- $ R^2 / R^5 = 1 / R^3 $
- Constants: $ 2 \cdot 4 = 8 $

So:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3} }
$$

This negative sign indicates that the orbital radius decreases over time due to gravitational wave emission, as expected.",0.49
