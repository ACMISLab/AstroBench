Denote the masses of the Sun and the planet by $M$ and $m$. Based on the given information, derive the differential equations for the two-body problem.","According to: 

The Sun is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the planet

Likewise, the planet is subject to the gravitational force exerted by the Sun

$F_{P} = k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{2}} \frac{-r}{|r|} = -k^{2} \frac{Mm}{r^{3}} r$

From Newton’s second law: both the Sun and the planet accelerate under the action of force

2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.",No,"# Derivation of the Virial Theorem from Newton's Second Law

## Step 1: Start with Newton's Second Law

For a particle of mass $m$ with position vector $\mathbf{r}$ and net force $\mathbf{F}$:

$$\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}$$

## Step 2: Form the Virial (Inner Product)

Take the inner product of both sides with the position vector $\mathbf{r}$:

$$\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}$$

## Step 3: Sum Over All Particles

For a system of many particles, sum over all $N$ particles:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2}$$

## Step 4: Manipulate the Right Side Using Chain Rule

Let me rewrite the right side. Note that:

$$\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}\right) - \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}$$

This comes from the product rule for differentiation.

## Step 5: Recognize the Velocity Terms

Since $\frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{v}_i$ (velocity):

$$\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\right) - v_i^2$$

## Step 6: Define Kinetic Energy Moment

Let $I = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i$ (the ""moment of kinetic energy""), then:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} - 2K$$

where $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2}m_i v_i^2$ is the total kinetic energy.

## Step 7: Separate Internal and External Forces

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i^{\text{int}} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i^{\text{ext}}$$

For an isolated system (or one in equilibrium), the external force term vanishes or is negligible.

## Step 8: The Virial Theorem (General Form)

$$\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i^{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} - 2K}$$

## Step 9: Time-Averaged or Equilibrium Form

For a system in **virial equilibrium** (steady state or time-averaged over long periods), $\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} \approx 0$:

$$\boxed{2K + U = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2\langle K \rangle = -\langle U \rangle}$$

where $U$ represents the potential energy (related to internal forces).

## Physical Interpretation

- **For gravitational systems**: $2K + U = 0$ means the total kinetic energy equals half the magnitude of gravitational potential energy
- This relates the internal motion (temperature/velocity) to the gravitational binding energy
- Used to estimate galaxy masses from rotation curves or velocity dispersions",0.546
3,"<image>GSTD-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, imagine a system in which photons bounce between two mirrors to measure time, with the distance between the mirrors being $L$. If the system is stationary, the round-trip path of the photon is $2L$, and the required time is $t_{0}=2L/c$. If the system is in motion with speed $v$, then when the photon travels from the first mirror to the second mirror, the system has moved from position $A$ to position $B$, and the photon travels a distance $L'$; when it returns to the first mirror, the system has moved to position $C$.

## Given Equation of Motion

$$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$$

---

## 1. Conservation of Linear Momentum

### Derivation:

Sum the equations of motion over all bodies:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$$

The right-hand side vanishes by Newton's third law (each pair $i,j$ contributes equal and opposite forces):

$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = 0$$

### **First Integral: Total Linear Momentum**
$$\boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}}$$

This gives **3 conserved quantities** (one per Cartesian component).

---

## 2. Conservation of Angular Momentum

### Derivation:

Cross multiply the equation of motion by $\mathbf{r}_i$:
$$m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\mathbf{r}_{i} \times\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$$

Since $\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j$, sum over all $i$:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\mathbf{r}_{i} \times \mathbf{r}_{j}$$

By symmetry (swapping $i \leftrightarrow j$), the right side cancels:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = 0$$

### **Second Integral: Total Angular Momentum**
$$\boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = \text{constant}}$$

This gives **3 conserved quantities**.

## 3. Conservation of Energy

### Derivation:

Multiply the equation of motion by $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$ and sum:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}|^2\right) = \frac{dT}{dt}$$

For the right side, note that:
$$\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} \cdot(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}) = \frac{d}{dt}|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}|^2/2$$

Therefore:

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"# Proof of Perihelion and Aphelion Velocities

I'll prove these velocity formulas using the principles of orbital mechanics, specifically conservation of energy and angular momentum.

## Given Information
- Elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$
- Standard gravitational parameter: $\mu = GM$ (where $G$ is gravitational constant, $M$ is central body mass)
- Aphelion distance: $r_A = a(1+e)$
- Perihelion distance: $r_P = a(1-e)$

## Proof

### Step 1: Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum

At perihelion and aphelion, velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector, so:

$$L = m r_P v_P = m r_A v_A$$

Therefore:
$$r_P v_P = r_A v_A$$

$$a(1-e)v_P = a(1+e)v_A$$

$$v_P = \frac{1+e}{1-e}v_A \quad \text{...(1)}$$

### Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy

The specific orbital energy is constant throughout the orbit:

$$E = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

At perihelion:
$$\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1-e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1}{1-e} - \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2-(1-e)}{2(1-e)}\right)$$

$$v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\cdot\frac{2(1+e)}{2(1-e)}$$

$$\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}}$$

### Step 3: Find Aphelion Velocity

At aphelion:
$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1+e)} - \frac{\mu}{2a}$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{1}{1+e} - \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\frac{v_A^2}{2} = \frac{\mu}{a}\left(\frac{2-(1+e)}{2(1+e)}\right)$$

$$v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a}\cdot\frac{2(1-e)}{2(1+e)}$$

$$\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}}$$

## Verification

We can verify using equation (1):
$$\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}} \div \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}$$ ✓

Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$, find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet.","According to: 

Due to the symmetry, and using Gauss' Law for gravitation, we know that the gravity at a distance $d$ from the center is given by $g\cdot S=-4\pi GM_{in}.$ Our Gaussian shape will thus be a cylinder of radius $d$ and length $L.$ So, $S=2\pi dL$, and the internal mass is given by $M_{in}=\rho\pi R^{2}L.$

Conclude: 

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"# Solution: Period-Distance Relationship for a Cylindrical Planet's Satellite

## Step 1: Gravitational Force on the Satellite

For a satellite at distance $d$ from the axis of a very long cylindrical planet, we need to find the gravitational force per unit length of the cylinder.

The gravitational field at distance $d$ from an infinite cylinder of radius $R$ and uniform density $\rho$ is:

$$g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}$$

This comes from the fact that only the cylindrical shell of radius $R$ contributes to the field (shell theorem for cylinders), and the field follows a $1/d$ dependence rather than $1/d^2$.

## Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law for Circular Orbit

For a satellite in circular orbit at distance $d$, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$mg(d) = m\omega^2 d$$

where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{P}$ is the angular velocity.

## Step 3: Substitute the Gravitational Field

$$\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d} = \omega^2 d$$

$$\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2}{P^2} d$$

## Step 4: Solve for Period P

$$2\pi G \rho R^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{P^2} d^2$$

$$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2}$$

$$P^2 = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}$$

## Final Result

$$\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}} = d\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}}$$

The spiral galaxies are uniformly rotating, so we can simply write.

- Rotational velocity at distance R: v
- Dynamics: Rotational (disk galaxy)

### Solution:

For a rotating disk galaxy, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{GM_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$

Solving for mass:

$$\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** In a spiral galaxy, stars orbit in circular paths. The rotation curve relates orbital velocity directly to the enclosed mass.

## **Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)**

### Given Information:
- Radius: R
- Radial velocity dispersion: σ = v
- Dynamics: Random motions (pressure support)
- Composition: Uniform, evenly-spaced stars

### Solution:

For a spherical system in hydrostatic equilibrium, the **Virial Theorem** relates velocity dispersion to mass:

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{GM}{3R}$$

This comes from balancing the kinetic energy of random motions against gravitational binding energy.

Substituting σ = v:

$$v^2 = \frac{GM_B}{3R}$$

Solving for mass:

$$\boxed{M_B = \frac{3v^2 R}{G}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** In an elliptical galaxy, stars have random velocities (velocity dispersion) rather than organized rotation. The virial relation includes the factor of 3 because random motions in 3D space require more mass to maintain the same velocity dispersion.

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"# Solution: Density of a White Dwarf

I'll solve this step-by-step by balancing the electron degeneracy pressure with gravitational pressure.

## Step 1: Set Up the Pressure Balance Equation

At equilibrium, the electron degeneracy pressure equals the gravitational pressure:

$$p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}|$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{\Omega}{3V} = \frac{3GM^2}{5R \cdot 3V}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5RV}$$

## Step 2: Relate Volume to Radius

For a spherical star:
$$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5R \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$$

## Step 3: Express Number Density in Terms of Mass

The total mass of the star relates to electron number density through:
$$M = N_{\text{nucleons}} \cdot m_u = n_{\text{nucleons}} \cdot V \cdot m_u$$

where $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit.

Since each nucleus has mass number $A$ and charge $Ze$ (with $Z$ electrons per nucleus):
$$n_{\text{nucleons}} = \frac{n}{Z} \cdot A$$

Therefore:
$$M = \frac{n \cdot A}{Z} \cdot V \cdot m_u \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{ZM}{A m_u V}$$

## Step 4: Substitute and Solve for R

Substituting the expression for $n$ into the pressure balance:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{ZM}{A m_u V}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$$

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \frac{Z^{5/3}M^{5/3}}{A^{5/3}m_u^{5/3}V^{5/3}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$$

Using $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$:

$$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \frac{Z^{5/3}M^{5/3}}{A^{5/3}m_u^{5/3}\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)^{5/3}R^5} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}$$

Solving for $R^4$:

$$R \propto \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{Gm_e m_u^{5/3}}\right)^{3/5} \frac{1}{M^{1/3}} \left(\frac{Z}{A}\right)$$

## Step 5: Calculate the Density

The density is:
$$\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \propto M \cdot R^{-3} \propto M \cdot M \propto M^{1/3}$$

**Final Result:**

$$\boxed{\rho = C \left(\frac{A}{Z}\right)^3 \left(\frac{GM m_u}{A}\right)^2}$$

Or in more explicit form:

$$\boxed{\rho \propto \left(\frac{A}{Z}\right)^3 M^2}$$

where the proportionality constant involves $\hbar$, $m_e$, $m_u$, and $G$.

**Key insight:** The white dwarf density increases dramatically with mass ($\propto M^2$) and depends on the nuclear composition through the ratio $A/Z$. Higher $Z$ (more protons) means more electrons for pressure support, allowing the star to support greater mass at lower density.",0.637

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"# Solution to the Meteorite-Space Station Collision Problem

## Step 1: Analyze the Orbital Shape

**Shape of the conglomerate's orbit:** The orbit is an **ellipse**.

This is because:
- The perihelion (minimum distance) = R/2
- The conglomerate has a closed orbit
- By definition, an ellipse has two distinct focal points and varying distances from the focus

## Step 2: Define Elliptical Parameters

For the ellipse with Earth at one focus:
- **Perihelion distance:** $r_p = \frac{R}{2}$
- **Aphelion distance:** $r_a$ (to be determined)
- **Semi-major axis:** $a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} = \frac{R/2 + r_a}{2}$

## Step 3: Solve Part (i) - Speed of Meteorite Before Collision

**Before collision:**
- Space station orbits at radius R with speed: $v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$
- Meteorite approaches radially with speed $v_m$ (to find)

**At collision (using conservation of momentum):**

The momentum component tangential to the orbit (perpendicular to the radial direction) is conserved:
$$m_1 \cdot 0 + m_2 v_0 = (m_1 + m_2)v_{\perp}$$

where $v_{\perp}$ is the tangential velocity of the conglomerate after collision.

$$v_{\perp} = \frac{m_2 v_0}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

**At perihelion (R/2), using angular momentum conservation:**

$$L = (m_1 + m_2) \cdot \frac{R}{2} \cdot v_{min}$$

where $v_{min}$ is the speed at perihelion (minimum speed).

From the tangential component at R:
$$L = (m_1 + m_2) \cdot R \cdot v_{\perp} = m_2 R \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = m_2\sqrt{GMR}$$

Therefore:
$$v_{min} = \frac{m_2\sqrt{GMR}}{(m_1 + m_2) \cdot R/2} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

**Using energy conservation:**

At collision point (R), the conglomerate has:
- Tangential velocity: $v_{\perp}$
- Radial velocity: $v_r$ (unknown)
- Total energy: $E = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)(v_r^2 + v_{\perp}^2) - \frac{GMm_1m_2}{R}$

Wait, I need to reconsider. Let me use energy conservation directly.

**Energy before collision:**
$$E_{before} = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_0^2 - \frac{GMm_2}{R} - \frac{GMm_1}{\infty}$$

$$E_{before} = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GMm_2}{R}$$

**Energy at perihelion (R/2):**
$$E_{perihelion} = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_{min}^2 - \frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R/2}$$

From energy conservation and using $v_{min} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$:

$$\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)v_{min}^2 - \frac{GMm_2}{R} - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_m^2 = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2)\frac{4m_2^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GMm_2}{R} - \frac{2GM(m_1 + m_2)}{R}$$

$$v_m = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\sqrt{\frac{4m_2^2 + m_1(3m_1 + 4m_2)}{m_1(m_1 + m_2)}}$$

**Answer (i):**
$$\boxed{v_m = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\cdot\frac{(3m_1 + 4m_2)m_1 + 4m_2^2}{m_1(m_1 + m_2)}}}$$

Or more simply after simplification:
$$\boxed{v_m = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}\left(3 + \frac{4m_2}{m_1}\right)}}$$

## Step 4: Solve Part (ii) - Minimum and Maximum Speeds

**Minimum speed (at perihelion, R/2):**
$$\boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$$

**Maximum speed (at aphelion, $r_a$):**

Using angular momentum: $v_{max} = \frac{m_2\sqrt{GMR}}{(m_1 + m_2) \cdot r_a}$

We need to find $r_a$ first using energy conservation.

## Step 5: Solve Part (iii) - Maximum Distance

Using the vis-viva equation and energy conservation:

$$a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2}$$

From orbital energy: $E = -\frac{GM(m_1 + m_2)}{2a}$

This equals the energy at perihelion, allowing us to solve for $r_a$:

$$\boxed{r_a = R\frac{m_1 + 4m_2}{3m_1 + 4m_2}}$$

$$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{m_2(3m_1 + 4m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)(m_1 + 4m_2)}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$$

## Step 6: Condition on Masses

For the described scenario to be possible:

1. The aphelion must be outside the initial orbit: $r_a > R/2$ ✓ (always satisfied)

2. **Physical constraint:** $r_a > R/2$ requires:
$$\frac{m_1 + 4m_2}{3m_1 + 4m_2} > \frac{1}{2}$$

$$2(m_1 + 4m_2) > 3m_1 + 4m_2$$

$$\boxed{m_2 > \frac{m_1}{4}} \text{ or } \boxed{4m_2 > m_1}$$

**Physical interpretation:** The meteorite cannot be too massive compared to the space station, otherwise the collision would transfer too much radial momentum and create a hyperbolic trajectory instead of an ellipse.",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

where $M_{total}$ is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy.

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"# Solution: Surface Magnitude Independence from Distance

I'll demonstrate that surface magnitude is distance-independent in a non-expanding universe.

## Step 1: Define the Relevant Quantities

Let me establish the key parameters:
- **Apparent magnitude**: $m$ (what we observe)
- **Absolute magnitude**: $M$ (intrinsic brightness)
- **Distance**: $d$
- **Solid angle subtended**: $\Omega$ (in steradians)
- **Surface magnitude**: $\mu$ (magnitude per unit solid angle)

## Step 2: Recall the Distance Modulus

The apparent magnitude relates to absolute magnitude through:
$$m = M + 5\log_{10}(d) - 5$$

where $d$ is distance in parsecs.

## Step 3: Analyze the Flux Relationship

The total flux received from the galaxy is:
$$F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$$

where $L$ is the luminosity.

The **flux per unit solid angle** (surface brightness) is:
$$F_\text{surf} = \frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2 \Omega}$$

## Step 4: Key Insight - Solid Angle Scaling

In a non-expanding universe, when a galaxy is at distance $d$:
- Its physical size remains constant: $r = $ constant
- Its solid angle scales as: 
$$\Omega = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{distance}^2} = \frac{\pi r^2}{d^2} \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$$

## Step 5: Calculate Surface Brightness

Substituting the solid angle relation:
$$F_\text{surf} = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2 \cdot \Omega} = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \cdot \frac{d^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi^2 r^2}$$

**The $d^2$ factors cancel!**

## Step 6: Express as Surface Magnitude

Since magnitude is defined as:
$$\mu = -2.5\log_{10}(F_\text{surf}) + \text{constant}$$

And $F_\text{surf}$ depends **only on** $L$ and $r$ (the galaxy's intrinsic properties):

$$\boxed{\mu = -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{4\pi^2 r^2}\right) + \text{constant}}$$

## Conclusion

$$\mu \text{ is independent of distance } d$$

**Physical Interpretation**: As a galaxy recedes, two competing effects occur:
1. Its total flux decreases as $1/d^2$ (making it dimmer)
2. Its solid angle decreases as $1/d^2$ (spreading the light over a smaller area)

These effects **exactly cancel**, leaving the surface brightness (and therefore surface magnitude) constant regardless of distance.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Conclude:

$T^{2} = \left( \frac{2\pi ab}{h} \right)^{2}
= \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{2}b^{2}}{h^{2}}

## Starting Point: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

$$F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{r}$$

where:
- G is the gravitational constant
- M is the mass of the central body (sun)
- m is the mass of the orbiting body (planet)
- r is the distance between them

## **Kepler's First Law: Orbits are Ellipses**

### Setup using Central Force Motion

For a central force, angular momentum is conserved:
$$L = mr^2\dot{\theta} = \text{constant}$$

Using the orbit equation in polar coordinates, the gravitational force leads to:

$$\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{L^2/(m^2)}$$

where $u = 1/r$

### Solution

This is a second-order linear ODE with solution:

$$u = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM m^2}{L^2}(1 + e\cos\theta)$$

Rearranging:

$$r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$

This is the **equation of a conic section** where:
- $a = \frac{L^2}{GMm^2(1-e^2)}$ (semi-major axis)
- $e$ is the eccentricity
- When $0 \leq e < 1$: **Ellipse** ✓

## **Kepler's Second Law: Equal Areas in Equal Times**

### Derivation

The area swept by the radius vector in time $dt$ is:

$$dA = \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta$$

The rate of area coverage:

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$

Since angular momentum $L = mr^2\dot{\theta}$ is conserved:

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} = \text{constant}$$

**Conclusion**: The radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 

**Kepler's Second Law is derived.** ✓

---

## **Kepler's Third Law: Period-Semimajor Axis Relation**

### Derivation using Conservation Laws

The total area of an ellipse is:
$$A = \pi ab = \pi a^2\sqrt{1-e^2}$$

where $b = a\sqrt{1-e^2}$ (semi-minor axis)

The period T is the time to sweep the entire area:

$$T = \frac{A}{dA/dt} = \frac{\pi a^2\sqrt{1-e^2}}{L/(2m)}$$

From our earlier relation:
$$L = m\sqrt{GMa(1-e^2)}$$

Substituting:

$$T = \frac{\pi a^2\sqrt{1-e^2}}{m\sqrt{GMa(1-e^2)}/(2m)} = \frac{2\pi a^2\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\sqrt{GMa(1-e^2)}}$$

$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}}$$

### Final Form

Squaring both sides:

$$\boxed{T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}a^3}$$

Or, the ratio form:

$$\boxed{\frac{T^2}{a^3} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} = \text{constant}}$$

**Kepler's Third Law is derived.** ✓

18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071
19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

(II) If the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at the centre, then we consider Keplerian motion. $V=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\to\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}.$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"# Solution: Deriving the Radial Gradient of Rotational Velocity

I'll derive the expressions for $\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}$ for both cases by connecting Oort's constants to the rotation curve.

## Step 1: Establish the Relationship Between Oort Constants and Galaxy Dynamics

For a circular orbit, the centripetal force equals gravitational force:
$$V^2 = \Omega^2 R^2$$

Therefore:
$$\Omega = \frac{V}{R}$$

At the Sun's location:
$$\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}$$

## Step 2: Derive Oort Constants from First Principles

Using the exact formulas with the small difference approximation, we expand $\Omega - \Omega_0$ for nearby clouds where $R \approx R_0 + \Delta R$ and $D \ll R_0$.

The key relationships are:
- $A = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{2R_0}$
- $B = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}$

From these two equations, we can derive:

$$A - B = -\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}$$

Therefore:

$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} = B - A}$$

## Step 3: Case (I) - Actual Rotation Curve

For the Galaxy with dark matter, observational data shows that the rotation curve is approximately **flat** in the solar neighborhood. This means:

$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} \approx 0}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The flat rotation curve indicates the presence of dark matter, which extends the distribution of mass beyond the visible disk. This additional mass compensates for the gradient that would exist if mass were concentrated in the disk alone.

## Step 4: Case (II) - Hypothetical Scenario (Mass Concentrated at Center)

For a point mass $M$ at the Galactic center:
$$V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$

Taking the derivative:
$$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}\left(\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{V}{2R}$$

At the Sun's location:
$$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The negative gradient reflects a Keplerian velocity profile. With all mass concentrated at the center, rotation velocity decreases with distance, proportional to $R^{-1/2}$. Given $V_0 \approx 220$ km/s and $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc:

$$\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} \approx -\frac{220}{2 \times 8.5} \approx -12.9 \text{ km/s/kpc}$$

## Summary

20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

$\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{t}}&=(\Omega-\Omega_0)R_0\cos l-\Omega D=\frac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](-D\cos l)R_0\cos l-\Omega_0i=\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D\cos^2l-\Omega_0D=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D(1+\cos2l)-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right]D-\frac{V_0}{R_0}D=AD\cos2l-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_0}{R_0}+\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}D\end{aligned}$

I'll systematically derive expressions for Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ using first-order approximations.

## Step 1: Establish the Geometric Relationship

For an HI cloud at Galactic longitude $l$, distance $D$ from the Sun, and distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre:

Using the geometry in the Galactic plane:
$$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2R_0 D\cos l$$

For $D \ll R_0$, expanding to first order in $D/R_0$:
$$R = R_0 - D\cos l + O(D^2)$$

## Step 2: Expand Angular Velocity

The angular velocity of the cloud is:
$$\Omega = \frac{V(R)}{R}$$

Expanding $V(R)$ around $R_0$ to first order:
$$V(R) = V_0 + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}(R - R_0) + O(D^2)$$

$$V(R) = V_0 + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}(-D\cos l)$$

Therefore:
$$\Omega = \frac{V(R)}{R} = \frac{V_0 - D\cos l \cdot \frac{dV}{dR}}{R_0 - D\cos l}$$

To first order in $D/R_0$:
$$\Omega = \frac{\Omega_0}{1 - \frac{D\cos l}{R_0}}\left(1 - \frac{D\cos l}{R_0}\cdot\frac{1}{V_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

$$\Omega \approx \Omega_0\left(1 + \frac{D\cos l}{R_0}\right)\left(1 - \frac{D\cos l}{R_0}\cdot\frac{1}{V_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

## Step 3: Calculate $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$

To first order:
$$\Omega - \Omega_0 = \Omega_0\frac{D\cos l}{R_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{V_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

$$\Omega - \Omega_0 = \frac{D\cos l}{R_0}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{R_0}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

## Step 4: Substitute into Line-of-Sight Velocity

$$V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\sin l = D\cos l\sin l\left(V_0/R_0 - \frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

Using $\sin l\cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2l$:

$$V_r = \frac{D}{2}\sin 2l\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\right)$$

Therefore: $$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right)}$$

## Step 5: Calculate Transverse Velocity

$$V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0)R_0\cos l - \Omega D$$

$$V_t = D\cos^2 l\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\right) - \frac{V_0 + \text{correction terms}}{1 \approx 1}D$$

To first order in $D$:
$$V_t = D\cos^2 l\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\right) - V_0 D$$

$$V_t = D\left[\cos^2 l\frac{V_0}{R_0} - V_0 - \cos^2 l\frac{dV}{dR}\right]$$

Using $\cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2}$:

$$V_t = D\left[-\frac{V_0}{2} + \frac{V_0}{2R_0}\cos 2l\right] + \text{higher order terms} = AD\cos 2l + BD$$

Therefore: $$\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right)}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}\right)}$$

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$",No,"# Solution: Total Mechanical Energy Released During Accretion

## Step 1: Establish the Energy Components

For a gas element in a Keplerian circular orbit, the total mechanical energy per unit mass consists of:
- **Kinetic energy**: $\epsilon_k = \frac{v^2}{2}$
- **Gravitational potential energy**: $\epsilon_p = -\frac{GM}{r}$

## Step 2: Apply Kepler's Law

For a circular orbit, the orbital velocity satisfies:
$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

This comes from balancing gravitational force with centripetal acceleration.

## Step 3: Calculate Total Mechanical Energy at Radius r

The total mechanical energy per unit mass at orbital radius $r$ is:

$$\frac{\epsilon_{total}(r)}{\Delta m} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r}$$

Substituting the Keplerian velocity:

$$\frac{\epsilon_{total}(r)}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}$$

## Step 4: Calculate Initial and Final States

**At initial radius $R_{max}$:**
$$\frac{\epsilon_{total}(R_{max})}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}$$

**At final radius $r$:**
$$\frac{\epsilon_{total}(r)}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{2r}$$

## Step 5: Find Energy Released

The energy released (converted to internal energy via viscous dissipation) is the decrease in mechanical energy:

$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{\epsilon_{total}(R_{max}) - \epsilon_{total}(r)}{1} = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{max}}}$$

## Final Answer (Simplified)

Since $r \ll R_{max}$, we have $\frac{1}{R_{max}} \ll \frac{1}{r}$, so:

$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}}$$

Or in exact form:

$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2}\left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}}\right)}$$

## Physical Interpretation

- The energy released increases as the gas spirals inward to smaller radii (where $r$ is smaller)
- This is the source of the enormous radiative power in accretion systems
- The efficiency depends on the ratio $r/R_{max}$; for $r \ll R_{max}$, nearly all the binding energy difference is released",0.728

## Step 1: Set Up the Problem

In a Steady-State Universe, the distance between Earth and the mirror evolves according to:
$$S(t) = s \cdot e^{H_0 t}$$

where:
- $s = D$ is the initial separation
- $H_0$ is the Hubble constant we want to find
- $t$ is time

## Step 2: Analyze the Light Journey

The total time $T$ consists of two parts:

**Outbound journey (time $t_1$):**
- Light travels to the mirror at distance $D$
- During this time, the mirror recedes due to expansion
- At time $t_1$, the light reaches the mirror at distance: $S(t_1) = D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1}$

The outbound light travel satisfies:
$$c \cdot t_1 = D \cdot e^{H_0 t_1}$$

**Return journey (time $t_2$):**
- Light travels from the mirror (now at a different distance) back to Earth
- At time $T = t_1 + t_2$, light returns to Earth

By symmetry in this expansion model:
$$c \cdot t_2 = D \cdot e^{H_0(t_1 + t_2)}$$

Since $t_1 = t_2 = T/2$:
$$c \cdot \frac{T}{2} = D \cdot e^{H_0 T/2}$$

## Step 3: Solve for $H_0$

From the equation above:
$$\frac{cT}{2D} = e^{H_0 T/2}$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
$$\ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right) = \frac{H_0 T}{2}$$

$$H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right)$$

## Step 4: Simplify Using the Approximation

For a weak expansion ($H_0 \ll c/D$), we have $cT \approx 2D$ (light nearly returns as if space were static), so:
$$\frac{cT}{2D} \approx 1 + \epsilon \text{ where } \epsilon \ll 1$$

Using $\ln(1 + \epsilon) \approx \epsilon$:
$$H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{cT - 2D}{2D} = \frac{cT - 2D}{DT}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T}\ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right)}$$

Or in the weak-expansion approximation:
$$\boxed{H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}}$$

**Physical Interpretation:** The Hubble constant is determined by comparing the round-trip light travel time $T$ with the initial distance $D$. The expansion of space causes the return journey to take slightly longer than expected in a static universe, revealing $H_0$.",0.728

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^\alpha (cR)^\beta M^\gamma$

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved: 

- For $[M]$: $1 = -\alpha + \gamma$, so $\gamma = 1 + \alpha$;
- For $[L]$: $2 = 3\alpha + 2\beta$;
- For $[T]$: $-3 = -2\alpha - \beta$.

According to: 

Adding twice the equation for $[T]$ to that for $[L]$ gives $-4 = -\alpha$ so $\alpha = 4$, $\beta = -5$, and $\gamma = 5$

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"# Solution: Deriving the Gravitational Wave Luminosity Expression

## Step 1: Dimensional Analysis Setup

We need to find an expression of the form:
$$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^d \cdot R^e$$

where the exponents $a, b, d, e$ are to be determined, with the constraint that **$c$ and $R$ have the same power**: $b = e$.

## Step 2: Identify Dimensions

Let me establish the dimensions of each quantity:

| Quantity | Dimension |
|----------|-----------|
| $L_{GW}$ (Power/Luminosity) | $[M L^2 T^{-3}]$ |
| $G$ | $[M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]$ |
| $c$ (velocity) | $[L T^{-1}]$ |
| $M$ (mass) | $[M]$ |
| $R$ (length) | $[L]$ |

## Step 3: Set Up Dimensional Equation

$$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]^a \cdot [L T^{-1}]^b \cdot [M]^d \cdot [L]^b$$

Expanding the right side:
$$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a} \cdot L^b T^{-b} \cdot M^d \cdot L^b$$

$$[M L^2 T^{-3}] = M^{-a+d} \cdot L^{3a+2b} \cdot T^{-2a-b}$$

## Step 4: Match Exponents

Equating exponents on both sides:

**Mass:** 
$$1 = -a + d \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = 1 + a$$

**Time:** 
$$-3 = -2a - b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2a + b = 3$$

**Length:** 
$$2 = 3a + 2b$$

## Step 5: Solve the System

From the time equation: $b = 3 - 2a$

Substitute into the length equation:
$$2 = 3a + 2(3 - 2a)$$
$$2 = 3a + 6 - 4a$$
$$2 = -a + 6$$
$$a = 4$$

Therefore:
- $a = 4$
- $b = 3 - 2(4) = -5$
- $d = 1 + 4 = 5$
- $e = b = -5$ (by the given constraint)

## Step 6: Verify Dimensions

$$L_{GW} = G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5} = \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}$$

Check: $\left[\frac{M^{-4}L^{12}T^{-8} \cdot M^5}{L^{-5}T^5 \cdot L^{-5}}\right] = [M L^2 T^{-3}]$ ✓

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}$$

This is the famous formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a binary system. It shows that:
- Luminosity increases with the fifth power of mass
- Luminosity decreases sharply with the fifth power of separation
- The system loses energy rapidly as the separation decreases, causing orbital decay",0.637
27,"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to: 

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

In this case, $m = M$ and $a = 2R$ so $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$. $L_{GW} = -\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$, so $\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} L_{GW} = -\frac{4R^2}{GM^2} \frac{2G^4M^5}{5R^5c^5}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"# Solution: Rate of Change of Orbital Radius Due to Gravitational Wave Radiation

## Step 1: Establish the Energy-Orbit Relation

For a binary system with two identical masses $M$ in circular orbits around their center of mass, each star orbits at radius $R$ from the center of mass.

The total orbital energy is:
$$E = -\frac{GM^2}{2R}$$

(This accounts for the gravitational potential energy of the system with separation $2R$)

## Step 2: Apply Energy Conservation

The energy loss rate due to gravitational wave radiation equals the power radiated:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$$

where $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$ (given expression)

## Step 3: Differentiate the Energy Expression

Using the chain rule with the hint provided:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(-\frac{GM^2}{2R}\right)$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(R^{-1})$$

Applying the hint with $\alpha = -1$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{GM^2}{2} \cdot (-1)R^{-2}\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$$

## Step 4: Set Equal and Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$

$$\frac{GM^2}{2R^2}\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$$

Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{2R^2}{GM^2}$$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4G^3 M^3}{5c^5 R^3}$$

## Final Answer

$$\boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{4G^3 M^3}{5c^5 R^3}}$$

The negative sign indicates that the orbital radius decreases with time as energy is radiated away through gravitational waves. This effect causes the neutron stars to gradually spiral inward toward each other.",0.49
