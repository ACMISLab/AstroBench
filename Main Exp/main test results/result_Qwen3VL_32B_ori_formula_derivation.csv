2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

## Step 1: Newton’s Second Law for a Single Particle

For a single particle of mass $ m $, Newton’s second law states:

$$
\vec{F} = m \frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2}
$$

where:
- $ \vec{r} $ is the position vector of the particle relative to some origin,
- $ \vec{F} $ is the total force acting on the particle (due to all other particles in the system),
- $ m $ is the mass of the particle.

---

## Step 2: Take the Dot Product with Position Vector

Multiply both sides of Newton’s second law by the position vector $ \vec{r} $:

$$
\vec{r} \cdot \vec{F} = m \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2}
$$

---

## Step 3: Consider the Time Derivative of $ \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} $

We know from calculus that:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right) = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} + \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = \left| \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right|^2 + \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\vec{r} \cdot \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right) - \left| \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right|^2
$$

Substitute this into the equation from Step 2:

$$
\vec{r} \cdot \vec{F} = m \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \vec{r} \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right) - \left| \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right|^2 \right]
$$

---

## Step 4: Sum Over All Particles in the System

Let there be $ N $ particles in the system. Sum over all particles:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} \right) - \left| \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2 \right]
$$

The left-hand side is the **virial** $ G $, as defined in the question:

$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i
$$

The right-hand side becomes:

$$
G = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} \right) - \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \left| \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2
$$

Note that $ \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \left| \frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt} \right|^2 = 2T $, where $ T $ is the total kinetic energy of the system (since $ T = \frac{1}{2} \sum m_i v_i^2 $).

So,

$$
G = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i \right) - 2T
$$

---

## Step 5: Assume Steady-State or Time-Averaged Behavior

In many physical systems (like galaxies or stars), we assume that the system is in a **quasi-static equilibrium** — meaning that macroscopic quantities like the virial do not change significantly over time. Therefore, we take the **time average** of both sides over a long period.

If the system is steady, then the time derivative term averages to zero:

$$
\langle \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i \right) \rangle = 0
$$

Thus, the time-averaged virial equals twice the time-averaged kinetic energy:

$$
\langle G \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
$$

Wait — here's a sign issue. Let me double-check.

Actually, recall that the force $ \vec{F}_i $ is derived from a potential $ U $, so:

$$
\vec{F}_i = -\nabla_i U
$$

Then,

$$
\vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = - \vec{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U
$$

And for central forces (like gravity), it can be shown that:

$$
\sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = - \sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \vec{r}_{ij} \cdot \nabla_i U_{ij}
$$

But more simply, in classical mechanics, the **virial theorem** for a system with pairwise central forces (like gravity) is often stated as:

> For a system in steady state, the time-averaged kinetic energy $ \langle T \rangle $ and potential energy $ \langle U \rangle $ are related by:
>
> $$
> 2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle \sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i \rangle
> $$

That is:

$$
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle G \rangle}
$$

Where $ G = \sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i $ is the virial.

This is the **classical virial theorem**.

---

## Step 6: Connection to Potential Energy (Optional but Important)

For a system where the potential energy $ U $ is due to pairwise forces that scale as $ r^n $, we have a relation between the virial and potential energy.

Specifically, for a gravitational potential ($ n = -1 $), it turns out that:

$$
\sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = - \sum_{i<j} \vec{r}_{ij} \cdot \nabla_i U_{ij} = - \sum_{i<j} \vec{r}_{ij} \cdot \left( -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2} \hat{r}_{ij} \right)
$$

Since $ \vec{r}_{ij} = \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j $, and $ \hat{r}_{ij} = \frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{|\vec{r}_{ij}|} $, then:

$$
\vec{r}_{ij} \cdot \hat{r}_{ij} = r_{ij}
$$

So,

$$
\vec{r}_{ij} \cdot \left( -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2} \hat{r}_{ij} \right) = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}}
$$

Thus,

$$
\sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = - \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} = -U
$$

Therefore, for a gravitational system:

$$
\langle G \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
$$

Combining with the virial theorem:

$$
2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle G \rangle = \langle U \rangle
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle U \rangle}
$$

This is the **virial theorem for self-gravitating systems** — a cornerstone in astrophysics for estimating galaxy masses.

## Final Answer:

Starting from Newton’s second law, we derived the **virial theorem** as follows:

1. For each particle: $ \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i = m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \vec{r}_i}{dt^2} $
2. Used identity: $ \vec{r}_i \cdot \frac{d^2 \vec{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i \right) - |\vec{v}_i|^2 $
3. Summed over all particles: $ G = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum m_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{v}_i \right) - 2T $
4. Averaged over time: assuming steady-state, time derivative vanishes → $ \langle G \rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle $

Thus, the **virial theorem** is:

$$
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle = - \langle G \rangle}
$$

where $ G = \sum_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{F}_i $ is the virial, and $ T $ is the total kinetic energy.

For self-gravitating systems (e.g., galaxies), if the potential energy is $ U $, then $ \langle G \rangle = - \langle U \rangle $, leading to:

$$
\boxed{2 \langle T \rangle = \langle U \rangle}
$$

This relationship allows astronomers to estimate the total mass of galaxies by measuring the velocities (kinetic energy) of stars or gas clouds within them.",0.546

Let the N-body potential function be:

Conclude:

According to:

that is:

$\mathrm{d} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 \right) = - \frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i^\top} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i \text{,} \qquad i = 1, 2, \cdots, N$

According to: 

Summing over all bodies

Conclude: 

$\mathrm{d} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 = - \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i^\top} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathrm{d} V$

Integrating yields the energy integral:
$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + V = \varepsilon$",No,"We are given the equation of motion for each body $ i $ in an N-body gravitational system:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j), \quad i = 1,2,\dots,N
$$

Our goal is to **derive the first integrals of motion** — that is, conserved quantities (constants of motion) that remain unchanged throughout the evolution of the system.

---

## Step 1: Understand the nature of the forces

The force on body $ i $ due to body $ j $ is:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

This is a **central force**, directed along the line joining the two bodies, and it satisfies **Newton’s third law**: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji} $. Also, the force is **conservative**, since it can be derived from a potential energy function:

$$
U_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Thus, the total potential energy is:

$$
U = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

And the total kinetic energy is:

$$
T = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2
$$

So the system has a Lagrangian:

$$
L = T - U = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

---

## Step 2: Use Noether’s Theorem or direct integration to find conserved quantities

Since the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on time, space translations, or rotations (i.e., it's invariant under these transformations), we expect conservation laws corresponding to:

- **Time translation invariance** → Conservation of **energy**
- **Spatial translation invariance** → Conservation of **linear momentum**
- **Rotational invariance** → Conservation of **angular momentum**

Let’s derive them directly from Newton’s equations.

---

## Step 3: Conservation of Linear Momentum

Sum the equations of motion over all bodies:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Note that for every pair $ (i,j) $, the term appears twice: once as $ (i,j) $ and once as $ (j,i) $. But observe:

$$
\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = 0
$$

since $ |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i| $ and $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $.

Therefore, the right-hand side sums to zero.

Hence:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0
$$

So **total linear momentum** is conserved:

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}}
$$

---

## Step 4: Conservation of Angular Momentum

Compute the total angular momentum:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Take its time derivative:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i) \right)
$$

The first term vanishes because $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 $, so:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Now plug in Newton’s law:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right)
$$

Interchange summations:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

But note:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j
$$

So:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Now consider swapping indices $ i \leftrightarrow j $. The double sum runs over all ordered pairs $ (i,j) $ with $ i \ne j $. When we swap $ i $ and $ j $, the term becomes:

$$
\frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i) = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So the entire sum is equal to its negative, hence:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} \Rightarrow \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0
$$

Therefore, **total angular momentum is conserved**:

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{constant}}
$$

---

## Step 5: Conservation of Energy

The total mechanical energy is:

$$
E = T + U = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Take the time derivative:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_{i < j} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right)
$$

First term: $ \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i $

Second term: For each pair $ (i,j) $, compute derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^{-3/2} \cdot 2 (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) = -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

Now use Newton’s law: $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $

Plug into first term:

$$
\sum_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right) = -\sum_i \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Now combine with the second term. Note that the double sum over $ i < j $ can be extended to all $ i \ne j $ by symmetry, but let’s write everything as sum over all $ i \ne j $:

The full expression becomes:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \left[ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right] \cdot \frac{1}{2}
$$

Wait — actually, let me reorganize carefully.

From above:

First term (from acceleration):

$$
-\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Second term (from potential):

$$
\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right] = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

Which equals:

$$
\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} + \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

Now extend this to all $ i \ne j $, noting that each unordered pair $ (i,j) $ appears once in $ i<j $, but in the acceleration term, each ordered pair appears.

Actually, let’s write both terms together:

Total:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} + \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

Now notice that the second sum over $ i<j $ can be rewritten as half the sum over $ i \ne j $, but perhaps easier to split the second sum into two parts:

Let’s define:

$$
S = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right] + \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

In the first part, fix $ i $, then $ j > i $; in the second part, fix $ j $, then $ i < j $, which is same as fixing $ i $, then $ j > i $, so actually:

$$
S = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left[ -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} + \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right] = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

Now combine with the first term:

Total:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

Note that $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -(\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) $, so:

$$
\sum_{i < j} \cdots = -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

But now compare to the first term. Let’s write the first term as:

$$
-\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \sum_{i > j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

In the second sum, swap $ i \leftrightarrow j $:

$$
= -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$

But $ |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i| = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| $, and $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, so:

$$
= -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So altogether:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \left[ -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right] + \left[ -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right]
$$

Now combine:

First bracket: $ \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) $

Second bracket: $ -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} $

So total:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 2 \sum_{i < j} \cdots
$$

Wait — no! Actually, they are the same term!

From above, both brackets are equal to:

$$
\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 2 \sum_{i < j} \cdots
$$

But wait — that would imply $ \frac{dE}{dt} = 2 \times \text{something} $, but earlier derivation must have error.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in splitting. Let me go back.

After combining, we had:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 2 \sum_{i < j} \cdots
$$

But this is wrong — actually, the two terms are identical, so:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 2 \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

But this is NOT zero! What’s going on?

Wait — no, I think I messed up the signs.

Let me restart the energy derivative more carefully.

We have:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_{i<j} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right)
$$

Second term:

$$
\sum_{i<j} G m_i m_j \cdot \left( -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right)
$$

First term: using Newton’s law:

$$
\sum_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right) = -\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Now write this as:

$$
-\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \sum_{i>j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

In the second sum, swap $ i \leftrightarrow j $:

$$
= -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$

Since $ |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i| = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| $, and $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, we get:

$$
= -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So:

$$
\sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Now add the potential derivative:

$$
\sum_{i<j} G m_i m_j \left( -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right) = \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Exactly the same as above!

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 2 \sum_{i<j} \cdots
$$

Wait — no! The two terms are **identical**, so:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = 2 \sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

But this is **not** zero — unless I made a mistake.

Actually, I see the error: the potential derivative term is already included in the total derivative, and the acceleration term is from Newton’s law, so when you put them together, they should cancel.

Let me check with a simple case: two bodies.

Let N=2.

Then:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = m_1 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 + m_2 \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_2 + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} \right)
$$

From Newton’s law:

$$
m_1 \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2)
$$

$$
m_2 \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1) = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2)
$$

So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = - \frac{G m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1
$$

$$
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = \frac{G m_1}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2
$$

So:

$$
\sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 + \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1)
$$

Potential derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} \right) = G m_1 m_2 \left( -\frac{(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_1 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_2)}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} \right) = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1) + \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1) = 2 \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|^3} (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_2 - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_1)
$$

Still not zero? That can’t be.

Wait — I see the mistake: in the potential derivative, it's only one term for the pair, but in the kinetic part, I have two terms, and they are not cancelling.

Actually, for two bodies, the total energy derivative should be zero.

Let me compute numerically.

Let’s take $ \mathbf{r}_1 = (x,0), \mathbf{r}_2 = (0,0) $, so $ \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 = (x,0) $, $ |\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2| = x $

Then:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x} \right) = -G m_1 m_2 \frac{\dot{x}}{x^2}
$$

Kinetic energy derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{x}^2 \right) = m_1 \dot{x} \ddot{x}
$$

From Newton’s law:

$$
m_1 \ddot{x} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x^2}
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} T = m_1 \dot{x} \left( - \frac{G m_2}{x^2} \right)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} = -2 \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2}
$$

This is not zero! But that can't be — energy should be conserved in conservative systems.

Ah! I see the error: in the potential derivative, I forgot that the potential is only between the two bodies, but in the kinetic part, I have the full kinetic energy, and I used Newton’s law correctly.

But according to calculation, $ \frac{dE}{dt} = -2 \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} $, which is not zero.

But this is impossible — energy must be conserved.

Let me check the potential derivative again.

If $ \mathbf{r}_1 = (x,0), \mathbf{r}_2 = (0,0) $, then $ |\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2| = x $, so $ U = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x} $, so $ \frac{dU}{dt} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{x^2} \dot{x} $

Kinetic energy: $ T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{x}^2 $, so $ \frac{dT}{dt} = m_1 \dot{x} \ddot{x} $

From Newton’s law: $ m_1 \ddot{x} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x^2} $, so $ \frac{dT}{dt} = m_1 \dot{x} \left( - \frac{G m_2}{x^2} \right) = - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} $

So $ \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} = -2 \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} $

This is not zero! But this is wrong — energy is conserved in gravity.

What's the issue? Ah! I see — in the potential energy, for two bodies, it is $ U = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} $, not positive!

I forgot the sign!

In the original problem, the force is attractive:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So the potential energy should be:

$$
U_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Yes! In the beginning, I wrote:

> ""the total potential energy is:  
> $$ U = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} $$""

That's **wrong** — it should be **negative**!

Correct is:

$$
U = - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

So let's correct that.

Then for two bodies:

$$
U = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x}, \quad \frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{x^2} \dot{x}
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} + \frac{G m_1 m_2 \dot{x}}{x^2} = 0
$$

Perfect!

So in general, with the correct sign:

$$
U = - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

And earlier, we had:

$$
\sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_j - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} = 0
$$

Therefore, **total energy is conserved**:

$$
\boxed{E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}}
$$

## Final Answer: First Integrals of Motion

For the N-body gravitational system described, the following quantities are conserved:

1. **Total Linear Momentum**:
   $$
   \boxed{\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}}
   $$

2. **Total Angular Momentum**:
   $$
   \boxed{\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{constant}}
   $$

3. **Total Mechanical Energy**:
   $$
   \boxed{E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}}
   $$

These are the three fundamental first integrals of motion for the system.

✅ **Problem solved.**",0.714
9,"Try to prove that, for a celestial body in elliptical motion, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are respectively

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$","According to: 

Equation (i): For an elliptical orbit, when $f=0$ (periapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its minimum value: $r_{P}=\frac{p}{1+e}=a(1-e)$

Equation (ii): When $f=\pi$ (apoapsis), the radial distance $r$ takes its maximum value: $r_{A}=\frac{p}{1-e}=a(1+e)$

Conclude: 

It follows that the radial distances of the celestial body at periapsis and apoapsis are respectively

$r_{P}=a(1-e)$

$r_{A}=a(1+e)$

According to: 

From the vis-viva equation  $v=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}$

Conclude: 

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{P}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1-e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}$

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"We are to prove the expressions for the velocities at **aphelion** ($v_A$) and **perihelion** ($v_P$) for a celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit under the influence of gravity, given by:

$$
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

where:
- $\mu = GM$ is the standard gravitational parameter (with $G$ the gravitational constant and $M$ the mass of the central body),
- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit.

---

## Step 1: Understand the orbit geometry

In an elliptical orbit, the **perihelion** is the point closest to the central body, and **aphelion** is the farthest point. The distances from the focus (where the central body is located) to these points are:

- Perihelion distance: $r_P = a(1 - e)$
- Aphelion distance: $r_A = a(1 + e)$

This comes from the geometry of ellipses.

---

## Step 2: Use conservation of angular momentum

For a two-body problem under inverse-square gravity, **angular momentum is conserved**. So, if we denote the velocity at perihelion as $v_P$ and at aphelion as $v_A$, then:

$$
r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$

Why? Because angular momentum $L = m r v \sin\theta$, and at perihelion and aphelion, the velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector (i.e., $\theta = 90^\circ$), so $\sin\theta = 1$. Also, mass $m$ cancels out.

So,

$$
r_P v_P = r_A v_A \Rightarrow v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{r_P}{r_A}
$$

Substitute the expressions for $r_P$ and $r_A$:

$$
v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{a(1 - e)}{a(1 + e)} = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
$$

Thus,

$$
\boxed{v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} \tag{1}
$$

---

## Step 3: Use conservation of mechanical energy

The total mechanical energy $E$ of an object in orbit is conserved:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{\mu m}{r}
$$

Since energy is conserved, we can write:

$$
\frac{1}{2}mv_P^2 - \frac{\mu m}{r_P} = \frac{1}{2}mv_A^2 - \frac{\mu m}{r_A}
$$

Divide both sides by $m$:

$$
\frac{1}{2}v_P^2 - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = \frac{1}{2}v_A^2 - \frac{\mu}{r_A}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
v_P^2 - \frac{2\mu}{r_P} = v_A^2 - \frac{2\mu}{r_A}
$$

Rearrange:

$$
v_P^2 - v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{r_P} - \frac{2\mu}{r_A} = 2\mu \left( \frac{1}{r_P} - \frac{1}{r_A} \right)
$$

Now plug in $r_P = a(1 - e)$, $r_A = a(1 + e)$:

$$
v_P^2 - v_A^2 = 2\mu \left( \frac{1}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a(1 + e)} \right) = \frac{2\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1}{1 - e} - \frac{1}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Compute the expression in parentheses:

$$
\frac{1}{1 - e} - \frac{1}{1 + e} = \frac{(1 + e) - (1 - e)}{(1 - e)(1 + e)} = \frac{2e}{1 - e^2}
$$

So,

$$
v_P^2 - v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{2e}{1 - e^2} = \frac{4\mu e}{a(1 - e^2)} \tag{2}
$$

---

## Step 4: Use equation (1) to express $v_A$ in terms of $v_P$

From equation (1):

$$
v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
\Rightarrow v_A^2 = v_P^2 \cdot \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^2
$$

Plug into equation (2):

$$
v_P^2 - v_P^2 \cdot \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^2 = \frac{4\mu e}{a(1 - e^2)}
$$

Factor out $v_P^2$:

$$
v_P^2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^2 \right] = \frac{4\mu e}{a(1 - e^2)}
$$

Compute the term in brackets:

Let’s compute:

$$
1 - \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^2 = \frac{(1 + e)^2 - (1 - e)^2}{(1 + e)^2}
$$

Numerator:

$$
(1 + e)^2 - (1 - e)^2 = [1 + 2e + e^2] - [1 - 2e + e^2] = 4e
$$

Denominator:

$$
(1 + e)^2
$$

So,

$$
1 - \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^2 = \frac{4e}{(1 + e)^2}
$$

Therefore:

$$
v_P^2 \cdot \frac{4e}{(1 + e)^2} = \frac{4\mu e}{a(1 - e^2)}
$$

Cancel $4e$ from both sides (assuming $e \neq 0$):

$$
v_P^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(1 + e)^2} = \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e^2)}
$$

Note that $1 - e^2 = (1 - e)(1 + e)$, so:

$$
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e^2)} \cdot (1 + e)^2 = \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e)(1 + e)} \cdot (1 + e)^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{(1 + e)^2}{(1 - e)(1 + e)} = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

Thus,

$$
\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }}
$$

---

## Step 5: Find $v_A$ using relation (1)

Recall from equation (1):

$$
v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
$$

Substitute $v_P$:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
$$

Simplify:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

Because:

$$
\sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - e)^2}{(1 + e)^2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \cdot \frac{(1 - e)^2}{(1 + e)^2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

Alternatively, just note:

$$
\frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^1 = \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)^{1/2} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

But more simply:

$$
v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
= \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

Hence,

$$
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }}
$$

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

We have proven that:

$$
\boxed{v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}}, \quad \boxed{v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}}
$$

10,"Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

$P=\frac{d}{R}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G\rho}}$",No,"We are given a **very long cylindrical planet** of **average density ρ** and **radius R**, with a satellite orbiting at distance **d** from its center. We are to find the relationship between the **orbital period P** and the **distance d**.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Geometry

The planet is described as **very long cylindrical** — meaning its length is much greater than its radius, so we can treat it as an **infinite cylinder** for gravitational purposes. This is important because the gravitational field of an infinite uniform cylinder differs from that of a sphere.

In such a case, **Gauss’s Law for gravity** can be applied using a Gaussian surface (a coaxial cylinder) to find the gravitational field.

---

## Step 2: Apply Gauss’s Law for Gravity

Gauss’s Law for gravity states:

\[
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]

For a cylindrical symmetry, we choose a Gaussian surface as a **cylinder of radius d and length L**, coaxial with the planet.

The gravitational field will be radial and perpendicular to the axis, and constant in magnitude on the curved surface.

So,

\[
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
\]

Thus,

\[
g = -\frac{2G M_{\text{enc}}}{d L}
\]

Now, compute \( M_{\text{enc}} \): mass enclosed within radius d.

But note: if the satellite orbits **outside** the planet (d > R), then the enclosed mass is the entire mass per unit length of the cylinder.

If the satellite orbits **inside** the planet (d < R), then only the mass within radius d contributes.

So we need to consider both cases.

---

## Step 3: Compute Enclosed Mass per Unit Length

Let the linear mass density (mass per unit length) of the cylinder be \( \mu \).

Since the cylinder has radius R and average density ρ, the mass per unit length is:

\[
\mu = \rho \cdot \text{cross-sectional area} = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
\]

So,

- If \( d > R \): \( M_{\text{enc}} = \mu L = \rho \pi R^2 L \)
- If \( d < R \): \( M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot \pi d^2 L \)

---

## Step 4: Find Gravitational Field g(d)

Using Gauss’s Law:

### Case 1: Satellite outside the planet (d ≥ R)

\[
g(d) = -\frac{2G (\rho \pi R^2 L)}{d L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\]

So, magnitude:

\[
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\]

### Case 2: Satellite inside the planet (d ≤ R)

\[
g(d) = -\frac{2G (\rho \pi d^2 L)}{d L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho d}{1}
\]

So, magnitude:

\[
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho d
\]

---

## Step 5: Relate Gravitational Force to Centripetal Force

For circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:

\[
\frac{m v^2}{d} = m g(d)
\Rightarrow \frac{v^2}{d} = g(d)
\]

Also, orbital speed \( v = \frac{2\pi d}{P} \), so:

\[
\frac{(2\pi d / P)^2}{d} = g(d)
\Rightarrow \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2 d} = g(d)
\Rightarrow \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2} = g(d)
\]

Therefore,

\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{g(d)}
\]

---

## Step 6: Plug in g(d) for Both Cases

### Case 1: d ≥ R

\[
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
\Rightarrow P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}} = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
\]

So,

\[
P = \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2} } = d \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} }
\]

This shows that **for d ≥ R, P ∝ d** — unlike Kepler’s third law for spheres (where P² ∝ d³).

### Case 2: d ≤ R

\[
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho d
\Rightarrow P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{2\pi G \rho d} = \frac{2\pi}{G \rho}
\]

So,

\[
P = \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho} }
\]

This is **independent of d**! All satellites orbiting inside the planet have the **same period**, regardless of their distance from the axis — similar to how a harmonic oscillator behaves.

---

## Final Answer

The expression relating the period \( P \) to distance \( d \) depends on whether the satellite is inside or outside the planet:

\[
\boxed{
P =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{\dfrac{2\pi}{G \rho}} & \text{if } d \leq R \\
d \sqrt{\dfrac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}} & \text{if } d \geq R
\end{cases}
}
\]

---

## Interpretation

- Inside the cylinder (d ≤ R): The period is **constant**, independent of d — like a “gravity well” where all orbits take the same time.
- Outside the cylinder (d ≥ R): The period increases linearly with d — which contrasts sharply with spherical planets, where P ∝ d^{3/2}.

This result arises due to the **cylindrical symmetry** and the resulting **1/d dependence** of gravity outside, and **linear dependence** inside.",0.637
11,"Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v.

- Galaxy A is a **spiral galaxy**, and at distance R from its center, its **rotational velocity** is v.
- Galaxy B is a **spherical elliptical galaxy**, composed of **uniformly distributed stars**, and its **radial velocity dispersion** at distance R is also v.

We are to calculate the **masses** of both galaxies.

---

## Step 1: Mass of Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)

In spiral galaxies, we often use **rotation curves** to estimate mass via **Keplerian dynamics** or more generally, **Newtonian gravity** assuming circular orbits.

At radius R, the rotational velocity v is related to the enclosed mass M_A by:

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M_A}{R}
\]

This comes from setting centripetal force equal to gravitational force for a star in circular orbit:

\[
\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M_A}{R^2} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M_A}{R}
\]

Solving for M_A:

\[
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ So, **Mass of Galaxy A = \( \frac{v^2 R}{G} \)**

---

## Step 2: Mass of Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)

Galaxy B is spherical and composed of uniformly spaced stars — implying a **spherically symmetric mass distribution**.

We’re told the **radial velocity dispersion** at distance R is v. In stellar dynamics, for a **spherical system** in equilibrium, we use the **virial theorem** or **Jeans equation** to relate velocity dispersion to mass.

However, for a **spherical system with isotropic velocity dispersion** (which is often assumed unless otherwise specified), the **gravitational potential** at radius R is related to the velocity dispersion σ by:

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{G M_B}{5R} \quad \text{(for uniform density sphere)}
\]

Wait — let’s be precise.

Actually, for a **uniform density sphere** (constant ρ inside radius R), the gravitational potential at radius r is:

\[
\Phi(r) = -\frac{3 G M}{2 R} \cdot \frac{r^2}{R^2} \quad \text{for } r < R
\]

But for velocity dispersion, we need to use the **Jeans equation** or **virial theorem**.

Alternatively, for an **isotropic, spherically symmetric system**, the **velocity dispersion** σ satisfies:

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{3} \frac{d\Phi}{dr} \cdot \frac{r}{\rho} \quad \text{(from Jeans equation)}
\]

But perhaps a simpler approach: For a **uniform density sphere**, the **gravitational acceleration** at radius r is:

\[
g(r) = \frac{G M_{\text{enc}}(r)}{r^2}
\]

For a uniform sphere, M_enc(r) = M_B × (r/R)^3, so:

\[
g(r) = \frac{G M_B}{R^2} \cdot \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)
\]

But we are told that the **radial velocity dispersion** at radius R is v.

In equilibrium, for a **spherical system**, the **velocity dispersion** σ_r at radius r is related to the gravitational potential by the **Jeans equation**. But if we assume **isotropic velocity dispersion** and **hydrostatic equilibrium**, then:

\[
\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{dP}{dr} = - \frac{d\Phi}{dr}
\]

where P is pressure, which for stars can be written as P = ρ σ².

So:

\[
\frac{d}{dr} (\rho \sigma^2) = - \rho \frac{d\Phi}{dr}
\]

Assuming σ is constant (isotropic and homogeneous), then:

\[
\rho \sigma^2 = - \rho \frac{d\Phi}{dr} \Rightarrow \sigma^2 = - \frac{d\Phi}{dr}
\]

Wait — this is not quite right because it assumes σ² is constant, but actually, for a uniform sphere, σ² may vary with r.

Alternatively, consider the **virial theorem** for a self-gravitating system.

The virial theorem says:

\[
2K + W = 0
\]

where K is kinetic energy and W is gravitational potential energy.

For a system of particles, the average kinetic energy per particle is:

\[
\langle K \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} m (3 \sigma^2)
\]

if velocity dispersion is isotropic.

Total kinetic energy:

\[
K = \frac{3}{2} \sigma^2 M_B
\]

Gravitational potential energy for a uniform sphere:

\[
W = - \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Then virial theorem:

\[
2K + W = 0 \Rightarrow 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \sigma^2 M_B - \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R} = 0
\]

Wait — signs! Actually, W is negative, so:

\[
2K + W = 0 \Rightarrow 2K = -W
\]

So:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \sigma^2 M_B = \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Cancel 3 on both sides:

\[
2 \sigma^2 M_B = \frac{G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Divide both sides by M_B (assuming M_B ≠ 0):

\[
2 \sigma^2 = \frac{G M_B}{5 R}
\]

Therefore:

\[
M_B = \frac{10 \sigma^2 R}{G}
\]

But in our problem, the **radial velocity dispersion** is given as v. If we assume **isotropic velocity dispersion**, then σ_r = σ = v.

So:

\[
M_B = \frac{10 v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ So, **Mass of Galaxy B = \( \frac{10 v^2 R}{G} \)**

---

## Final Answer:

- **Mass of Galaxy A (spiral):** \( \boxed{\dfrac{v^2 R}{G}} \)
- **Mass of Galaxy B (elliptical, uniform):** \( \boxed{\dfrac{10 v^2 R}{G}} \)

---

## Interpretation:

Galaxy B has **10 times** the mass of Galaxy A, even though they have the same radius and the same value v (rotational velocity for A, velocity dispersion for B). This makes sense because:

- In spiral galaxies, rotation velocity is dominated by **circular motion** — the mass is inferred from Kepler’s law.
- In elliptical galaxies, stars move in random orbits, and **velocity dispersion** reflects the depth of the gravitational potential well. For a uniform sphere, the virial theorem gives a larger mass for the same velocity dispersion compared to the Keplerian case.

This also illustrates why ellipticals appear “more massive” than spirals of similar size when comparing velocity dispersion vs. rotation velocity — due to different dynamical assumptions and distributions.

12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"We are given that in a white dwarf, the electron degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational pressure. We are to find the **density** of the white dwarf as a function of its total mass $M$, atomic number $Z$, mass number $A$, and fundamental constants.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

- The star is composed of nuclei (with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$) and electrons.
- Each nucleus has $Z$ electrons associated with it (since atoms are neutral).
- Therefore, the number of electrons per nucleus is $Z$.
- The total number of electrons in the star is $N_e = Z \cdot N_{\text{nuclei}}$, where $N_{\text{nuclei}}$ is the number of nuclei.
- The total mass of the star is approximately $M = A \cdot m_p \cdot N_{\text{nuclei}}$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass (approximately equal to the nucleon mass).

So we can write:

$$
N_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{M}{A m_p}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
N_e = Z \cdot \frac{M}{A m_p}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find electron number density $n$

Number density $n$ is number of electrons per unit volume:

$$
n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p V}
$$

We will use this expression later.

---

### Step 3: Equate pressures

The problem states that electron degeneracy pressure balances gravitational pressure:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}|
$$

Note: $p_{\text{grav}}$ is negative (inward), so we take its magnitude.

Given:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
$$

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
|p_{\text{grav}}| = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3GM^2}{5R} = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}
$$

So equating:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{VR}
$$

---

### Step 4: Express everything in terms of density $\rho$

We want to find the **density** $\rho = \frac{M}{V}$.

Also, recall that for a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$, so $R = \left( \frac{3V}{4\pi} \right)^{1/3}$

But perhaps better to express $R$ in terms of $V$ or vice versa.

From $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$, we get $R = \left( \frac{3V}{4\pi} \right)^{1/3}$, so:

$$
\frac{1}{R} = \left( \frac{4\pi}{3V} \right)^{1/3}
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{1}{VR} = \frac{1}{V} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3V} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{GM^2}{VR} = GM^2 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

Now plug into the equation:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = GM^2 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

Recall from earlier:

$$
n = \frac{Z M}{A m_p V}
$$

So,

$$
n^{5/3} = \left( \frac{Z M}{A m_p V} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Substitute into left-hand side:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z M}{A m_p V} \right)^{5/3} = GM^2 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for $V$ in terms of $M$, then find $\rho = M/V$

Let’s collect all terms on one side.

Divide both sides by $M^2$:

Left-hand side:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} V^{-5/3}
$$

Right-hand side:

$$
G \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} V^{-5/3} = G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{-4/3}
$$

Multiply both sides by $V^{5/3}$:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} = G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} V^{1/3}
$$

Now solve for $V^{1/3}$:

$$
V^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} }{ G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} }
$$

Raise both sides to the power 3:

$$
V = \left[ \frac{ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} }{ G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} } \right]^3
$$

Now, density $\rho = M / V$, so:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{1}{M^2} \cdot \left[ \frac{ G \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{1/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} } \right]^3
$$

Wait — let's be careful. From above:

$$
V = \left[ \text{constant} \cdot M^{5/3} \right]^3 = \text{constant} \cdot M^5
$$

So:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{ \text{const} \cdot M^5 } = \frac{1}{ \text{const} \cdot M^4 }
$$

Therefore, density is **inversely proportional to $M^4$**.

But let's write it explicitly.

From:

$$
V^{1/3} = \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \cdot \frac{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} }{ G } \cdot \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{-1/3} \cdot M^{5/3}
$$

So:

$$
V = \left[ \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \cdot \frac{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} }{ G } \cdot \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{-1/3} \cdot M^{5/3} \right]^3
$$

$$
V = \left( \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \right)^3 \cdot \frac{ (3\pi^2)^2 }{ G^3 } \cdot \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^5 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{-1} \cdot M^5
$$

Therefore:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{1}{ \left( \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \right)^3 \cdot \frac{ (3\pi^2)^2 }{ G^3 } \cdot \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^5 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{-1} \cdot M^4 }
$$

Simplify:

$$
\rho = \frac{1}{ \left( \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \right)^3 } \cdot \frac{ G^3 }{ (3\pi^2)^2 } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{M^4}
$$

So finally:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{ G^3 }{ \left( \frac{ \hbar^2 }{ m_e } \right)^3 (3\pi^2)^2 } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{M^4}
}
$$

Or, rearranged more neatly:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4\pi G^3}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot \frac{1}{M^4}
}
$$

This is the **density of the white dwarf** as a function of its total mass $M$, atomic number $Z$, mass number $A$, and fundamental constants.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4\pi G^3}{3 (3\pi^2)^2} \left( \frac{m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \frac{1}{M^4}
}
$$

This formula shows that the density of a white dwarf decreases as the fourth power of its mass — meaning **more massive white dwarfs are less dense**, which is counterintuitive but correct due to the nature of degenerate matter.",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

The interaction energy between the pair of magnetic dipoles is equal to the potential energy of one of the dipoles due to the other dipole's magnetic field.

$$

and the potential energy of a magnetic dipole $\vec{m}_2$ in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is:

$$
U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}
$$

We want to compute the **interaction energy** $U_{\text{int}}$ between two magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1$ and $\vec{m}_2$ separated by vector $\vec{r}$.

---

### Step 1: Substitute $\vec{B}$ from dipole 1 into the energy formula for dipole 2

The magnetic field at the location of $\vec{m}_2$ due to $\vec{m}_1$ is:

$$
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
$$

Then the interaction energy is:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

Factor out constants:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Now distribute the dot product:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

So we arrive at the final expression:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
$$

---

### Interpretation:

This is the standard expression for the **dipole-dipole interaction energy** in classical electromagnetism. The term $\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2$ represents the direct alignment energy, while the second term accounts for the angular dependence due to the orientation relative to the separation vector $\vec{r}$. The factor of 3 arises because the field of a dipole is not isotropic — it has a directional dependence (quadrupole-like structure).

---

### Note on Physical Context:

In the case of hydrogen’s hyperfine splitting, this interaction occurs between the electron and proton magnetic moments. Since the electron and proton are quantum mechanical spin-1/2 particles, their spins can be aligned or anti-aligned. The energy difference between these states leads to the emission of a 21 cm photon when the atom transitions from the higher-energy parallel-spin state to the lower-energy anti-parallel state.

But for this question, we were only asked to derive the classical dipole-dipole interaction energy, which we have done.

2. The **orbital angular momentum** of the electron.

We assume classical mechanics (not quantum mechanics), and ignore relativistic effects.

## Step 1: Understand the physical setup

- The electron orbits the proton in a circular path of radius $ r $.
- The only force acting is the electrostatic (Coulomb) force between the electron and proton:
  $$
  F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}

  (since both charges have magnitude $ e $, and opposite signs — but force magnitude is positive).

- Since $ m_p \gg m_e $, we can treat the proton as fixed at the center (i.e., we neglect its motion). This simplifies the problem to a single particle orbiting a fixed center.

K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_e \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} \right) = \frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

### Potential Energy:

In electrostatics, the potential energy between two point charges is:

$$
U = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

(Note: negative because it's attractive.)

### Total Energy:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} - \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

✅ So, the **total energy** is:

$$
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}}
$$

## Step 4: Compute orbital angular momentum

Angular momentum $ L $ for circular motion is:

$$
L = m_e v r
$$

We already have $ v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} $, so:

$$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
$$

Thus,

$$
L = m_e \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} } \cdot r = m_e \cdot r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r} }
$$

Simplify:

$$
L = \sqrt{ m_e^2 \cdot r^2 \cdot \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 m_e r} } = \sqrt{ m_e \cdot r \cdot \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

So,

$$
L = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

✅ Therefore, the **orbital angular momentum** is:

$$
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }}
$$

## Final Answers:

- **Total Energy**: $ \boxed{E = -\dfrac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \dfrac{e^2}{r}} $

These expressions are valid under classical mechanics, assuming circular orbit and fixed proton due to $ m_p \gg m_e $.",0.637

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude:

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"We are told that a meteorite (mass $ m_1 $) is approaching Earth **radially** and collides with a space station (mass $ m_2 $) orbiting Earth in a **circular orbit of radius R**. After the collision, the two form a conglomerate of mass $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, which moves in a **closed orbit** whose **minimum distance from Earth’s center is R/2**.

We are to find:

(i) The speed of the meteorite just before collision  
(ii) The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate  
(iii) The maximum distance of the conglomerate from Earth  
(iv) The condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ for this scenario to be possible

---

## Step 1: Understand the setup

Before collision:

- Space station: circular orbit at radius R → its orbital speed is $ v_{\text{orb}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
- Meteorite: moving radially inward toward Earth → we don’t yet know its speed, call it $ v_0 $. Since it’s radial, its angular momentum about Earth’s center is zero.

After collision:

- The conglomerate has total mass $ m = m_1 + m_2 $
- It moves in a **closed orbit** with **perigee (closest approach) at R/2**
- Since the orbit is closed and perigee is R/2 < R, the orbit must be **elliptical** (since circular orbit would have constant radius).

Thus, **shape of orbit**: **Ellipse**

---

## Step 2: Conservation laws

We assume the collision is **inelastic**, so kinetic energy is not conserved, but **linear momentum and angular momentum are conserved**.

But since the meteorite is moving radially and the space station is moving tangentially, their velocities are perpendicular. However, after collision, they stick together — so we need to compute the velocity vector of the conglomerate immediately after collision.

Let’s define:

- Before collision:
    - Space station: position vector magnitude R, velocity vector tangential: $ \vec{v}_2 = v_2 \hat{\theta} $, where $ v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
    - Meteorite: position vector magnitude R (same point), velocity vector radial inward: $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_0 \hat{r} $

After collision, the conglomerate has velocity $ \vec{v} = \vec{v}_{\text{cm}} $, given by conservation of linear momentum:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) \vec{v} = m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2
$$

So,

$$
\vec{v} = \frac{m_1 (-v_0 \hat{r}) + m_2 (v_2 \hat{\theta})}{m_1 + m_2}
= -\frac{m_1 v_0}{m_1 + m_2} \hat{r} + \frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} \hat{\theta}
$$

So, immediately after collision, the conglomerate has both radial and tangential components of velocity.

This will determine the shape and parameters of the elliptical orbit.

---

## Step 3: Use conservation of angular momentum and energy for the orbit

The orbit of the conglomerate is an ellipse with perigee at $ r_{\min} = R/2 $. We can use conservation of angular momentum and mechanical energy to find the required initial conditions.

### Angular Momentum

At the point of collision (which is at radius R), the angular momentum per unit mass of the conglomerate is:

$$
L = r \times v_{\perp} = R \cdot v_{\theta} = R \cdot \frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

Note: The radial component does not contribute to angular momentum.

So,

$$
L = \frac{m_2 R v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

But since we’re dealing with orbits, it’s often easier to work with specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass):

$$
\ell = \frac{L}{m} = \frac{m_2 R v_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}
$$

Wait — actually, let's clarify:

Angular momentum of the system is:

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} = R \cdot (m_2 v_2) \quad \text{(since only tangential component contributes)}
$$

So total angular momentum: $ L = R m_2 v_2 $

Then specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass): $ \ell = \frac{L}{m} = \frac{R m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} $

Yes, correct.

---

### Energy

Total mechanical energy of the conglomerate after collision:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

where $ v^2 = v_r^2 + v_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_0}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 $

So,

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} m \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_0}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_2}{m} \right)^2 \right] - \frac{G M m}{R}
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2}{m} + \frac{m_2^2 v_2^2}{m} \right] - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

Simplify:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2 + m_2^2 v_2^2}{m} \right) - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

## Step 4: Properties of elliptical orbit

For an elliptical orbit around Earth, we know:

- Perigee: $ r_p = R/2 $
- Apogee: $ r_a = ? $ (to find)
- Semi-major axis: $ a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} $
- Specific angular momentum: $ \ell = \sqrt{G M p} $, where $ p = a(1 - e^2) $ is the semi-latus rectum
- Also, $ \ell = r_p v_p $, where $ v_p $ is speed at perigee

Also, energy:

$$
E = -\frac{G M m}{2a}
$$

So, if we can express E and ℓ in terms of known quantities, we can relate them to the orbit parameters.

But we also know that at the point of collision (radius R), the conglomerate is not necessarily at apogee or perigee — unless we assume that the collision occurs at apogee or perigee. But wait — the problem says that the **minimum distance** is R/2. So if the collision happens at radius R, then unless R is the apogee, the orbit will have perigee at R/2 and apogee > R.

But here’s the key: **the collision occurs at radius R, and the orbit has perigee at R/2. So R must be the apogee!**

Why? Because the orbit is closed and has minimum distance R/2. If the collision happened at R, and R > R/2, then unless R is the farthest point (apogee), the orbit would have a point farther than R, contradicting that R is the collision radius. But the problem doesn't say that R is the maximum distance — it only says that the **minimum** distance is R/2. So R could be anywhere between R/2 and r_a.

Actually, no — the collision occurs at radius R, and the orbit has perigee at R/2. So R is **not** necessarily the apogee — it could be somewhere else on the ellipse. But then we cannot directly relate angular momentum and energy without knowing where on the orbit the collision occurred.

Wait — here's the crucial point: **the collision occurs at radius R, and the orbit has perigee at R/2. Therefore, R must be greater than R/2, and since the orbit is elliptical, there is a unique point at radius R on the orbit. But unless we know whether that point is apogee or not, we cannot proceed easily.**

However, note: **in an elliptical orbit, the angular momentum is constant, and the speed varies. At perigee, speed is maximum; at apogee, speed is minimum.**

But here, the collision occurs at radius R. For the orbit to have perigee at R/2, and collision at R, we must have that **R is the apogee** — because if R were not the apogee, then there would be some point farther away than R, but the problem doesn’t mention any such point. Moreover, if the collision occurred at R, and the orbit has perigee at R/2, then unless R is the apogee, the orbit would extend beyond R — but the problem doesn’t say that, and we are to find the maximum distance later — so perhaps R is not necessarily the apogee.

Actually, re-read: “after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2.”

It doesn’t say anything about the maximum distance. So R may or may not be the apogee.

But here’s the key: **at the point of collision (radius R), we know the velocity vector (from conservation of momentum). From that, we can compute angular momentum and energy, and then use those to determine the orbit parameters.**

So we proceed as follows:

---

## Step 5: Compute angular momentum and energy immediately after collision

As above:

Specific angular momentum:

$$
\ell = \frac{R m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

with $ v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $, so

$$
\ell = \frac{R m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
$$

Total energy:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} m \left( v_r^2 + v_\theta^2 \right) - \frac{G M m}{R}
= \frac{1}{2} m \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_0}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2 v_2}{m} \right)^2 \right] - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2 + m_2^2 v_2^2}{m} \right) - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

Substitute $ v_2^2 = \frac{GM}{R} $:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2 + m_2^2 \cdot \frac{GM}{R}}{m} \right) - \frac{G M m}{R}
= \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2}{2m} + \frac{m_2^2 G M}{2m R} - \frac{G M m}{R}
$$

Factor out $ \frac{G M}{R} $:

$$
E = \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2}{2m} + \frac{G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2m} - m \right)
$$

---

## Step 6: Relate to elliptical orbit

For an elliptical orbit, the energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M m}{2a}
$$

And specific angular momentum:

$$
\ell = \sqrt{G M p} = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}
$$

Also, at perigee $ r_p = a(1 - e) $, and at apogee $ r_a = a(1 + e) $

We are told that the **minimum distance** is $ r_p = R/2 $

So,

$$
r_p = a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2}
\Rightarrow a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \tag{1}
$$

Also, we know:

$$
\ell = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)} \tag{2}
$$

From earlier, we have expression for $ \ell $:

$$
\ell = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R}
$$

So square both sides:

$$
\ell^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R
$$

Set equal to RHS of (2):

$$
G M a (1 - e^2) = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R
$$

Cancel $ G M $:

$$
a (1 - e^2) = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R \tag{3}
$$

Now, from equation (1): $ a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} $

Let’s solve equations (1) and (3) together.

From (1): $ a = \frac{R}{2(1 - e)} $

Plug into (3):

$$
\frac{R}{2(1 - e)} (1 - e^2) = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R
$$

Cancel R (assuming R ≠ 0):

$$
\frac{1 - e^2}{2(1 - e)} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
$$

Note: $ 1 - e^2 = (1 - e)(1 + e) $, so

$$
\frac{(1 - e)(1 + e)}{2(1 - e)} = \frac{1 + e}{2} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
$$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{1 + e}{2} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \tag{4}
$$

This gives us eccentricity e in terms of masses.

Now, we can find the apogee distance:

From (1): $ a(1 - e) = R/2 $

From (4): $ 1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 $

Add equations (1) and (4)? Better to solve for a.

From (4):

$$
e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1
$$

Then,

$$
a = \frac{R}{2(1 - e)} = \frac{R}{2 \left[1 - \left(2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1 \right) \right]} = \frac{R}{2 \left[2 - 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right]} = \frac{R}{4 \left[1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right]}
$$

Let’s denote $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $, so $ 0 < \mu < 1 $

Then,

$$
e = 2 \mu^2 - 1 \\
a = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)}
$$

Apogee distance:

$$
r_a = a(1 + e) = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} \cdot (1 + 2\mu^2 - 1) = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} \cdot 2\mu^2 = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)}
$$

So maximum distance is $ r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} $, where $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $

We’ll come back to this.

---

## Step 7: Find speed of meteorite before collision (Part i)

We need to find $ v_0 $, the speed of the meteorite before collision.

Recall that we have expressions for energy E in terms of $ v_0 $, and also E = -GMm/(2a)

So set them equal.

From earlier:

Energy:

$$
E = \frac{m_1^2 v_0^2}{2m} + \frac{G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2m} - m \right)
$$

Also,

$$
E = -\frac{G M m}{2a}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_0^2}{2m} + \frac{G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2m} - m \right) = -\frac{G M m}{2a}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2m:

$$
m_1^2 v_0^2 + \frac{2 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2} - m^2 \right) = -\frac{G M m^2}{a}
$$

Simplify:

$$
m_1^2 v_0^2 + \frac{G M}{R} (m_2^2 - 2 m^2) = -\frac{G M m^2}{a}
$$

Bring all terms to left:

$$
m_1^2 v_0^2 = -\frac{G M m^2}{a} - \frac{G M}{R} (m_2^2 - 2 m^2)
= -G M \left[ \frac{m^2}{a} + \frac{m_2^2}{R} - \frac{2 m^2}{R} \right]
= -G M \left[ \frac{m^2}{a} + \frac{m_2^2 - 2 m^2}{R} \right]
$$

Now plug in $ a = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} $, and $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m} $

So,

$$
\frac{m^2}{a} = m^2 \cdot \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} = \frac{4 m^2 (1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Also, $ m_2^2 - 2 m^2 = m^2 (\mu^2 - 2) $

So,

$$
m_1^2 v_0^2 = -G M \left[ \frac{4 m^2 (1 - \mu^2)}{R} + \frac{m^2 (\mu^2 - 2)}{R} \right]
= -\frac{G M m^2}{R} \left[ 4(1 - \mu^2) + (\mu^2 - 2) \right]
$$

Simplify inside:

$$
4 - 4\mu^2 + \mu^2 - 2 = 2 - 3\mu^2
$$

So,

$$
m_1^2 v_0^2 = -\frac{G M m^2}{R} (2 - 3\mu^2)
$$

But the left side is positive (square of speed), so right side must be positive ⇒

$$
-(2 - 3\mu^2) > 0 \Rightarrow 3\mu^2 > 2 \Rightarrow \mu^2 > \frac{2}{3}
$$

Which is a condition we'll address later.

But assuming that holds, then:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

But $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m} $, so $ \mu^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} $, so:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} \left(3 \frac{m_2^2}{m^2} - 2 \right) = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \left( \frac{3 m_2^2}{m_1^2} - 2 \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} \right)
$$

Since $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, $ \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} = \left(1 + \frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 $

Alternatively, write:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \left( 3 \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 - 2 \left(1 + \frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 \right)
$$

Let’s simplify:

Let $ x = \frac{m_2}{m_1} $, then:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \left( 3x^2 - 2(1 + 2x + x^2) \right) = \frac{G M}{R} (3x^2 - 2 - 4x - 2x^2) = \frac{G M}{R} (x^2 - 4x - 2)
$$

Wait — that gives negative for small x, but we need it to be positive.

But earlier we had:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} (3\mu^2 - 2) = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 \left(3 \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 - 2\right)
$$

This is messy. Let’s keep in terms of μ.

Recall:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m^2}{m_1^2} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

But $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m} $, so $ m_2 = \mu m $, so $ m_1 = m - m_2 = m(1 - \mu) $

So,

$$
\frac{m^2}{m_1^2} = \frac{m^2}{m^2 (1 - \mu)^2} = \frac{1}{(1 - \mu)^2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - \mu)^2} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

So,

$$
v_0 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3\mu^2 - 2}{(1 - \mu)^2} }
$$

This is the answer for part (i).

But remember, this requires $ 3\mu^2 - 2 > 0 $, i.e., $ \mu > \sqrt{2/3} $, which we’ll discuss in part (iv).

---

## Step 8: Minimum and maximum speeds of conglomerate (Part ii)

In an elliptical orbit, the speed is maximum at perigee and minimum at apogee.

Perigee: $ r_p = R/2 $

Apogee: $ r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} $, as found earlier.

Speed at perigee: $ v_p = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{r_p} \left( \frac{2 r_a}{r_p + r_a} - 1 \right) } $

Standard formula for speed at distance r in elliptical orbit:

$$
v = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right) }
$$

So,

At perigee $ r_p = R/2 $:

$$
v_p = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) } = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right) }
$$

At apogee $ r_a $:

$$
v_a = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{2}{r_a} - \frac{1}{a} \right) }
$$

We already have $ a = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} $

So,

$$
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Thus,

$$
v_p = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} \right) } = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot 4 \mu^2 } = 2 \mu \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Similarly,

$$
v_a = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{2}{r_a} - \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} \right) }
$$

But $ r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} $, so $ \frac{2}{r_a} = \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R \mu^2} $

Thus,

$$
v_a = \sqrt{ G M \left( \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R \mu^2} - \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} \right) } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 G M (1 - \mu^2)}{R} \left( \frac{1}{\mu^2} - 1 \right) } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 G M (1 - \mu^2)}{R} \cdot \frac{1 - \mu^2}{\mu^2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 G M (1 - \mu^2)^2}{R \mu^2} }
$$

$$
v_a = \frac{2 (1 - \mu) \sqrt{G M}}{\mu \sqrt{R}} = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

So,

Minimum speed: $ v_a = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

Maximum speed: $ v_p = 2 \mu \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

(Note: since $ \mu > \sqrt{2/3} > 0.8 $, and $ \mu < 1 $, so $ v_p > v_a $, as expected.)

---

## Step 9: Maximum distance (Part iii)

We already found:

$$
r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)}
$$

With $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $

---

## Step 10: Condition on m1 and m2 (Part iv)

From earlier, for $ v_0^2 > 0 $, we need:

$$
3\mu^2 - 2 > 0 \Rightarrow \mu^2 > \frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 > \frac{2}{3}
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} > \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\Rightarrow m_2 > \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} (m_1 + m_2)
\Rightarrow m_2 \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \right) > \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} m_1
\Rightarrow m_2 > \frac{ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} }{1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}} m_1
$$

Compute numerical value:

$ \sqrt{2/3} \approx \sqrt{0.6667} \approx 0.8165 $

So,

$$
m_2 > \frac{0.8165}{1 - 0.8165} m_1 \approx \frac{0.8165}{0.1835} m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1
$$

So, approximately, $ m_2 > 4.45 m_1 $

Exactly:

$$
\frac{ \sqrt{2/3} }{1 - \sqrt{2/3}} = \frac{ \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{3} }{1 - \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{3}} = \frac{ \sqrt{2} }{ \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2} }
$$

Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by $ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} $:

$$
\frac{ \sqrt{2} (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}) }{ (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}) } = \frac{ \sqrt{6} + 2 }{ 3 - 2 } = \sqrt{6} + 2
$$

So,

$$
m_2 > (\sqrt{6} + 2) m_1
$$

Therefore, the condition is:

$$
\boxed{ m_2 > (\sqrt{6} + 2) m_1 }
$$

## Final Answers

**(i) Speed of meteorite just before collision:**

$$
v_0 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3\mu^2 - 2}{(1 - \mu)^2} } \quad \text{where} \quad \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

Or, equivalently:

$$
\boxed{ v_0 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1)^2} } }
$$

Wait — let me check:

From earlier:

$$
v_0^2 = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - \mu)^2} (3\mu^2 - 2) = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m} \right)^2 - 2}{ \left(1 - \frac{m_2}{m}\right)^2 } = \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2 m^2}{m_1^2}
$$

Since $ m = m_1 + m_2 $, yes.

So,

$$
\boxed{ v_0 = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} \cdot \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1^2} } }
$$

**(ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of conglomerate:**

Maximum speed (at perigee): $ v_p = 2 \mu \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

Minimum speed (at apogee): $ v_a = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

So,

$$
\boxed{ v_{\max} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } }, \quad
\boxed{ v_{\min} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } }
$$

Wait — check:

Earlier: $ v_p = 2 \mu \sqrt{GM/R} = 2 \frac{m_2}{m} \sqrt{GM/R} $

$ v_a = 2 \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \sqrt{GM/R} = 2 \frac{m_1}{m_2} \sqrt{GM/R} $

But that seems inconsistent with units — no, it’s fine.

But note: $ \frac{m_1}{m_2} $ is dimensionless, so ok.

But let’s write clearly:

Maximum speed: $ \boxed{ v_{\max} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } } $

Minimum speed: $ \boxed{ v_{\min} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } } $? No!

Wait — mistake.

Earlier:

$ v_a = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } = 2 \left( \frac{m_1 / m}{m_2 / m} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } = 2 \frac{m_1}{m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } $

But is that correct? Let’s verify with energy.

At apogee, speed should be less than at perigee.

If $ m_2 > m_1 $, then $ \mu > 0.5 $, so $ v_p = 2\mu \sqrt{...} > \sqrt{...} $, and $ v_a = 2 \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \sqrt{...} $, which for $ \mu > 0.5 $, $ \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} < 1 $, so $ v_a < v_p $, good.

But is $ v_a = 2 \frac{m_1}{m_2} \sqrt{GM/R} $? Only if $ \mu = m_2/m $, so $ 1 - \mu = m_1/m $, so $ \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} = \frac{m_1}{m_2} $, yes.

So,

$$
\boxed{ v_{\min} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } }
$$

Wait — but that depends on m2 in denominator, which is unusual. But mathematically correct.

Alternatively, we can write:

$$
v_{\min} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{\mu} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } = 2 \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Same thing.

But perhaps better to write in terms of μ:

$$
\boxed{ v_{\max} = 2 \mu \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } }, \quad \boxed{ v_{\min} = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \mu}{\mu} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} } }
$$

with $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $

**(iii) Maximum distance:**

$$
\boxed{ r_{\max} = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} } = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2} = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2}
$$

Since $ (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 $

So,

$$
\boxed{ r_{\max} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2 (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)} }
$$

**(iv) Condition:**

$$
\boxed{ m_2 > (\sqrt{6} + 2) m_1 }
$$

16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

According to: 

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To show that the **surface magnitude** of a galaxy is independent of distance in a **non-expanding universe**, we need to understand how surface brightness (or surface magnitude) behaves under changes in distance, and why it differs from total brightness or apparent magnitude.

---

## Step 1: Define Surface Brightness and Surface Magnitude

- The **apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is a measure of its total brightness as seen from Earth.
- The **surface brightness** $ \mu $ is the brightness per unit area (e.g., per square arcminute), and the **surface magnitude** is defined as:

$$
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\text{area}}{1 \text{ arcmin}^2} \right)
$$

But more precisely, surface brightness is often expressed in units like **mag/arcsec²** or **mag/arcmin²**, and it’s defined such that if you take a patch of sky with angular area $ A $, then:

$$
\mu = m - 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
$$

Wait — let's be careful here. Actually, **if** the total magnitude is $ m $, and the object subtends an angular area $ A $, then the surface brightness (in mag per unit area) is:

$$
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
$$

This is because if you spread the same total light over a larger area, the surface brightness *decreases* (i.e., becomes fainter), so you add a positive term when area increases.

But actually, standard definition:  
> Surface magnitude $ \mu $ is defined as the magnitude per unit area. So if an object has total magnitude $ m $ and covers area $ A $, then:

$$
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
$$

Yes — this makes sense: if $ A $ increases, $ \mu $ increases (i.e., becomes brighter? Wait — no! This seems backwards.)

Hold on — let’s clarify.

In astronomy, **magnitude** is a logarithmic scale where **lower numbers are brighter**. So if you spread the same total light over a larger area, each unit area becomes dimmer → surface magnitude should **increase** (become higher number).

So yes:

> If an object has total apparent magnitude $ m $ and angular area $ A $, then its surface brightness (in magnitudes per unit area) is:

$$
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
$$

where $ A $ is measured in units consistent with the surface magnitude unit (e.g., arcmin²).

But actually, this formula is not quite correct yet — because the **total magnitude** depends on distance!

Let’s go deeper.

---

## Step 2: How Total Apparent Magnitude Depends on Distance

The **apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to its **absolute magnitude** $ M $ by the distance modulus:

$$
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
$$

where $ d $ is the distance in parsecs.

So total brightness decreases with distance as $ 1/d^2 $, which corresponds to the increase in magnitude by $ 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 $.

---

## Step 3: How Angular Area Depends on Distance

The **angular size** of an object depends on its physical size and distance.

If a galaxy has physical radius $ R $, then at distance $ d $, its angular radius is:

$$
\theta = \frac{R}{d} \quad \text{(in radians)}
$$

So its angular area $ A $ is approximately:

$$
A \propto \theta^2 \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
$$

That is, **the angular area decreases as $ 1/d^2 $**.

---

## Step 4: Combine to Find Surface Magnitude

Recall:

$$
\mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
$$

Substitute expressions for $ m $ and $ A $:

- $ m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 $
- $ A \propto \frac{1}{d^2} $ → so $ \log_{10}(A) = \log_{10}(C) - 2 \log_{10}(d) $, where $ C $ is a constant depending on physical size.

So,

$$
\mu = \left[ M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \right] + 2.5 \left[ \log_{10}(C) - 2 \log_{10}(d) \right]
$$

Simplify:

$$
\mu = M - 5 + \log_{10}(C) \cdot 2.5 + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \log_{10}(d)
$$

Wait — let's compute carefully:

$$
\mu = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 + 2.5 \log_{10}(C) - 5 \log_{10}(d)
$$

Now cancel terms:

$$
5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \log_{10}(d) = 0
$$

So:

$$
\mu = M - 5 + 2.5 \log_{10}(C)
$$

But $ C $ is a constant related to the physical size of the galaxy (since $ A \propto R^2 / d^2 $, so $ C \propto R^2 $).

Thus, **$ \mu $ depends only on the intrinsic properties of the galaxy (its absolute magnitude and physical size)**, and **not on distance $ d $**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

In a **non-expanding universe**, the **surface magnitude** of a galaxy is **independent of distance** because:

- The total apparent magnitude increases with distance (gets fainter) as $ 5 \log_{10}(d) $,
- But the angular area decreases as $ 1/d^2 $, so $ \log_{10}(A) $ decreases as $ -2 \log_{10}(d) $,
- When combined in the surface magnitude formula $ \mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A) $, the distance-dependent terms cancel out.

Therefore, **surface magnitude is invariant with distance** — it is a true measure of the intrinsic brightness per unit area of the galaxy.

---

## Final Answer

In a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of distance because the decrease in total apparent magnitude due to distance is exactly compensated by the decrease in angular area, leading to cancellation of distance-dependent terms in the surface magnitude formula. Thus, surface magnitude is a distance-independent quantity, reflecting the intrinsic surface brightness of the galaxy.",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{1}{u}$

$= \frac{1}{L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2}}$

$= \frac{h^{2}/k}{1 + \frac{h^{2}L}{k}\cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}$

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

where

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

Since a planet in motion does not escape to infinity, its orbit must be an ellipse,

Finally, we prove Kepler’s third law. Using the relations

---

## 🌍 Background: Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force between two masses is:

\[
F = G \frac{M m}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the magnitude of the gravitational force,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M \) is the mass of the central body (e.g., Sun),
- \( m \) is the mass of the orbiting body (e.e., planet),
- \( r \) is the distance between their centers.

This force acts along the line joining the two bodies and is always attractive.

## 📐 Step 1: Derive Kepler’s First Law — The Law of Ellipses

> **Kepler’s First Law**: The orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.

### Derivation:

We consider a planet of mass \( m \) orbiting a much more massive star (Sun) of mass \( M \). Since \( M \gg m \), we can treat the Sun as fixed at the origin.

The gravitational force is a **central force**, meaning it acts along the radial direction and depends only on the distance \( r \).

In classical mechanics, for any central force, the angular momentum \( \vec{L} \) is conserved:

\[
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} = \text{constant}
\]

This implies that the motion is confined to a plane (the orbital plane).

To find the trajectory, we use the **equation of motion** in polar coordinates under central force. The radial component of acceleration is:

\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

And the conservation of angular momentum gives:

\[
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} \Rightarrow \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2}
\]

Substituting into the radial equation:

\[
\ddot{r} - r \left( \frac{L}{m r^2} \right)^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{1}{r^2} \) and make substitution \( u = \frac{1}{r} \), so \( \frac{d}{dt} = \dot{\theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2} \frac{d}{d\theta} = \frac{L u^2}{m} \frac{d}{d\theta} \)

Then:

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM m^2}{L^2}
\]

This is a linear differential equation with solution:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM m^2}{L^2} + A \cos \theta
\]

or

\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM m^2}{L^2} \left( 1 + \frac{A L^2}{GM m^2} \cos \theta \right)
\]

Let \( \varepsilon = \frac{A L^2}{GM m^2} \), then:

\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM m^2}{L^2} (1 + \varepsilon \cos \theta)
\]

This is the polar form of a **conic section** with eccentricity \( \varepsilon \).

For bound orbits (planets), \( \varepsilon < 1 \) → **ellipse**.

✅ Thus, **Kepler’s First Law is derived**: Planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.

---

## 📅 Step 2: Derive Kepler’s Second Law — The Law of Equal Areas

> **Kepler’s Second Law**: A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

### Derivation:

From conservation of angular momentum:

\[
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} = m (\vec{r} \times \vec{v}) = \text{constant}
\]

The rate at which area is swept out (areal velocity) is:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} |\vec{r} \times \vec{v}| = \frac{|\vec{L}|}{2m}
\]

Since \( \vec{L} \) is constant, \( \frac{dA}{dt} \) is constant.

✅ Therefore, **equal areas are swept in equal times** — **Kepler’s Second Law**.

## ⏳ Step 3: Derive Kepler’s Third Law — The Law of Harmonies

> **Kepler’s Third Law**: The square of the orbital period \( T \) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( a \) of its orbit.

\[
T^2 \propto a^3
\]

### Derivation:

Consider a circular orbit first (as a special case of an ellipse, where \( a = r \)).

Centripetal force is provided by gravity:

\[
\frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
\Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

Orbital period \( T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \), so:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{v^2} = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{G M / r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M}
\]

Thus,

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
\Rightarrow T^2 \propto r^3
\]

For elliptical orbits, replace \( r \) with the **semi-major axis** \( a \). In general, for any conic section under inverse-square force, the period depends only on the semi-major axis.

Using the full derivation from the vis-viva equation or integrating the orbital equations, we find:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M + m)} a^3
\]

For planets orbiting the Sun, \( m \ll M \), so:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

✅ Therefore, **Kepler’s Third Law is derived**: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \)

| Kepler’s Law | Derived From Newton’s Law of Gravitation? | Key Derivation Step |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **First Law** (Elliptical Orbits) | ✅ Yes | Solving central force motion → conic sections; bound orbits are ellipses |
| **Second Law** (Equal Areas) | ✅ Yes | Conservation of angular momentum → constant areal velocity |

## 🧠 Conclusion

Newton’s law of universal gravitation provides the theoretical foundation for Kepler’s empirical laws. By applying Newtonian mechanics to the inverse-square gravitational force, we recover all three of Kepler’s laws:

- The shape of orbits (ellipses),
- The varying speed of planets (equal areas),
- The relationship between period and size of orbit (harmonic law).

This unification was a cornerstone of classical physics and demonstrated that the same physical laws govern both Earth and the heavens.

18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

$F =  - G\frac{Mm}{{r}^{2}}$",Yes,,1.071

- **Case I**: Actual observed rotation curve (with dark matter).
- **Case II**: Hypothetical case where all mass is concentrated at the Galactic center (no dark matter).

---

## Step 1: Understand the relation between Oort’s constants and $ \frac{dV}{dR} $

In the solar neighborhood, Oort’s constants are defined as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} R_0 \right)
\quad \text{and} \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 + \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} R_0 \right)
$$

These are standard definitions. Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of the circular velocity $ V(R) = \Omega(R) R $.

Let’s express $ \frac{dV}{dR} $ in terms of $ A $ and $ B $.

Recall:

$$
V(R) = \Omega(R) R \Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dR} = \Omega(R) + R \frac{d\Omega}{dR}
$$

So at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0}
$$

Now, from the definition of $ A $:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right)
\Rightarrow \Omega_0 - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = 2A
$$

From the definition of $ B $:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right)
\Rightarrow \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -2B
$$

Wait — this seems inconsistent with the standard form. Let me double-check the standard definitions.

Actually, **standardly**, Oort’s constants are:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - \frac{d\Omega}{dR} R_0 \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 + \frac{d\Omega}{dR} R_0 \right)
$$

Yes, so then:

Adding these two equations:

$$
A + B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} - \Omega_0 - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right) = - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}
\Rightarrow \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -\frac{A + B}{R_0}
$$

Subtracting:

$$
A - B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} + \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right) = \Omega_0
\Rightarrow \Omega_0 = A - B
$$

Now, we want $ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $

Substitute:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = (A - B) + R_0 \left( -\frac{A + B}{R_0} \right) = A - B - A - B = -2B
$$

✅ So we have a key result:

> $$
\boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -2B }
$$

This holds **in general** for any rotation curve, as long as we define $ A $ and $ B $ via the standard Oort’s constant formulas.

---

## Step 2: Case I — Actual Observed Rotation Curve

In the real Galaxy, the rotation curve is flat or slightly rising at the Sun’s radius. That means:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} \approx 0 \quad \text{(or slightly positive)}
$$

But let’s derive it properly using Oort’s constants.

We don’t know numerical values, but we can relate them to the actual rotation curve.

However, the problem asks us to **derive** the expression, not compute numerically.

But since we already have $ \frac{dV}{dR} = -2B $, and in Case I, we use the actual rotation curve, then:

> For Case I: $ \boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -2B } $, where $ B $ is determined from observations.

But perhaps the problem expects us to express it in terms of physical parameters? Or maybe just leave it as $ -2B $? But that seems too trivial.

Wait — perhaps we need to **derive** $ B $ for each case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to express $ \frac{dV}{dR} $ in terms of known quantities for each model.

Let’s proceed to Case II first.

---

## Step 3: Case II — Point Mass at Center (No Dark Matter)

Assume the entire mass of the Galaxy is concentrated at the Galactic center. Then, by Keplerian dynamics, the circular velocity is:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} \cdot (-1) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

But also, since $ V_0 = \Omega_0 R_0 $, we can write:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0
$$

Now, recall from earlier:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = -2B \Rightarrow -2B = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0 \Rightarrow B = \frac{1}{4} \Omega_0
$$

But again, we might not need to go through this if we already have an expression.

Alternatively, we can compute $ B $ directly from the definition.

Recall:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 + R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right)
$$

For Keplerian motion:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \Omega(R) R \Rightarrow \Omega(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V(R)}{R} \right) = \frac{R V'(R) - V(R)}{R^2}
$$

But $ V'(R) = \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R} $, so:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{R \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{V}{R}\right) - V}{R^2} = \frac{ -\frac{1}{2} V - V }{R^2} = \frac{ -\frac{3}{2} V }{R^2}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $, $ V = V_0 $, so:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{3}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} = -\frac{3}{2} \frac{\Omega_0}{R_0}
$$

Now plug into B:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 + R_0 \cdot \left( -\frac{3}{2} \frac{\Omega_0}{R_0} \right) \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \Omega_0 - \frac{3}{2} \Omega_0 \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0 \right)
= \frac{1}{4} \Omega_0
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = -2B = -2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \Omega_0 = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0
$$

Which matches our earlier direct calculation.

So for Case II:

> $$
\boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0 }
$$

---

## Step 4: Case I — Real Galaxy (Flat Rotation Curve)

In reality, the rotation curve is approximately flat near the Sun, meaning $ \frac{dV}{dR} \approx 0 $.

More precisely, observations show that $ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} \approx 0 $, which implies $ B \approx 0 $.

But to derive it formally, we can use the same formula:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -2B
$$

So for Case I, since we are told to consider the actual observed rotation curve, we must use the **observed value** of $ B $, which is approximately zero.

But again, the problem says ""derive expressions"", so perhaps we should leave it in terms of $ B $, or state that it is zero?

Wait — let's think differently.

Perhaps the problem expects us to **derive** $ \frac{dV}{dR} $ using the expressions for $ V_r $ and $ V_t $, and match to Oort’s constants.

But we already did that.

Alternatively, perhaps we are to express $ \frac{dV}{dR} $ without reference to $ B $, but in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, etc., for each case.

We already did that for Case II.

For Case I, since the rotation curve is flat, $ \frac{dV}{dR} = 0 $.

But is that exact? Not quite — it’s approximately zero. In fact, recent measurements suggest a slight rise or fall, but often approximated as flat.

However, since the problem doesn’t give data, we must assume the standard approximation.

Therefore:

> For Case I: $ \boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = 0 } $

But wait — is that derivable? Only if we assume flatness.

But perhaps we can derive it from the fact that in the solar neighborhood, the rotation curve is flat, so $ \frac{dV}{dR} = 0 $.

Alternatively, we can say:

In Case I, the observed rotation curve implies that $ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} $ is equal to the measured gradient, which is approximately zero.

But since the problem says “derive”, and we have already derived that $ \frac{dV}{dR} = -2B $, and in the real Galaxy, observations show that $ B \approx 0 $, we can conclude:

> For Case I: $ \boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = 0 } $

---

## ✅ Final Answers:

### Case I (Actual Galaxy):
$$
\boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = 0 }
$$

### Case II (Point Mass at Center):
$$
\boxed{ \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0 }
$$

---

## Additional Notes:

- The derivation relies on the relation $ \frac{dV}{dR} = -2B $, which comes from the definitions of Oort’s constants.
- In Case II, we used Keplerian dynamics to find $ \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_0 $.
- In Case I, we used observational evidence that the rotation curve is flat at the Sun’s position.

---

## Step 1: Recall the given expressions

The observed velocities are:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

We are told that in the solar neighborhood, $ D \ll R_0 $, so we can expand $ \Omega $ around $ R_0 $ using a Taylor expansion:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0)
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, the distance $ R $ of the cloud from GC is approximately:

$$
R \approx R_0 + D \cos l
$$

Why? Because if we consider the Sun at distance $ R_0 $ from GC, and the cloud is at distance $ D $ from the Sun, then along the Galactic longitude $ l $, the projection of $ D $ onto the radial direction (toward or away from GC) is $ D \cos l $. So:

$$
R = R_0 + D \cos l
$$

Therefore,

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cdot D \cos l
$$

So,

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cdot D \cos l
$$

Let’s denote:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} = \Omega'
$$

Then,

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \Omega' D \cos l
$$

---

## Step 2: Plug into expressions for $ V_r $ and $ V_t $

### For $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx \Omega' D \cos l \cdot R_0 \sin l = \Omega' R_0 D \sin l \cos l
$$

Recall that $ \sin(2l) = 2 \sin l \cos l $, so:

$$
V_r = \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 D \sin(2l)
$$

But we are told that in the solar neighborhood, the first-order approximation is:

$$
V_r = A D \sin(2l)
$$

Therefore, comparing:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0
$$

---

### For $ V_t $:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

Substitute $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \Omega' D \cos l $:

First term:

$$
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx \Omega' D \cos l \cdot R_0 \cos l = \Omega' R_0 D \cos^2 l
$$

Second term: $ -\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D $, since $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $ for small $ D $.

So,

$$
V_t \approx \Omega' R_0 D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Now use identity: $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos(2l)}{2} $, so:

$$
V_t \approx \Omega' R_0 D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos(2l)}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 D + \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 D \cos(2l) - \Omega_0 D
$$

Group terms:

$$
V_t = \left( \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 - \Omega_0 \right) D + \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 D \cos(2l)
$$

But we are told that the approximation is:

$$
V_t = A D \cos(2l) + B D
$$

Comparing coefficients:

- Coefficient of $ D \cos(2l) $: $ A = \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 $
- Constant term (coefficient of $ D $): $ B = \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 - \Omega_0 $

Wait — this matches our expression for $ A $! So:

$$
B = A - \Omega_0
$$

But we want everything in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $, not $ \Omega_0 $ or $ \Omega' $.

---

## Step 3: Express $ \Omega_0 $ and $ \Omega' $ in terms of $ V_0 $ and $ \frac{dV}{dR} $

We know:

- Rotational velocity $ V = \Omega R $
- So $ \Omega = V/R $

Therefore,

$$
\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

And,

$$
\Omega' = \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{R \frac{dV}{dR} - V}{R^2}
$$

So at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\Omega' = \frac{R_0 \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

---

## Step 4: Substitute into expressions for $ A $ and $ B $

Recall:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \Omega' R_0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{R_0 \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0^2} \cdot R_0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{R_0 \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0}
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)}
$$

Similarly, for $ B $:

$$
B = A - \Omega_0 = A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So:

$$
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} - \frac{3}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Thus:

$$
\boxed{B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} - 3 \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)}
$$

---

## ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) \\
B &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - 3 \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
\end{aligned}

---

## Step 1: Mechanical Energy in a Keplerian Orbit

For a test mass $ \Delta m $ orbiting a central mass $ M $ in a circular orbit of radius $ r $, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + gravitational potential) is:

$$
E(r) = K(r) + U(r)
$$

In a **Keplerian circular orbit**, the orbital speed $ v $ satisfies:

$$
\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$

So the kinetic energy is:

$$
K(r) = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \cdot \frac{GM}{r}
$$

The gravitational potential energy (using the standard convention where $ U \to 0 $ as $ r \to \infty $):

$$
U(r) = -\frac{GM \Delta m}{r}
$$

Thus, the total mechanical energy is:

$$
E(r) = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \cdot \frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM \Delta m}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{GM \Delta m}{r}
$$

Therefore, the **mechanical energy per unit mass** is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

---

## Step 2: Energy Released During Inward Spiral

The problem states that the gas element starts at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ and spirals inward to radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $. Since the process is **very slow** (adiabatic, quasi-static), we assume that at each point along the spiral, the gas is approximately in a **circular Keplerian orbit** — even though it’s losing angular momentum via viscosity, the orbit remains nearly circular at each radius.

Thus, the **change in mechanical energy per unit mass** from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $ is:

$$
\Delta \left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right) = \frac{E(r)}{\Delta m} - \frac{E(R_{\text{max}})}{\Delta m} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

$$
= -\frac{GM}{2r} + \frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} - \frac{1}{r} \right)
$$

But note: since $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, we have $ \frac{1}{r} \gg \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} $, so this expression becomes **negative** — meaning energy is being **released** (lost) by the gas element as it spirals inward.

However, the question asks for the **energy released**, which is the **magnitude** of the energy lost. So we take the absolute value or, more precisely, the negative of the change (since energy is released):

> The energy released per unit mass is the **decrease** in mechanical energy:

$$
\text{Energy released per unit mass} = -\Delta \left( \frac{E}{\Delta m} \right) = -\left[ \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} - \frac{1}{r} \right) \right] = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

Now, because $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, we can approximate:

$$
\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \approx \frac{1}{r}
$$

So, to leading order, the energy released per unit mass is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }
$$

---

## Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }
$$

This is the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas element as it spirals from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, assuming Keplerian orbits and slow viscous dissipation.

---

## Physical Interpretation:

- As matter spirals inward in an accretion disk, its orbital speed increases (as $ v \propto r^{-1/2} $).
- However, the **total mechanical energy** becomes **more negative** (i.e., decreases), meaning energy must be radiated away.
- The amount released is half the gravitational potential energy well depth at radius $ r $, consistent with the virial theorem for circular orbits: $ K = -\frac{1}{2} U $, so $ E = K + U = -\frac{1}{2} |U| $.
- Thus, when material falls from infinity to radius $ r $, it releases $ \frac{GM}{2r} $ per unit mass — which matches our result (since starting from $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $ would give exactly that).

The goal is to find an expression for the Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $ (speed of light), and $ T $.

---

## Key Assumptions:

- The universe expands according to the law:  
  $$
  S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
  $$
  where $ s $ is the initial separation between the Solar System and the mirror at time $ t=0 $, and $ S(t) $ is the separation at time $ t $.

- The mirror is placed at distance $ D $ — this is likely the **initial** distance, so $ s = D $.

- The expansion causes the distance to increase over time.

- The laser beam travels to the mirror and back. However, because space is expanding, the distance the light must travel increases during its journey.

- We are told to use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, if needed.

---

## Step-by-step Analysis:

Let’s denote:

- $ t = 0 $: moment when the laser is emitted from Earth.
- At that moment, the mirror is at distance $ D $ from Earth.
- Due to expansion, the distance to the mirror increases as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

The laser beam travels outward to the mirror. But since space is expanding, the distance the light must cover increases as it travels. This is similar to the “cosmic redshift” problem or the “expanding balloon” analogy.

However, here’s the key point: **the mirror is fixed in space**, meaning it is comoving with the expansion — i.e., its proper motion is due to the Hubble flow. So, the mirror is moving away from us as the universe expands.

But wait — the mirror is **not moving through space**; it's just being carried along by the expansion. So the distance between Earth and mirror grows as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

Now, the light beam is emitted at $ t=0 $, and reaches the mirror at some time $ t_1 $. At that time, the distance to the mirror is $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} $.

But the light has been traveling for time $ t_1 $, and during that time, the speed of light is constant $ c $, so the **distance traveled by light** is $ c t_1 $. However, because space is expanding, the physical distance to the mirror is increasing during the light’s journey.

This is a classic problem in cosmology: **light traveling in an expanding universe**.

In general, for a universe with scale factor $ a(t) $, the light travel time satisfies:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{dt}{a(t)} = \frac{D}{c a(0)}
$$

But in our case, the scale factor is exponential: $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, so $ a(0) = 1 $.

Thus, the equation becomes:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t} dt = \frac{D}{c}
$$

Compute the integral:

$$
\left[ -\frac{1}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} \right]_0^{t_1} = \frac{D}{c}
\Rightarrow -\frac{1}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - 1 \right) = \frac{D}{c}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{H_0} \left( 1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right) = \frac{D}{c}
$$

So,

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{D H_0}{c}
\quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

This gives the time $ t_1 $ it takes for the light to reach the mirror.

---

Now, the light reflects off the mirror and starts returning. But now, the mirror is moving away from Earth, and space is still expanding.

So, on the return trip, the light must travel back *through* expanding space.

At time $ t_1 $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} $.

Let $ t_2 $ be the time it takes for the light to return to Earth. Then the total round-trip time is $ T = t_1 + t_2 $.

For the return trip, we need to solve for the time $ t_2 $ such that the light travels back from the mirror to Earth, while space is still expanding.

The same logic applies: the light travels backward, and the scale factor is still $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $.

But now, we have to integrate from time $ t_1 $ to $ t_1 + t_2 $, and the distance the light covers is equal to the comoving distance times the scale factor.

Actually, since the mirror is at comoving distance $ D $ (because it was placed there initially and moves with the expansion), the comoving distance doesn’t change. So the light must travel a comoving distance $ D $ on the way out and $ D $ on the way back.

Wait — perhaps we can simplify using comoving coordinates.

Let’s switch to comoving coordinates.

---

## Alternate Approach: Comoving Coordinates

In comoving coordinates, the mirror is always at coordinate $ x = D $, and Earth is at $ x = 0 $. The physical distance is $ S(t) = a(t) D = D e^{H_0 t} $.

Light travels at speed $ c $ in physical coordinates, but in comoving coordinates, the speed is not constant.

The relation between physical and comoving distance is:

$$
dx_{\text{phys}} = a(t) dx_{\text{comoving}}
$$

But for light, $ dx_{\text{phys}}/dt = c $, so:

$$
\frac{dx_{\text{comoving}}}{dt} = \frac{c}{a(t)} = c e^{-H_0 t}
$$

Therefore, to go from Earth to mirror (comoving distance $ D $):

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
\Rightarrow \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}\right) = D
$$

Which is the same as Equation 1 above.

Similarly, for the return trip: the light travels from the mirror (comoving coordinate $ D $) back to Earth (comoving coordinate 0).

The comoving distance to cover is again $ D $, but now the scale factor is changing as before.

So:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Wait — no! Actually, the light returns from time $ t_1 $ to $ t_1 + t_2 $, and the comoving distance covered is $ D $, so:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Compute:

$$
c \int_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2} e^{-H_0 t} dt = c \left[ -\frac{1}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} \right]_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2}
= \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} \right)
= D
$$

So:

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} = \frac{D H_0}{c}
\quad \text{(Equation 2)}
$$

But from Equation 1:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{D H_0}{c}
\Rightarrow e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{D H_0}{c}
$$

Plug into Equation 2:

Left-hand side:

$$
\left(1 - \frac{D H_0}{c}\right) - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} = \frac{D H_0}{c}
\Rightarrow 1 - \frac{D H_0}{c} - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} = \frac{D H_0}{c}
\Rightarrow 1 - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

But $ t_1 + t_2 = T $, so:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
\quad \text{(Final Equation)}
$$

---

## Now Solve for $ H_0 $

We have:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

We are told we may use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $. Since $ H_0 T $ is likely small (if $ T $ is not too large, and $ H_0 \sim 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} $, then $ H_0 T \ll 1 $ if $ T $ is years or even millions of years), we can approximate:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \cdots
\Rightarrow 1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

So:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} \approx \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx \frac{2 D}{c}
$$

Solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{2 D}{c} \approx \frac{H_0 T^2}{2}
\Rightarrow H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2 D}{c} \right)
= \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4 D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait — this seems odd. Let’s check dimensions.

$ H_0 $ should have units of inverse time. $ \frac{2}{T} $ is inverse time, good. $ \frac{4D}{c T^2} $ also has units of inverse time? Let’s see:

- $ D $: length
- $ c $: length/time → $ D/c $: time
- So $ \frac{D}{c T^2} $: time / time² = 1/time → yes, correct.

But let’s think physically: if $ D $ is the initial distance, and $ cT $ is the distance light would travel in vacuum, then $ \frac{D}{cT} $ is dimensionless. If $ T $ is much larger than $ D/c $, then the first term dominates.

But perhaps we can write a cleaner expression.

Alternatively, go back to the exact equation:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

If we assume $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, then $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T $, so:

$$
1 - (1 - H_0 T) = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
\Rightarrow H_0 T = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
\Rightarrow T = \frac{2 D}{c}
\Rightarrow H_0 \text{ cancels out?}
$$

That can't be right — unless $ H_0 = 0 $, which contradicts the assumption.

Ah! This suggests that the **first-order approximation is insufficient** — we must include the next term.

So go back to:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
= \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Then:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{H_0^2 T^2}{2} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = \frac{2 D}{c}
\Rightarrow \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = T - \frac{2 D}{c}
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2 D}{c} \right)
= \boxed{ \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4 D}{c T^2} }
$$

---

## Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}
$$

This is the expression for the Hubble constant in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $, under the given assumptions and using the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ (actually, we used up to second order to get a nontrivial result).

---

## Physical Interpretation:

- The term $ \frac{2}{T} $ would be the value if there were no expansion — i.e., if the round-trip time were just $ T = 2D/c $, then $ H_0 = 0 $, which matches.

- The correction term $ -\frac{4D}{c T^2} $ accounts for the expansion: as the universe expands, the light takes longer to return, so $ T > 2D/c $, and thus $ H_0 $ is smaller than $ 2/T $.

Indeed, if $ T > 2D/c $, then $ H_0 < 2/T $, which makes sense — expansion slows down the round-trip time? Wait, actually, expansion increases the distance, so light takes longer, so $ T $ is larger than $ 2D/c $, so $ 2/T $ is smaller, and the correction term subtracts more, making $ H_0 $ even smaller — which is consistent.

But note: in reality, in an expanding universe, the round-trip time is longer than $ 2D/c $, so $ T > 2D/c $, and our formula gives $ H_0 < 2/T $, which is plausible.

$L_{GW}$ has dimensions of energy per time, or $\frac{[M][L]^2}{[T]^3}$, where $[M]$ is mass, $[L]$ is length, and $[T]$ is time. $G$ has dimensions $\frac{[L]^3}{[M][T]^2}$, $c$ has $\frac{[L]}{[T]}$, $M$ has $[M]$ and $R$ has $[L]$. From the problem statement,

- Physical constants: $G$ (gravitational constant), $c$ (speed of light),
- System parameters: $M$, $R$,
- A dimensionless constant: $\frac{2}{5}$.

Also, it is stated that **$c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power** in the expression.

---

## Step 1: Dimensional Analysis

We need to find an expression for $L_{GW}$ with dimensions of **power**, i.e., energy per unit time. So,

$$
[L_{GW}] = \frac{[E]}{[T]} = \frac{M L^2 T^{-2}}{T} = M L^2 T^{-3}
$$

We are to construct this from:

- $G$: gravitational constant → $[G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}$
- $c$: speed of light → $[c] = L T^{-1}$
- $M$: mass → $[M] = M$
- $R$: orbital radius → $[R] = L$

Let’s suppose the form is:

$$
L_{GW} = k \cdot G^a c^b M^d R^e
$$

where $k = \frac{2}{5}$ is the dimensionless constant, and we must determine exponents $a, b, d, e$ such that the dimensions match.

So, compute the dimensions of the right-hand side:

$$
[G^a c^b M^d R^e] = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a \cdot (L T^{-1})^b \cdot M^d \cdot L^e
$$

Grouping by dimensions:

- Mass: $M^{-a + d}$
- Length: $L^{3a + b + e}$
- Time: $T^{-2a - b}$

Set equal to $M L^2 T^{-3}$:

So we get the system of equations:

1. $-a + d = 1$  → (mass)
2. $3a + b + e = 2$ → (length)
3. $-2a - b = -3$ → (time)

Also, we are told that **$c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power**, so $b = e$.

---

## Step 2: Solve the system

From equation (3):  
$-2a - b = -3$ ⇒ $2a + b = 3$ → Equation (A)

From equation (1):  
$d = a + 1$ → Equation (B)

From equation (2) and $b = e$:  
$3a + b + b = 2$ ⇒ $3a + 2b = 2$ → Equation (C)

Now solve Equations (A) and (C):

Equation (A): $2a + b = 3$

Equation (C): $3a + 2b = 2$

Multiply (A) by 2: $4a + 2b = 6$

Subtract (C): $(4a + 2b) - (3a + 2b) = 6 - 2$ ⇒ $a = 4$

Plug into (A): $2(4) + b = 3$ ⇒ $8 + b = 3$ ⇒ $b = -5$

Then $e = b = -5$

From (B): $d = a + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$

---

## Step 3: Write the expression

Thus,

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

We can write this more neatly as:

$$
\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$

---

## Step 4: Sanity Check

Check dimensions:

- $G^4$: $[G]^4 = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^4 = M^{-4} L^{12} T^{-8}$
- $M^5$: $M^5$
- $c^5$: $(L T^{-1})^5 = L^5 T^{-5}$
- $R^5$: $L^5$

So overall:

Numerator: $M^{-4} L^{12} T^{-8} \cdot M^5 = M L^{12} T^{-8}$

Denominator: $L^5 T^{-5} \cdot L^5 = L^{10} T^{-5}$

So total: $M L^{12} T^{-8} / (L^{10} T^{-5}) = M L^2 T^{-3}$ — correct!

Also, $c$ and $R$ both have exponent $-5$, as required.

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"We are given a binary neutron star system with two identical stars of mass $M$ each, orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. The system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the power radiated is given by:

$$

Our goal is to find $\frac{dR}{dt}$, the rate at which the orbital radius decreases due to energy loss via gravitational wave emission.

---

## Step 1: Understand the physical picture

In Newtonian gravity, the total mechanical energy $E$ of the binary system in a circular orbit is:

$$
E = \text{Kinetic Energy} + \text{Potential Energy}
$$

For two bodies of equal mass $M$, orbiting each other in a circular orbit of radius $R$, the distance between them is $2R$ (since they orbit around their center of mass, located midway between them).

Wait — actually, **in a binary system**, if each star orbits the center of mass, and they are separated by distance $d$, then each orbits at radius $r = d/2$. But in this problem, it says “circular orbit of radius $R$”, so we must interpret $R$ as the **distance from each star to the center of mass**.

Thus, the **separation between the two stars** is $2R$.

So let’s compute the total energy $E$ for the system.

---

## Step 2: Compute total energy $E$

The potential energy (gravitational) for two masses $M$ separated by distance $2R$ is:

$$
U = -\frac{GM^2}{2R}
$$

Now, kinetic energy: each star moves in a circle of radius $R$ around the center of mass.

The centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{GM^2}{(2R)^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R}
$$

Solve for $v^2$:

$$
\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{GM}{4R}
$$

Then kinetic energy per star is $\frac{1}{2} M v^2 = \frac{1}{2} M \cdot \frac{GM}{4R} = \frac{GM^2}{8R}$

Total kinetic energy for both stars: $2 \cdot \frac{GM^2}{8R} = \frac{GM^2}{4R}$

Thus, total energy:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{GM^2}{4R} - \frac{GM^2}{2R} = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}
$$

✅ So,

$$
E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}
$$

---

## Step 3: Relate energy loss to orbital shrinkage

Gravitational wave emission causes the system to lose energy: $\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{GW}$

Therefore,

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

But also, since $E = -\frac{GM^2}{4R}$, we can differentiate $E$ with respect to time:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{GM^2}{4R} \right) = -\frac{GM^2}{4} \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(R^{-1}) = -\frac{GM^2}{4} \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

---

## Step 4: Set expressions for $\frac{dE}{dt}$ equal

We now have two expressions for $\frac{dE}{dt}$:

1. From GW emission: $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$

2. From energy dependence on $R$: $\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}$

Set them equal:

$$
\frac{GM^2}{4R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

---

## Step 5: Solve for $\frac{dR}{dt}$

Multiply both sides by $4R^2 / GM^2$:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4R^2}{GM^2}
= -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 R^3 c^5}
$$

✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 R^3 c^5}}
$$

---

## Interpretation

The negative sign indicates that the orbital radius $R$ is decreasing over time — consistent with energy loss via gravitational radiation causing the orbit to shrink.

This expression gives the rate of orbital decay for a binary neutron star system under the assumption of circular orbits and Newtonian dynamics, corrected for energy loss via gravitational waves. It matches known results in gravitational wave physics (e.g., Peters & Mathews 1963, or standard GR text derivations).",0.49
