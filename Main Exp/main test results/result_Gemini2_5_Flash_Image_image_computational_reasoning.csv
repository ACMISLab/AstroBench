1,"The angular resolution of the human eye is 14/0.6 = 23”, while that of a 2.16-meter telescope is 14/216 = 0.06”. Based on these data, the human eye can distinguish details separated by 10 cm at a distance of 0.9 km, whereas the 2.16-meter telescope can extend this capability to more than 300 km. However, this is an ideal situation considering only the diffraction limit. In reality, the resolution is affected not only by diffraction but also by the quality of the optical system, as well as atmospheric transparency and stability. In astronomy, the degradation of stellar image quality and resolution caused by atmospheric turbulence and scattering is called *seeing*, and the size of the seeing disk is used to evaluate the atmospheric optical quality at a telescope site. Even at observatory sites with excellent seeing, the seeing disk can still reach about 1”. In modern cities, sky light pollution is severe: not only is the resolution extremely poor, but even the basic “ability to see” is greatly diminished. People who have never left large cities have never seen the magnificent sight of a star-studded sky, nor have they appreciated the beauty of the bright Milky Way. Lacking direct experience inevitably weakens one’s affection for nature and spirit of exploration. <image>JSTL-Fig-1</image> As shown in the figure, some computed data under the assumption of exceptionally good atmospheric conditions are listed. Now, based on the limiting magnitude *m*, where a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, calculate the distance *r* at which a “single candle flame” can be seen.","Step 1: The limiting magnitude is the magnitude of the faintest celestial object that can be seen. Since a star of magnitude *m* produces an illumination of $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux, this is the minimum illumination that can be “seen.” Because illumination is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a candle produces an illumination of 1 lux at a distance of 1 meter. Therefore, at a distance *r* meters, the illumination produced by a candle is $1/r^2$ lux. When this illumination equals $E_L$, the corresponding *r* is the distance at which a candle can be seen. Thus, from $1/r^2 = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$, we can solve for *r* in meters. Hence,

Get: 

$r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}}}$ meters  
$= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.54}} \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers  
$= 0.6275 \times 10^{0.2m}$ kilometers.

Here *m* is the limiting magnitude. For the human eye, *m = 6.5*, so $r = 0.6275 \times 10^{1.3}$ kilometers $= 12.5$ kilometers.

Final_answer: $\boxed{r = 12.5 km}$",r = 12.5 km,Yes,"The problem asks to calculate the distance *r* at which a “single candle flame” can be seen, based on the limiting magnitude *m* and a given formula for stellar illumination. Although the table provides data for different telescope apertures, the context of the introductory text and the first entry in the table suggests we should calculate this value for the human eye.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1.  **Identify the limiting magnitude (m) for the human eye:**
    From the table, for ""人眼 (6毫米)"" (Human eye (6 mm)), the ""极限星等数"" (Limiting magnitude) is $m = 6.5$.

2.  **Calculate the limiting illumination ($E_L$) for a star of magnitude 6.5:**
    The problem provides the formula: $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4m}$ lux.
    Substitute $m = 6.5$ into the formula:
    $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.4 \times 6.5}$
    $E_L = 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-2.6}$
    To calculate $10^{-2.6}$:
    $10^{-2.6} \approx 0.002511886$
    So, $E_L \approx 2.54 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.002511886$
    $E_L \approx 6.38018 \times 10^{-9}$ lux

3.  **Assume the luminous intensity ($I_c$) of a ""single candle flame"":**
    In astronomy and photometry, a ""standard candle"" often refers to a source with a luminous intensity of approximately 1 candela (cd). We will assume $I_c = 1$ cd.

4.  **Calculate the distance (r) using the inverse square law for illumination:**
    The illumination $E$ from a point source with luminous intensity $I_c$ at a distance $r$ is given by $E = I_c / r^2$.
    At the limiting distance, the illumination from the candle flame equals the limiting illumination $E_L$:
    $E_L = I_c / r^2$
    Rearrange to solve for $r$:
    $r^2 = I_c / E_L$
    $r^2 = 1 \text{ cd} / (6.38018 \times 10^{-9} \text{ lux})$
    $r^2 \approx 156734265$ m$^2$
    $r = \sqrt{156734265}$ m
    $r \approx 12519.35$ m

5.  **Convert the distance to kilometers:**
    $r \approx 12.519$ km

Rounding to one decimal place, consistent with some values in the table:

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{12.5 km}}$",0.63
2,"<image>JSTL-Fig-2</image>As shown in the figure, David is researching an Earth-like exoplanet near the constellation of Bootes, orbiting a star twice the mass of our Sun. On March 14, 2025, the planet was observed at 3 AU from its parent star. After some time, David observes it again and finds that it has already passed its farthest point from the star and is now at 4 AU. If the planet is known to have a period of 5 years and an eccentricity of 0.5, what is the shortest amount of time that could have passed since the first observation on March 14, 2025? Assume that David views the orbit face-on and that the exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points.","Step1: First, we need to find the planet’s semi-major axis through the Kepler’s third law.

Get:

$\frac{a^3}{T^2} = M$

$a = \sqrt[3]{MT^2} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 5^2} \approx 3.684 \text{ AU}$

Step2: Next, let's find the true anomaly at 3 AU and at 4 AU. This is to give the position of the planet in the ellipse orbit. Remember that when the planet is at 3 AU, it is before the planet passes its farthest distance to its parent star, i.e. its true anomaly must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ.$ This also means that the true anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ since it has passed its farthest distance.

Get: 

$r=\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos f}$

$\cos f=\frac{1}{e}\left(\frac{a(1-e^{2})}{r}-1\right)$

$f_{3}\text{ AU }=99^{\circ}5^{\prime}27^{\prime\prime}$

$f_{4}\text{ AU }=231^{\circ}47^{\prime}36^{\prime\prime}$

Step3: From the true anomaly, we must convert it to eccentric anomaly. Similar to before, the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ and the eccentric anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between 180° and 360°.

Get:

$\cos E = \frac{e + \cos f}{1 + e \cos f}$

$E_{3 \text{ AU}} = 68^\circ 12^{\prime} 7.2^{\prime\prime}$

$E_{4 \text{ AU}} = 260^\circ 7^{\prime} 18.9^{\prime\prime}$

Step4: From the eccentric anomaly, we must convert it to mean anomaly. Similar to before, the mean anomaly when the planet is at 3 AU must be between 0 and $\pi$ and the mean anomaly when the planet is at 4 AU must be between π and 2π. (The calculation below is in radians)

Get:

$M = E - e \sin E$

$M_{3 \text{ AU}} = 0.7261 \text{ rad}$

$M_{4 \text{ AU}} = 5.0326 \text{ rad}$

Step5: From the mean anomaly, we can find the elapsed time since March 14, 2025.

Get:

$M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \times (t - t_0)$

$\Delta M = \frac{2\pi}{T} \Delta t$

$\Delta t = \Delta M \times \frac{T}{2\pi} = (M_{4 \text{ AU}} - M_{3 \text{ AU}}) \times \frac{5 \text{ yrs}}{2\pi}$

$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$

Final_answer:  $\boxed{\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}}$",$\Delta t \approx 3.427 \text{ years}$,Yes,"The problem asks for the shortest amount of time elapsed between two observations of an exoplanet. We are given the following information:
1.  **Orbital period (P):** 5 years
2.  **Eccentricity (e):** 0.5
3.  **Star mass:** 2 solar masses (M_star = 2 M_sun)
4.  **First observation distance (r1):** 3 AU (on March 14, 2025)
5.  **Second observation distance (r2):** 4 AU
6.  **Condition 1:** The planet has already passed its farthest point (apastron) when observed at r2.
7.  **Condition 2:** The exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points. This implies the planet crossed the major axis (specifically, apastron) between the two observations.

**Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axis (a).**
Using Kepler's Third Law, P^2 = a^3 / (M_star/M_sun), where P is in years, a is in AU, and M_star/M_sun is the star's mass in solar masses.
(5 years)^2 = a^3 / 2 M_sun
25 = a^3 / 2
a^3 = 50
a = (50)^(1/3) AU ≈ 3.68403 AU

**Step 2: Determine the Eccentric Anomaly (E) for each observation point.**
The distance `r` from the focus (star) is related to the semi-major axis `a` and eccentric anomaly `E` by the equation:
r = a(1 - e cos(E))
Rearranging to solve for cos(E):
cos(E) = (a - r) / (ae)

For the first observation (r1 = 3 AU):
cos(E1) = (3.68403 - 3) / (3.68403 * 0.5)
cos(E1) = 0.68403 / 1.842015 ≈ 0.37134
E1 = arccos(0.37134) ≈ 1.1901 radians (or 68.20 degrees)

For the second observation (r2 = 4 AU):
cos(E2_ref) = (3.68403 - 4) / (3.68403 * 0.5)
cos(E2_ref) = -0.31597 / 1.842015 ≈ -0.17153
E2_ref = arccos(-0.17153) ≈ 1.7432 radians (or 99.88 degrees)

**Step 3: Apply the conditions to determine the correct E values.**
*   ""The planet has already passed its farthest point (apastron) when observed at r2."" Apastron occurs at E = π radians (180 degrees). This means r1 is observed before apastron, and r2 is observed after apastron. So, E1 should be in the range (0, π) and E2 should be in the range (π, 2π).
*   ""The exoplanet’s velocity component along the semimajor axis has opposite sign at the two observation points."" If we align the major axis along the x-axis with the star at (-ae, 0), the x-coordinate of the planet is a cos(E). The x-component of velocity (vx) is proportional to -sin(E) (assuming positive angular velocity).
    *   If E is in (0, π), sin(E) > 0, so vx < 0 (moving towards apastron).
    *   If E is in (π, 2π), sin(E) < 0, so vx > 0 (moving away from apastron).
    This condition is consistent with E1 being before apastron and E2 after apastron, as it implies crossing apastron.
    Therefore, E1 ≈ 1.1901 radians is correct (it's in 0 to π).
    For E2, since the reference angle 1.7432 radians is in (0, π), the actual E2 (which is in π to 2π) must be:
    E2 = 2π - E2_ref = 2π - 1.7432 ≈ 4.5399 radians (or 260.11 degrees).

**Step 4: Calculate the Mean Anomaly (M) for each observation point.**
The Mean Anomaly M is related to the eccentric anomaly E by Kepler's Equation:
M = E - e sin(E)

For E1 ≈ 1.1901 radians:
sin(E1) = sin(1.1901) ≈ 0.92867
M1 = 1.1901 - 0.5 * 0.92867 ≈ 1.1901 - 0.464335 ≈ 0.725775 radians

For E2 ≈ 4.5399 radians:
sin(E2) = sin(4.5399) ≈ -0.98518
M2 = 4.5399 - 0.5 * (-0.98518) ≈ 4.5399 + 0.49259 ≈ 5.03249 radians

**Step 5: Calculate the time elapsed.**
The time elapsed (Δt) between two points is proportional to the difference in their mean anomalies (ΔM):
Δt = (P / 2π) * ΔM
ΔM = M2 - M1 (since M increases with time)
ΔM = 5.03249 - 0.725775 ≈ 4.306715 radians

Δt = (5 years / (2 * π)) * 4.306715
Δt = (5 / 6.283185) * 4.306715
Δt ≈ 0.795775 * 4.306715
Δt ≈ 3.4270 years

Rounding to two decimal places, the shortest amount of time passed is 3.43 years.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{3.43 years}}$",1.1025
3,"<image>JSTL-Fig-3</image>It may be useful to know the semi-latus rectum of an ellipse is the distance between one of its foci and the point on the ellipse immediately above or below it, as shown in the diagram below. Consider a highly eccentric planet with a semi-latus rectum that is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. What is its eccentricity?","Step1: By constructing a right triangle, using the two foci and the point on the semi-latus rectum, we can find that the semi-latus rectum length $\ell$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$.

Get:

$y^2 = \ell^2 = 4a^2e^2$

where $y$ is the distance between the point on the semi-latus rectum and the other focus (the one not directly below it), i.e., the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Step2: Since an ellipse is defined such that all points on its circumference have a constant sum of distances from the foci $2a$.

Get:

$y + \ell = 2a$

Step3: We can now solve these equations, most easily by using difference of squares on the first and then dividing by the second to obtain $y - \ell = 2ae^2$, and it is now easy to see that $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$. We now rearrange for $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\ell}{a}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\ell}{a}$. Plugging in $\frac{\ell}{a} = 0.01$

Get:

$e=0.995$.

Final_answer:  $\boxed{e=0.995}$",$e=0.995$,Yes,"*   **Understanding the relationship between semi-latus rectum, semi-major axis, and eccentricity:**
    For an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum (often denoted as `p` or `l`) is related to the semi-major axis (`a`) and eccentricity (`e`) by the formula:
    `p = a (1 - e^2)`

*   **Given information:**
    The semi-latus rectum is nearly a hundred times smaller than its semi-major axis. This can be written as:
    `p ≈ a / 100`
    Or, as a ratio:
    `p / a ≈ 1 / 100`

*   **Substitute the ratio into the formula:**
    From `p = a (1 - e^2)`, we can rearrange to get:
    `p / a = 1 - e^2`

    Now, substitute the given ratio:
    `1 / 100 ≈ 1 - e^2`
    `0.01 ≈ 1 - e^2`

*   **Solve for eccentricity (e):**
    `e^2 ≈ 1 - 0.01`
    `e^2 ≈ 0.99`
    `e ≈ sqrt(0.99)`

*   **Calculate the numerical value:**
    `e ≈ 0.994987...`

*   **Rounding:**
    Since the problem states ""nearly a hundred times smaller,"" an approximate answer is appropriate. Rounding to a few significant figures, we get 0.995. This value is close to 1, which confirms it's a ""highly eccentric"" orbit as stated in the problem.

The final answer is $\boxed{0.995}$",0.9555
4,"<image>JSTL-Fig-4</image>As shown in the figure, what is the geodesic distance between Boston (42°21'37"" N, 71°3'28"" W) and Mumbai (19°04'34"" N, 72°52'39"" E)? Assume that the Earth is perfectly spherical.","Step1: If we project it to Earth, point A would be the North Pole, point B would be Boston, and point C would be Mumbai. From this, we can infer that side a is the geodesic distance. With the cosine formula:

$\cos a = \cos b \cos c + \sin b \sin c \cos A = \cos(90 - \phi_{Boston}) \cos(90 - \phi_{Mumbai}) + \sin(90 - \phi_{Boston}) \sin(90 - \phi_{Mumbai}) \cos(\lambda_{Boston} - \lambda_{Mumbai})$

Get:

$a \approx 110°8'20'' \approx 1.9223 \text{ rad}$

Step2: Now, convert the geodesic distance from angle to length unit

Get:

$\text{distance} \approx a \times R_{⊕} \approx 1.9223 \times 6371 \text{ km} \approx 12250 \text{ km}$


Final_answer:  $\boxed{\text{distance} \approx 12250 \text{ km}}$",$\text{distance} \approx 12250 \text{ km}$,Yes,"To calculate the geodesic distance (great-circle distance) between two points on the Earth, assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere, we can use the spherical law of cosines formula.

The formula is:
`d = R * arccos(sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ))`
where:
*   `d` is the geodesic distance.
*   `R` is the radius of the Earth (we'll use the average radius, approximately 6371 km).
*   `φ1`, `φ2` are the latitudes of the two points in radians.
*   `Δλ` is the absolute difference in longitudes (`|λ2 - λ1|`) in radians.

**Step 1: Convert coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD).**
For latitudes, North is positive, South is negative. For longitudes, East is positive, West is negative.
`DD = Degrees + Minutes/60 + Seconds/3600`

**Boston (BOS):**

**Step 2: Convert Decimal Degrees to Radians.**
`Radians = Degrees * (π / 180)` (using `π ≈ 3.14159265359`)

*   `φ1_rad = 42.36027778 * (π / 180) = 0.73932709 radians`

**Step 4: Apply the spherical law of cosines formula to find the angular distance.**
Let `c` be the angular distance.
`cos(c) = sin(φ1_rad) * sin(φ2_rad) + cos(φ1_rad) * cos(φ2_rad) * cos(Δλ)`

*   `sin(φ1_rad) = sin(0.73932709) = 0.67389814`

`cos(c) = 0.21989632 + (0.69830472 * -0.80917688)`
`cos(c) = 0.21989632 - 0.56501104`
`cos(c) = -0.34511472`

Now find `c`:
`c = arccos(-0.34511472) = 1.92131030 radians`

We use the Earth's average radius `R = 6371 km`.
`d = R * c`
`d = 6371 km * 1.92131030`
`d = 12242.0617 km`

5,"<image>JSTL-Fig-5</image>As shown in the figure, let's assume that on an expedition mission to Mars, we take a telescope with 0.01 arcsecond angular resolution from earth. What is the ratio of the number of the stars we can measure the parallax distance to using this telescope on Mars compared to earth? The semimajor axis of Mars is 1.524 AU.","Step1: According to the figure below,

for a given small $\theta$ we can have:

$\tan(\theta) \approx \theta \approx \frac{r}{d} \rightarrow \theta = \text{const.} = \frac{r_e}{d_e} = \frac{r_m}{d_m}$

$\frac{d_m}{d_e} = \frac{r_m}{r_e}$

Let N be the number of observed stars:

Get:

$N \propto d^3 \rightarrow \frac{N_m}{N_e} = \left(\frac{d_m}{d_e}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1.5}{1}\right)^3 \approx 4$

Final_answer:  $\boxed{N \approx 4}$",$N \approx 4$,Yes,"To solve this problem, we need to understand how stellar parallax works and how it relates to the baseline of observation and the angular resolution of the telescope.

1.  **Understanding Parallax Distance Measurement:**
    The distance `D` to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax angle `p`. The standard formula is `D = 1/p`, where `D` is in parsecs (pc) and `p` is in arcseconds (arcsec). This formula is based on a baseline of 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) (the average distance from Earth to the Sun). More generally, `D = B / p`, where `B` is the semi-baseline in AU and `D` is in parsecs.

2.  **Angular Resolution and Maximum Measurable Distance:**
    The telescope has an angular resolution of 0.01 arcseconds. This means that any star with a parallax angle smaller than 0.01 arcseconds cannot be reliably measured. Therefore, the minimum measurable parallax angle (`p_min`) is 0.01 arcsec.
    The maximum distance to which we can measure parallax (`D_max`) is achieved when the parallax angle is at its minimum measurable value: `D_max = B / p_min`.

3.  **Maximum Distance from Earth:**
    *   The semi-baseline for parallax measurements from Earth is 1 AU.
    *   `D_max_earth = 1 AU / 0.01 arcsec = 100 parsecs`.

4.  **Maximum Distance from Mars:**
    *   The semi-major axis of Mars' orbit is 1.524 AU. This will be the semi-baseline for parallax measurements from Mars.
    *   `D_max_mars = 1.524 AU / 0.01 arcsec = 152.4 parsecs`.

5.  **Number of Stars and Volume:**
    Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars we can measure the parallax distance to is proportional to the volume of space probed. The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3) * π * R^3`, where `R` is the maximum distance we can measure.
    So, the number of stars `N` is proportional to `D_max^3`.

6.  **Ratio of Number of Stars:**
    We want to find the ratio of the number of stars measurable from Mars to the number of stars measurable from Earth:
    `Ratio = N_mars / N_earth`

    Since `N` is proportional to `D_max^3`:
    `Ratio = (D_max_mars)^3 / (D_max_earth)^3 = (D_max_mars / D_max_earth)^3`

    Substitute the calculated maximum distances:
    `Ratio = (152.4 parsecs / 100 parsecs)^3`
    `Ratio = (1.524)^3`

7.  **Calculation:**
    `(1.524)^3 = 1.524 * 1.524 * 1.524 ≈ 3.541`

Get:

$\frac{\Delta t}{T} = \frac{2 * \frac{acb}{2} + \frac{\pi ab}{2}}{\pi ab}$

$\frac{\Delta t}{T} = \frac{aeb + \frac{\pi ab}{2}}{\pi ab}$

$\frac{\Delta t}{T} = \frac{e}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}$

$\Delta t = \left(\frac{e}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}\right) * T$

Note: In the calculations, the semi-major axis was denoted by $a$ and the semi-minor axis was denoted by $b$.

Final_answer:  $\boxed{\Delta t = \left(\frac{e}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}\right) * T}$",$\Delta t = \left(\frac{e}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}\right) * T$,Yes,"The problem asks us to find the time it takes for a comet to travel from point A to point B along an elliptical orbit around a star, given the period of the comet (T) and the eccentricity of the orbit (e). The orbit is counterclockwise.

1.  **Understand the Geometry and Setup:**
    *   The orbit is an ellipse, with the star at one focus. Let's place the center of the ellipse at the origin (0,0).
    *   The horizontal line is the major axis, and the vertical line passing through A and B is the minor axis.
    *   The star is at the left focus, so its coordinates are F(-c, 0), where c = ae and 'a' is the semi-major axis, 'e' is the eccentricity.
    *   Points A and B are the endpoints of the minor axis. So, their coordinates are A(0, -b) and B(0, b), where 'b' is the semi-minor axis.
    *   The relationship between a, b, and e is b = a * sqrt(1 - e^2).

2.  **Kepler's Second Law:**
    Kepler's Second Law states that a line joining a planet and the Sun (or in this case, a comet and a star) sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This implies that the rate of area sweeping is constant: dA/dt = A_total / T.
    The total area of the ellipse is A_total = pi * a * b.
    So, the time taken to sweep a certain area (Area_swept) is given by:
    t = (Area_swept / A_total) * T.

3.  **Relating Eccentric Anomaly to Area Swept:**
    We need to calculate the area swept by the radius vector from the star (focus F) as the comet moves from A to B.
    Let's use the eccentric anomaly (E) to parameterize the ellipse. A standard parametrization for an ellipse centered at the origin is x = a cos E and y = b sin E.
    The star is at the left focus (-ae, 0).
    *   For point B(0, b): x = 0 => a cos E_B = 0. Since y = b > 0, we must have b sin E_B = b => sin E_B = 1. Therefore, E_B = pi/2.
    *   For point A(0, -b): x = 0 => a cos E_A = 0. Since y = -b < 0, we must have b sin E_A = -b => sin E_A = -1. Therefore, E_A = 3pi/2.

    The mean anomaly (M) is defined such that it is proportional to the time elapsed and the area swept. It's often given by M = E - e sin E. This formula for M implies that E=0 corresponds to the *apocenter* if the star is at the left focus (-ae, 0) and E=pi corresponds to the *pericenter* (closest point, at (-a, 0)). If the star was at (+ae, 0), then E=0 would be the pericenter.

    Given that the star is at the left focus (-ae, 0):
    *   E=0 corresponds to the apocenter (a, 0).
    *   E=pi corresponds to the pericenter (-a, 0).
    *   E=pi/2 corresponds to B(0, b).
    *   E=3pi/2 corresponds to A(0, -b).

    The comet moves from A to B in a counterclockwise direction. This means the eccentric anomaly E goes from E_A = 3pi/2 to E_B = pi/2.
    To move counterclockwise from 3pi/2 to pi/2, the comet must pass through E=2pi (which is equivalent to E=0, the apocenter) and then continue to pi/2.
    So, the effective range of E is from 3pi/2 to (2pi + pi/2) = 5pi/2.

    The area swept by the radius vector from the focus is proportional to the change in mean anomaly. The mean anomaly M(E) from the apocenter (E=0) is M(E) = E - e sin E.
    The total change in mean anomaly for one full period T is 2pi.
    So, the time t = (M_final - M_initial) / (2pi) * T.

    Let's calculate the mean anomaly at the start and end points of the path:
    *   Initial point: A, corresponding to E_initial = 3pi/2.
        M_initial = M(3pi/2) = 3pi/2 - e sin(3pi/2) = 3pi/2 - e(-1) = 3pi/2 + e.
    *   Final point: B, corresponding to E_final = 5pi/2. (This is E_B + 2pi to account for the full path).
        M_final = M(5pi/2) = 5pi/2 - e sin(5pi/2) = 5pi/2 - e(1) = 5pi/2 - e.

    Now, calculate the change in mean anomaly:
    Delta M = M_final - M_initial = (5pi/2 - e) - (3pi/2 + e)
    Delta M = (5pi/2 - 3pi/2) - (e + e)
    Delta M = (2pi/2) - 2e
    Delta M = pi - 2e.

4.  **Calculate the Time:**
    Substitute Delta M into the time formula:
    t_AB = (Delta M / (2pi)) * T
    t_AB = ((pi - 2e) / (2pi)) * T
    t_AB = (pi / (2pi) - 2e / (2pi)) * T
    t_AB = (1/2 - e/pi) * T.

5.  **Consistency Check:**
    *   If e=0 (a circular orbit), then t_AB = (1/2 - 0/pi) * T = T/2. This makes sense: A and B are on the minor axis, and for a circular orbit, the star is at the center. Moving from A to B (half the circle) takes half the period.
    *   If we calculate the time for the other half of the orbit (from B to A, counterclockwise), E goes from pi/2 to 3pi/2.
        M_initial = M(pi/2) = pi/2 - e sin(pi/2) = pi/2 - e.
        M_final = M(3pi/2) = 3pi/2 - e sin(3pi/2) = 3pi/2 + e.
        Delta M_BA = (3pi/2 + e) - (pi/2 - e) = pi + 2e.
        t_BA = ((pi + 2e) / (2pi)) * T = (1/2 + e/pi) * T.
    *   The sum of times for a full orbit: t_AB + t_BA = (1/2 - e/pi) * T + (1/2 + e/pi) * T = T. This confirms the calculation is consistent.

The final answer is $\boxed{\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{e}{\pi}\right)T}$.",0.735
7,"An astronomer observes an eclipsing binary star system from Earth, and he plots the following light curve. <image>JSTL-Fig-7</image>As shown in the figure, suppose that both stars have circular orbits and the distance between the stars is 14.8 AU. What is the total mass of the binary star system in terms of solar masses?","Step1: The time difference between the primary and secondary eclipses is 4.2 years. These eclipses when one star covers the other. Thus, we observe that the period of orbit is twice this, or 8.4 years. The semimajor axis is 14.8 AU, so by Kepler's Third Law.

Get:

$T^{2}=\frac{a^{3}}{M} \Longrightarrow M=\frac{a^{3}}{T^{2}}=\frac{14.8^{3}}{8.4^{2}}=46 M_{\odot}$

Final_answer:  $\boxed{46 M_{\odot}}$",$46 M_{\odot}$,Yes,"To determine the total mass of the binary star system, we will use Kepler's Third Law for binary systems, which states:
$(M_1 + M_2) P^2 = a^3$
where:
*   $M_1 + M_2$ is the total mass of the system.
*   $P$ is the orbital period.
*   $a$ is the semi-major axis (distance between the stars for circular orbits).

When the total mass $(M_1 + M_2)$ is expressed in solar masses ($M_{\odot}$), the period ($P$) in Earth years (yr), and the semi-major axis ($a$) in Astronomical Units (AU), the equation simplifies to:
$M_{total} = \frac{a^3}{P^2}$

First, we need to extract the necessary values from the provided information:
1.  **Distance between the stars ($a$):** The problem states $a = 14.8$ AU.
2.  **Orbital Period ($P$):** We need to determine this from the light curve.
    *   The light curve shows apparent magnitude versus year. A lower magnitude means the star system is brighter, and a higher magnitude means it's dimmer.
    *   Eclipsing binary systems show periodic dips in brightness (increases in apparent magnitude) when one star passes in front of the other. The deepest dip is usually the primary eclipse, and a shallower dip is the secondary eclipse.
    *   Observing the graph:
        *   There is a deep primary eclipse where the apparent magnitude drops from about 6.0 to 7.5. This minimum appears to be centered around late 2014, specifically around 2014.75 (roughly three-quarters of the way between 2014 and 2015).
        *   There is a shallower secondary eclipse where the apparent magnitude drops from about 6.0 to 6.2. This minimum appears to be centered around late 2018, specifically around 2018.75 (roughly three-quarters of the way between 2018 and 2019).
    *   For circular orbits, the secondary eclipse occurs exactly halfway through the orbital period after the primary eclipse. Therefore, the time difference between the primary and secondary eclipse minima is $P/2$.
    *   $P/2 = 2018.75 \text{ yr} - 2014.75 \text{ yr} = 4.00 \text{ yr}$
    *   So, the full orbital period $P = 2 \times 4.00 \text{ yr} = 8.00 \text{ yr}$.

Now, we can plug these values into Kepler's Third Law:
$M_{total} = \frac{(14.8 \text{ AU})^3}{(8.00 \text{ yr})^2}$
$M_{total} = \frac{14.8 \times 14.8 \times 14.8}{8.00 \times 8.00}$
$M_{total} = \frac{3241.792}{64}$
$M_{total} \approx 50.653$

Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the given distance 14.8 AU), the total mass is $50.7 M_{\odot}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{50.7 solar masses}}$.",0.735
8,"A certain artificial Earth satellite moves around the Earth in a circular orbit lying in the Earth's equatorial plane.  An observer in Tehran, at latitude $\phi = 35.6^{\circ}$, sees the satellite cross the local meridian (culmination) with a zenith distance of $z = 46.0^{\circ}$. Please calculate the geocentric distance of the satellite (in units of the Earth's radius).

$\delta = 180^{\circ} - \varphi - \angle EOS = 10.4^{\circ}$.

Get:

In triangle EOS:  

$\begin{aligned}\frac{R_s}{\sin\angle EOS}=\frac{R}{\sin\delta}\Rightarrow\frac{R_s}{R}=3.98\end{aligned}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{3.98}$",$3.98$,Yes,"The problem asks us to calculate the geocentric distance of a satellite ($R_s$) in units of the Earth's radius ($R$). We are given the observer's latitude ($\phi$) and the satellite's zenith distance ($z$) at culmination. The satellite is in a circular orbit in the Earth's equatorial plane.

Let's analyze the geometry based on the provided diagram and standard astronomical principles:
1.  **C** is the center of the Earth.
2.  **O** is the observer's location on the Earth's surface. The distance CO is the Earth's radius, **R**.
3.  **S** is the satellite's position. The distance CS is the satellite's geocentric distance, **R_s**.
4.  The observer is at latitude $\phi = 35.6^{\circ}$ in Tehran (Northern Hemisphere).
5.  The satellite is in the equatorial plane. When the satellite culminates, it means it is on the observer's local meridian. Since the observer is in the Northern Hemisphere and the satellite is on the equator, the satellite will be observed to the South of the observer's zenith.
6.  The angle at the center of the Earth between the observer's radius vector (CO) and the satellite's radius vector (CS) is the observer's latitude, so $\angle OCS = \phi$.
7.  The zenith distance $z = 46.0^{\circ}$ is the observed angle between the local zenith direction (extension of CO outwards from O) and the line of sight to the satellite (OS).
8.  The angle $\delta$ in the diagram, $\angle CSO$, is the parallax angle ($p$).

Now, we use the Law of Sines in the triangle **COS**:
$\frac{R_s}{\sin(\angle COS)} = \frac{R}{\sin(\angle CSO)}$

From the diagram, the angle $\angle COS$ is usually taken as $z$ (the observed zenith distance). However, this direct interpretation leads to a physically impossible result ($R_s < R$), as shown in the thought process. The key lies in the relationship between the observed zenith distance ($z$), the geocentric zenith distance ($z_0$), and the parallax angle ($\delta$).

The geocentric zenith distance $z_0$ for a satellite on the equator observed from latitude $\phi$ is simply $\phi$.
Parallax causes the apparent position of a nearby object to shift towards the horizon, meaning the observed zenith distance $z$ is *greater* than the geocentric zenith distance $z_0$.
So, the relationship is $z = z_0 + \delta$.
Substituting $z_0 = \phi$, we get:
$z = \phi + \delta$
This implies $\delta = z - \phi$.

Now, let's substitute this value of $\delta$ and the angle $\angle COS$ into the Law of Sines. The angle $\angle COS$ is the angle between the radius to the observer (CO) and the line of sight (OS). If $z$ is the zenith distance (angle from the extended radius outwards to OS), then for $z < 90^\circ$, the internal angle $\angle COS$ is $180^\circ - z$. However, the diagram shows $z$ as an acute angle between the *extended* radius (zenith) and the line of sight, implying $\angle COS = z$. This is the common point of confusion.

To resolve this and make the parallax relation $z = \phi + \delta$ consistent with the triangle's angle sum, it must be that the internal angle at O, $\angle COS$, is $180^\circ - z$. (If $z$ is the angle to the zenith, then $180^\circ - z$ is the angle to the nadir, which is the internal angle for a direct line to the center C).
If $\angle COS = 180^\circ - z$, then the sum of angles in $\triangle COS$ is:
$\angle OCS + \angle COS + \angle CSO = 180^\circ$
$\phi + (180^\circ - z) + \delta = 180^\circ$
$\phi - z + \delta = 0$
$\delta = z - \phi$
This matches the parallax relationship derived earlier.

Now, apply the Law of Sines:
$\frac{R_s}{\sin(\angle COS)} = \frac{R}{\sin(\angle CSO)}$
$\frac{R_s}{\sin(180^\circ - z)} = \frac{R}{\sin\delta}$
Since $\sin(180^\circ - z) = \sin z$:
$\frac{R_s}{\sin z} = \frac{R}{\sin\delta}$
Substituting $\delta = z - \phi$:
$\frac{R_s}{R} = \frac{\sin z}{\sin(z - \phi)}$

Now, we plug in the given values:
$\phi = 35.6^{\circ}$
$z = 46.0^{\circ}$

First, calculate the difference in angles:
$z - \phi = 46.0^{\circ} - 35.6^{\circ} = 10.4^{\circ}$

Next, calculate the sine values:
$\sin(z) = \sin(46.0^{\circ}) \approx 0.7193398$
$\sin(z - \phi) = \sin(10.4^{\circ}) \approx 0.1805358$

Finally, calculate the ratio $R_s/R$:
$\frac{R_s}{R} = \frac{0.7193398}{0.1805358} \approx 3.98413$

The geocentric distance of the satellite is approximately 3.98 times the Earth's radius.

The final answer is $\boxed{3.98}$",0.525
9,"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

10,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$ kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

$P=\frac{2\pi}{\Omega_0}=224\:\mathrm{Myr}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{224Myr}$",$224Myr$,Yes,"The problem asks us to estimate the Sun's orbital period (P) around the Galactic Centre (GC) using the provided graph and formulas for line-of-sight ($V_r$) and transverse ($V_t$) velocities.

The given formulas are:
1.  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
2.  $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

We are given:
*   $R_0 = 8.5$ kpc (Sun's distance from GC)
*   $D = 100$ pc $= 0.1$ kpc (distance of stars from Sun)
*   The graph shows $V_r$ (solid red curve) and $V_t$ (dashed blue curve) as a function of Galactic longitude $l$.

We need to find $\Omega_0$ (Sun's angular velocity) to calculate the period $P = 2\pi / \Omega_0$.

**Step 1: Extract information from the $V_r$ curve (solid red).**
The $V_r$ curve is clearly a sine wave. From the graph, its amplitude is $1.5$ km/s (it goes from $0$ to $1.5$ at $l=90^\circ$ and to $-1.5$ at $l=270^\circ$).
Comparing this to the formula $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, we can equate the amplitude:
$(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$ (Equation A)

**Step 2: Extract information from the $V_t$ curve (dashed blue).**
The $V_t$ curve shows an oscillating component superimposed on a constant offset. The formula for $V_t$ is $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$.
The term $(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l$ is an oscillating component. When averaged over a full $360^\circ$ range of $l$, $\cos l$ averages to zero. Therefore, the average value of $V_t$ over $l$ should be equal to the constant term $-\Omega D$.

Let's find the average value of $V_t$ from the graph. The curve oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value.
From the graph:
*   Maximum $V_t \approx -0.25$ km/s (at $l=180^\circ$)
*   Minimum $V_t \approx -2.75$ km/s (at $l=0^\circ, 90^\circ, 270^\circ$)
The average value is $\frac{V_{t,max} + V_{t,min}}{2} = \frac{-0.25 + (-2.75)}{2} = \frac{-3.0}{2} = -1.5 \text{ km/s}$.

Equating this average to the constant term in the formula:
$-\Omega D = -1.5 \text{ km/s}$
$\Omega D = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$ (Equation B)

*(Note: There is an inconsistency between the shape of the blue curve and the functional form $C \cos l - \Omega D$. However, to solve the problem, we rely on the direct extraction of the amplitude for $V_r$ and the average value for $V_t$, as these are the most robust interpretations of the graph's parameters given the formulas.)*

**Step 3: Calculate $\Omega$ (angular velocity of the stars/cloud).**
From Equation B: $\Omega D = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$.
Given $D = 0.1$ kpc:
$\Omega = \frac{1.5 \text{ km/s}}{0.1 \text{ kpc}} = 15 \text{ km/s/kpc}$.

**Step 4: Calculate $\Omega_0$ (angular velocity of the Sun).**
Substitute the value of $\Omega$ into Equation A:
$(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$
$(15 \text{ km/s/kpc} - \Omega_{0}) \times 8.5 \text{ kpc} = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$
$127.5 \text{ km/s} - 8.5 \text{ kpc} \cdot \Omega_{0} = 1.5 \text{ km/s}$
$8.5 \text{ kpc} \cdot \Omega_{0} = 127.5 - 1.5 = 126 \text{ km/s}$
$\Omega_{0} = \frac{126 \text{ km/s}}{8.5 \text{ kpc}} \approx 14.8235 \text{ km/s/kpc}$.

**Step 5: Calculate the Sun's orbital period (P) around the GC.**
The period $P = 2\pi / \Omega_0$. First, convert $\Omega_0$ to units of $s^{-1}$.
Use the conversion $1 \text{ kpc} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \text{ km}$.
$\Omega_{0} = 14.8235 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{kpc}} \times \frac{1 \text{ kpc}}{3.086 \times 10^{16} \text{ km}} \approx 4.8034 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

Now calculate $P$:
$P = \frac{2\pi}{4.8034 \times 10^{-16} \text{ s}^{-1}} \approx 1.3079 \times 10^{16} \text{ s}$.

Finally, convert the period to Mega-years (Myr).
Use the conversion $1 \text{ year} = 3.1536 \times 10^7 \text{ s}$.
$1 \text{ Myr} = 10^6 \text{ years} = 10^6 \times 3.1536 \times 10^7 \text{ s} = 3.1536 \times 10^{13} \text{ s}$.
$P \text{ (Myr)} = \frac{1.3079 \times 10^{16} \text{ s}}{3.1536 \times 10^{13} \text{ s/Myr}} \approx 414.7 \text{ Myr}$.

Rounding to three significant figures, $P \approx 415 \text{ Myr}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{415 Myr}}$",0.84
11,"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star. This wind-fed accretion is especially significant in systems that include an early-type star (such as an O or B star, indicated henceforth as an OB star), alongside a compact object like a neutron star (NS) in a close orbit. Consider such a NS-OB star binary system where a neutron star of mass $M_{\mathrm{NS}}=2.0\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and radius $R_\mathrm{NS}=11$ km is orbiting in a circular orbit of radius $a$ around the centre of the OB star with velocity $v_\mathrm{orb}=1.5\times10^{5}ms^{-1}$ (<image>JSTL-Fig-11</image>as shown in the figure). Throughout this problem the mass loss from the OB star is assumed to be spherically symmetric and its rate is $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{OB}}=1.0\times10^{-4} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.

The accretion radius, $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the maximum distance from the NS at which the stellar wind can be captured by the NS. If the stellar wind speed at the orbital distance of the NS is $v_\mathrm{w}=3.0\times10^6m s^{-1}$, find $R_\mathrm{acc}$ for the above system in km using standard escape velocity calculations.","Step1: The accretion radius can be estimated by equating the gravitational potential energy of the stellar wind to its kinetic energy

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\mathrm{w}} v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = \frac{G M_{\mathrm{NS}} \rho_{\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\mathrm{acc}}}\Longrightarrow \quad R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2}}$

where, $\rho_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the wind density and $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity of the wind.

Get:

For the case considered above $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} = v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} + v_{\mathrm{orb}}^{2}$

Step2: Here, $v_{\mathrm{w}} \gg v_{\mathrm{orb}}$, therefore, $v_{\mathrm{rel}}^{2} \approx v_{\mathrm{w}}^{2} = 9 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{m}^{2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$.

Get:

which gives, $R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 2.0 \times 1.988 \times 10^{30}}{9 \times 10^{12}} \, \mathrm{m}= 5.9 \times 10^{4} \, \mathrm{km}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{5.9 \times 10^{4} \, \mathrm{km}}$","$5.9 \times 10^{4} \, \mathrm{km}$",Yes,"To find the accretion radius ($R_{\mathrm{acc}}$) for the neutron star, we use the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion radius formula, which is derived from standard escape velocity considerations. The formula is:

$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2}$

Where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant.
- $M_{\mathrm{NS}}$ is the mass of the neutron star.
- $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relative velocity between the neutron star and the stellar wind.

First, let's list the given values:
- Mass of the neutron star, $M_{\mathrm{NS}} = 2.0 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$
- Orbital velocity of the neutron star, $v_{\mathrm{orb}} = 1.5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{m s}^{-1}$
- Stellar wind speed, $v_{\mathrm{w}} = 3.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{m s}^{-1}$

We also need the standard physical constants:
- Gravitational constant, $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{N m}^2 \mathrm{kg}^{-2}$
- Solar mass, $M_{\odot} = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \mathrm{kg}$

Step 1: Convert the neutron star mass to kilograms.
$M_{\mathrm{NS}} = 2.0 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} = 2.0 \times (1.989 \times 10^{30} \mathrm{kg}) = 3.978 \times 10^{30} \mathrm{kg}$

Step 2: Calculate the relative velocity ($v_{\mathrm{rel}}$).
The diagram shows that the orbital velocity ($v_{\mathrm{orb}}$) of the NS is tangential to its orbit, and the stellar wind velocity ($v_{\mathrm{w}}$) is radial from the OB star. Assuming these two velocities are perpendicular at the point of interest (as is standard for this type of problem and indicated by the diagram), the relative velocity squared can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
$v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2 = v_{\mathrm{orb}}^2 + v_{\mathrm{w}}^2$
$v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2 = (1.5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{m s}^{-1})^2 + (3.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{m s}^{-1})^2$
$v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2 = (2.25 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2}) + (9.0 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2})$
To add these, make the exponents the same:
$v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2 = (0.0225 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2}) + (9.0 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2})$
$v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2 = 9.0225 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2}$

Step 3: Calculate the accretion radius ($R_{\mathrm{acc}}$).
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 G M_{\mathrm{NS}}}{v_{\mathrm{rel}}^2}$
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 \times (6.674 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{N m}^2 \mathrm{kg}^{-2}) \times (3.978 \times 10^{30} \mathrm{kg})}{9.0225 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-2}}$
The units $\mathrm{N m}^2 \mathrm{kg}^{-2}$ are equivalent to $\mathrm{m}^3 \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \mathrm{s}^{-2}$.
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 3.978 \times 10^{30}}{9.0225 \times 10^{12}} \mathrm{m}$
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = \frac{5.3090664 \times 10^{20}}{9.0225 \times 10^{12}} \mathrm{m}$
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = 0.5884218 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{m}$
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = 5.884218 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{m}$

Step 4: Convert $R_{\mathrm{acc}}$ to kilometers.
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = 5.884218 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{m} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{km}}{1000 \mathrm{m}}$
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} = 5.884218 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{km}$

Step 5: Round the result to an appropriate number of significant figures.
The input values ($M_{\mathrm{NS}}$, $v_{\mathrm{orb}}$, $v_{\mathrm{w}}$) are given with 2 significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should also be rounded to 2 significant figures.
$R_{\mathrm{acc}} \approx 5.9 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{km}$

12,"<image>JSTL-Fig-12</image>As shown in the figure, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has released an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87 galaxy. To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. A face-on view sketch is shown in the right panel of the figure below (figure is not to scale).

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

where $r\in(R_{\mathrm{SC}},\infty)$ is the radial coordinate, $\phi\in[0,2\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle, and $E$ and $L$ are constants related to the conserved energy and conserved angular momentum, respectively. Here $v_\mathrm{r}\equiv dr/dt$ is the magnitude of the radial velocity, $v_\phi$ is the magnitude of the tangential velocity, and $\omega\equiv d\phi/dt$ is the angular velocity. We define the impact parameter $b$ for a trajectory as $b=L/\sqrt{2E}.$ Time dilation is neglected in this problem. Another useful equation is obtained by differentiating the first equation: $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

Circular light trajectories can exist around the black hole. Find the radius, $r_{\rm ph}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\rm ph}$, for such photon trajectories in terms of $M$ and relevant constants.","Step1: Circular trajectories have $r = \mathrm{constant}$. Hence, the radial velocity $v_r = 0$ and rate of change of radial component of velocity $\frac{dv_r}{dt} = 0$. From the third equation, $\frac{dv_r}{dt} - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0,$

Get:

we get radius $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$ of circular orbits to be $r_{\mathrm{ph}} = 3GM/c^2$

Step2: Then from the first equation, the impact parameter is found to be $b_{\mathrm{ph}} = L/\sqrt{2E} = 3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$ .

Get:

$b_{\mathrm{ph}}= 3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$

Final_answer: $\boxed{r_{\mathrm{ph}} = 3GM/c^2,b_{\mathrm{ph}}= 3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2}$","$r_{\mathrm{ph}} = 3GM/c^2,b_{\mathrm{ph}}= 3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$",Yes,"To find the radius, $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$, and impact parameter, $b_{\mathrm{ph}}$, for circular light trajectories, we need to apply the conditions for such orbits to the given equations. For a circular trajectory, the radial velocity $v_{\mathrm{r}}$ must be zero, and the radial acceleration $dv_{\mathrm{r}}/dt$ must also be zero.

The given equations are:
1. $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E$
2. $v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$
3. $\frac{dv_\mathrm{r}}{dt}-\frac{L^2}{r^3}+\frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4}=0$

**Step 1: Find the radius of the photon sphere, $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$.**
For a circular trajectory, $v_{\mathrm{r}}=0$ and $dv_{\mathrm{r}}/dt=0$.
Applying $dv_{\mathrm{r}}/dt=0$ to equation (3):
$0 - \frac{L^2}{r^3} + \frac{3GML^2}{c^2r^4} = 0$

Since $L \neq 0$ (light has angular momentum for an orbit) and $r \neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $\frac{L^2}{r^4}$:
$-r + \frac{3GM}{c^2} = 0$
$r = \frac{3GM}{c^2}$

This is the radius of the photon sphere, $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$.
So, $r_{\mathrm{ph}} = \frac{3GM}{c^2}$.

**Step 2: Find the impact parameter, $b_{\mathrm{ph}}$.**
The impact parameter is defined as $b = L/\sqrt{2E}$. We need to express $E$ in terms of $L$, $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$, $M$, and constants using equation (1) with $v_{\mathrm{r}}=0$.

From equation (1) with $v_{\mathrm{r}}=0$:
$\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E$

Substitute $r = r_{\mathrm{ph}} = \frac{3GM}{c^2}$ into this equation:
First, evaluate the term in the parenthesis:
$1 - \frac{2GM}{c^{2}r_{\mathrm{ph}}} = 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^{2}\left(\frac{3GM}{c^2}\right)} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$

Now substitute this back into the expression for $E$:
$E = \frac{L^2}{2r_{\mathrm{ph}}^2} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{L^2}{6r_{\mathrm{ph}}^2}$

Now substitute this expression for $E$ into the definition of $b$:
$b_{\mathrm{ph}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{2E}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{L^2}{6r_{\mathrm{ph}}^2}}}$
$b_{\mathrm{ph}} = \frac{L}{\sqrt{\frac{L^2}{3r_{\mathrm{ph}}^2}}} = \frac{L}{\frac{L}{\sqrt{3}r_{\mathrm{ph}}}}$
$b_{\mathrm{ph}} = \sqrt{3}r_{\mathrm{ph}}$

Finally, substitute the value of $r_{\mathrm{ph}}$ back into the expression for $b_{\mathrm{ph}}$:

13,"An astrophysical survey mapped all the galaxies in a small region of the sky, of angular diameter $\Delta\theta=0.01$ rad, where many galaxies seemed to be concentrated around the central area of the image. When the positions and redshifts of all the galaxies in this cluster were measured, an interesting distribution emerged. As shown in the figure. <image>JSTL-Fig-13</image>

Using these observations, estimate the total mass of the galaxy cluster and express your answer in solar masses. Assume that this galaxy cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, with a root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_{z}=\sqrt{\langle(z-0.7)^{2}\rangle}=0.0005$. Feel free to make reasonable approximations when considering the average velocities, masses, and spatial distribution of the galaxies. Consider that the distance to $\bar{z}=0.7$ in the standard cosmological model is $D_{A}=1500$ Mpc. Ignore cosmological effects on the distance.","Step1: If $U$ and $K$ are the total gravitational potential energy and the total kinetic energy of the cluster, respectively, the virial theorem says that: $U+2K=0$

Let's say that there are $N$ galaxies of masses $m_i$, where $i=1,...,N$,moving with velocities $\vec{u}_i=\vec{v}_i-\vec{v}_0$ with respect to the cluster, where $\vec v_0$ is the velocity of the cluster as a whole Therefore, in the cluster frame, $K$ is given by $K=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}m_iu_i^2$

As an estimation, consider that all galaxies have mass equal to the average mass $\langle m\rangle=$

$M_T/N:$ $K=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{M_T}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nu_i^2=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\dfrac{\sum u_i^2}{N}=\dfrac{1}{2}M_T\sigma_v^2$

Where $\sigma_v=\sqrt{\langle u_i^2\rangle}$ is the root-mean-square galaxy speed, also known as velocity dispersion. Notice, however, that only the dispersion in redshift is given, which translates into a radial velocity dispersion: $\sigma_{v_{r}}=c\cdot\sigma_{z}=2.998\times10^{8}\:\mathrm{m/s}\times0.0005=1.499\times10^{5}\:\mathrm{m/s}$

There is no penalization for students who use that $\sigma_v=c\sigma_z.$ For completeness of the solution, however, we relate $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_{v_r}$ by assuming three-dimensional isotropy for velocities, which yields $\sigma_v^2=3\sigma_{v_r}^2$.

Get:

$K$ is then given by: $K=\frac{3}{2}M_T\sigma_{v_r}^2$

Step2: This can be estimated in different ways. Usually, the spatial distribution of the large numben of galaxies may be approximated as uniform, so that one estimates $U$ as the binding energy of a homogeneous spherical mass distribution, which is given by: $U=-\frac{3}{5}\frac{GM_T^2}{R}$

And, assuming the cluster is spherical, its radius is: $R=\frac{D_A\cdot\Delta\theta}{2}=\frac{1500\times10^6\times206265\times1.496\times10^{11}\times10^{-2}}{2}=2.3143\times10^{23}\:\mathrm{m}$

The virial mass ($M_{virial}$) for a galaxy cluster can be approximated by the formula:

$M_{virial} = \frac{5 R \sigma_v^2}{G}$

where:
*   $R$ is the characteristic radius of the cluster.
*   $\sigma_v$ is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of the galaxies within the cluster.
*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.

Let's break down the calculation into steps:

**1. Calculate the one-dimensional velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$):**
The problem provides the root-mean-square redshift dispersion $\sigma_z = 0.0005$.
The velocity dispersion can be calculated using the speed of light ($c$):
$c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \text{ km/s} = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$.
$\sigma_v = c \times \sigma_z$
$\sigma_v = (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times 0.0005 = 1.5 \times 10^5 \text{ m/s}$.

**2. Calculate the characteristic radius ($R$) of the cluster:**
The angular diameter of the observed region is $\Delta\theta = 0.01$ rad. Assuming this angular diameter represents the extent of the cluster, its angular radius is $\Delta\theta/2 = 0.005$ rad.
The angular diameter distance to the cluster at $\bar{z}=0.7$ is $D_A = 1500$ Mpc.
The physical radius $R$ is given by:
$R = D_A \times (\Delta\theta/2)$
$R = 1500 \text{ Mpc} \times 0.005 \text{ rad} = 7.5 \text{ Mpc}$.
To use this in the formula, we convert Megaparsecs (Mpc) to meters (m):
$1 \text{ Mpc} \approx 3.086 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}$.
$R = 7.5 \times (3.086 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}) = 2.3145 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}$.

**3. Apply the Virial Theorem to calculate the cluster mass ($M_{virial}$):**
The gravitational constant $G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3/(\text{kg s}^2)$.
Now, substitute the values into the virial mass formula:
$M_{virial} = \frac{5 \times (2.3145 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}) \times (1.5 \times 10^5 \text{ m/s})^2}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3/(\text{kg s}^2)}$
$M_{virial} = \frac{5 \times 2.3145 \times 10^{23} \times (2.25 \times 10^{10})}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}} \text{ kg}$
$M_{virial} = \frac{2.5925625 \times 10^{34}}{6.674 \times 10^{-11}} \text{ kg}$
$M_{virial} \approx 3.8847 \times 10^{44} \text{ kg}$.

**4. Convert the mass to solar masses:**
The mass of the Sun $M_\odot \approx 1.989 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}$.
$M_{virial} = \frac{3.8847 \times 10^{44} \text{ kg}}{1.989 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg/M}_\odot}$
$M_{virial} \approx 1.953 \times 10^{14} \text{ M}_\odot$.

Given the precision of the input values (e.g., $0.01$ rad, $0.0005$), rounding the result to two significant figures is appropriate.
$M_{virial} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{14} \text{ M}_\odot$.

The final answer is $\boxed{2.0 \times 10^{14} M_\odot}$.",1.092
14,"Observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background favour a flat (Euclidean) geometry, in which the total mass density (i.e.  density of matter and equivalent mass density of all forms of energy) should be equal to the so-called critical density: $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}\:=\:\frac{3\:H_{0}^{2}}{8\:\pi\:G}$,

where $H_{0}$ is the present value of the Hubble constant. However, the total density of matter (luminous and dark) is estimated at $\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}\:\approx\:2.8\cdot10^{-27}\:\mathrm{kg}\:\mathrm{m}^{-3}\:.$

To resolve this discrepancy, the standard cosmological model assumes that the Universe is filled with a mysterious ‘dark energy’ of constant energy density $E_\Lambda.$ Determine the value of $E_\Lambda$ and calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy. Neglect the contribution of electromagnetic radiation.

Get:

$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}=9.202 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

Step2: In flat geometry we have: $\rho_{m, 0}+\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{c^{2}}=\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$

Hence $E_{\Lambda}$ is given by: $E_{\Lambda}=\left[\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}-\rho_{m, 0}\right] c^{2} \approx 5.756 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

The linear scale of the Universe, $a$, is related to the cosmological redshift: $a(z)=a_{0} /(1+z)$

Get:

Thus, the matter density, $\rho_{m}$, increases with redshift: $\rho_{m}(z)=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3}$

Step3: We substitute the matter density, $\rho_{m}$ by the energy density, $E_{m}$, using the relationship $E=m c^{2}$

$E_{m}(z)=\rho_{m}(z) c^{2}=\rho_{m, 0}(1+z)^{3} c^{2}$

Get:

We finally get $z_{\mathrm{eq}}=\left[\frac{E_{\Lambda}}{\rho_{m, 0} c^{2}}\right]^{1 / 3}-1 \approx 0.32$

**Part 1: Determine the value of $E_\Lambda$**

For a flat (Euclidean) geometry, the total mass density ($\rho_{\mathrm{tot},0}$) must be equal to the critical density ($\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$). The total mass density is composed of matter density ($\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}$) and the equivalent mass density of dark energy ($\rho_{\Lambda,0}$).

So, $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}} = \rho_{\mathrm{m},0} + \rho_{\Lambda,0}$.
From this, we can find the equivalent mass density of dark energy: $\rho_{\Lambda,0} = \rho_{\mathrm{cr}} - \rho_{\mathrm{m},0}$.

First, let's calculate the critical density $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$ using the given formula and constants:
$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}\:=\:\frac{3\:H_{0}^{2}}{8\:\pi\:G}$

From the table of constants:
*   Hubble constant, $H_0 = 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$
*   Universal gravitational constant, $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2 \text{ kg}^{-2}$
*   Speed of light in vacuum, $c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$ (needed for $E_\Lambda$ conversion)
*   Current matter density, $\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}\:\approx\:2.8\cdot10^{-27}\:\mathrm{kg}\:\mathrm{m}^{-3}\:$

First, convert $H_0$ to SI units (s$^{-1}$):
$1 \text{ Mpc} = 10^6 \text{ pc}$
$1 \text{ pc} = 3.086 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}$
So, $1 \text{ Mpc} = 3.086 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}$.

$H_0 = 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1} = 70 \times 10^3 \text{ m s}^{-1} / (3.086 \times 10^{22} \text{ m})$
$H_0 = 2.268308... \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}$

Now, calculate $\rho_{\mathrm{cr}}$:
$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}} = \frac{3 \times (2.268308 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1})^2}{8 \times \pi \times (6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2 \text{ kg}^{-2})}$
$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}} = \frac{3 \times 5.145107 \times 10^{-36}}{8 \times 3.14159265 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11}}$
$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}} = \frac{15.435321 \times 10^{-36}}{167.662059 \times 10^{-11}}$
$\rho_{\mathrm{cr}} = 0.092063 \times 10^{-25} \text{ kg m}^{-3} = 9.2063 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$.

Next, calculate the equivalent mass density of dark energy $\rho_{\Lambda,0}$:
$\rho_{\Lambda,0} = \rho_{\mathrm{cr}} - \rho_{\mathrm{m},0}$
$\rho_{\Lambda,0} = (9.2063 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}) - (2.8 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3})$
$\rho_{\Lambda,0} = 6.4063 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$.

Finally, determine the energy density of dark energy $E_\Lambda$:
$E_\Lambda = \rho_{\Lambda,0} \times c^2$
$E_\Lambda = (6.4063 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}) \times (2.998 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1})^2$
$E_\Lambda = 6.4063 \times 10^{-27} \times 8.988004 \times 10^{16} \text{ J m}^{-3}$
$E_\Lambda = 57.5855 \times 10^{-11} \text{ J m}^{-3}$
$E_\Lambda \approx 5.76 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J m}^{-3}$ (rounded to three significant figures).

**Part 2: Calculate for which redshift in the past the energy density equivalent to matter was equal to the density of dark energy.**

The matter density evolves with redshift $z$ as $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}(z) = \rho_{\mathrm{m},0} (1+z)^3$.
The dark energy density $E_\Lambda$ is constant, which means its equivalent mass density $\rho_\Lambda = E_\Lambda/c^2 = \rho_{\Lambda,0}$ is also constant with redshift.

We want to find the redshift $z$ where the energy density equivalent to matter equals the density of dark energy:
$E_{\mathrm{m}}(z) = E_\Lambda$
This is equivalent to:
$\rho_{\mathrm{m}}(z) = \rho_{\Lambda,0}$

Substitute the expression for $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}(z)$:
$\rho_{\mathrm{m},0} (1+z)^3 = \rho_{\Lambda,0}$

Now, solve for $z$:
$(1+z)^3 = \frac{\rho_{\Lambda,0}}{\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}}$
$1+z = \left(\frac{\rho_{\Lambda,0}}{\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}}\right)^{1/3}$
$z = \left(\frac{\rho_{\Lambda,0}}{\rho_{\mathrm{m},0}}\right)^{1/3} - 1$

Using the values calculated and given:
$\rho_{\mathrm{m},0} = 2.8 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$
$\rho_{\Lambda,0} = 6.4063 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$

$z = \left(\frac{6.4063 \times 10^{-27}}{2.8 \times 10^{-27}}\right)^{1/3} - 1$
$z = \left(\frac{6.4063}{2.8}\right)^{1/3} - 1$
$z = (2.2880025)^{1/3} - 1$
$z = 1.31789 - 1$
$z \approx 0.318$ (rounded to three significant figures).

The final answer is $\boxed{E_\Lambda = 5.76 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J m}^{-3}, z = 0.318}$",1.092

where:
$λ_{max}$ is the peak wavelength of emission.
$b$ is Wien's displacement constant, approximately $2.898 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \cdot \text{K}$.
$T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

**1. Find the distance of the system from the Earth (in parsecs):**

The parallax ($p$) is given as 35.03 milliarcseconds (mas).
First, convert the parallax from milliarcseconds to arcseconds:
$p (\text{arcseconds}) = p (\text{milliarcseconds}) / 1000$
$p = 35.03 \text{ mas} / 1000 = 0.03503 \text{ arcseconds}$

The distance ($d$) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds:
$d = 1 / p$
$d = 1 / 0.03503$
$d \approx 28.5470 \text{ parsecs}$

Rounding to two decimal places, the distance is approximately $28.55 \text{ parsecs}$.

**2. Find the absolute visual magnitude ($M_V$) of the star:**

We are given the apparent visual magnitude ($m_V$) as 8.3.
We have calculated the distance ($d$) as approximately 28.5470 parsecs.

The relationship between apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and distance is given by the distance modulus formula:
$m_V - M_V = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5$

Rearranging to solve for $M_V$:
$M_V = m_V - (5 \log_{10}(d) - 5)$
$M_V = m_V + 5 - 5 \log_{10}(d)$

Substitute the known values:
$M_V = 8.3 + 5 - 5 \log_{10}(28.5470)$
$M_V = 13.3 - 5 \times \log_{10}(28.5470)$

Calculate $\log_{10}(28.5470)$:
$\log_{10}(28.5470) \approx 1.455552$

Now substitute this value back into the equation for $M_V$:
$M_V = 13.3 - 5 \times 1.455552$
$M_V = 13.3 - 7.27776$
$M_V \approx 6.02224$

The binary system is located 81.1 light years from Earth and has an orbital period of 3.96 days. The semi-major axis for Menkalinan B (smaller star) was measured to be 3.35 milliarcseconds. If the mass ratio of the two components is 1.026, find the total mass of the system (in solar masses).","Step1: Applying the 3<sup>rd</sup> Kepler's law, the total mass of the system is : $m_{A} > m_{B} \Rightarrow \alpha_{B} > \alpha_{A}$

$\frac{\alpha_{B}}{\alpha_{A}} = 1.026$

Get:

$\alpha = (\alpha_{A} + \alpha_{B})/2 = \frac{\alpha_{B}}{2}(1 + \frac{\alpha_{A}}{\alpha_{B}}) = 1.97 \frac{\alpha_{B}}{2}$

Step2: $M_{tot} = \frac{4\pi^{2}}{G} \times \frac{\left(0.00330^{""} \times \frac{1rad}{206265^{""}}\right)^{3} \cdot \left(81.1ly \cdot \frac{9.46 \cdot 10^{15}m}{1ly}\right)^{3}}{\left(3.96d \cdot \frac{86400s}{1d}\right)^{2}}$

Get:

$M_{tot} = 9.41 \cdot 10^{30}kg = 4.73M_{\odot}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{4.73M_{\odot}}$",$4.73M_{\odot}$,Yes,"The problem asks us to find the total mass of the Menkalinan binary system in solar masses using the provided astronomical data. We will use Kepler's Third Law for binary systems, which is simplified when using solar units (mass in solar masses, period in years, and semi-major axis in astronomical units).

**Given information:**
*   Orbital period (P) = 3.96 days
*   Distance to Earth (d) = 81.1 light-years (ly)
*   Angular semi-major axis of Menkalinan B (alpha_B) = 3.35 milliarcseconds (mas)
*   Mass ratio (q = M_A / M_B) = 1.026

**Step-by-step derivation:**

1.  **Convert the orbital period to years:**
    There are 365.25 days in a year.
    P (years) = P (days) / 365.25 = 3.96 / 365.25 = 0.0108429979 years.

2.  **Convert the distance to parsecs:**
    1 parsec (pc) = 3.26156 light-years (ly).
    d (pc) = d (ly) / 3.26156 = 81.1 / 3.26156 = 24.86518 pc.

3.  **Convert the angular semi-major axis of Menkalinan B to arcseconds:**
    1 milliarcsecond (mas) = 10^-3 arcseconds (arcsec).
    alpha_B (arcsec) = 3.35 mas * 10^-3 arcsec/mas = 0.00335 arcsec.

4.  **Calculate the linear semi-major axis of Menkalinan B (a_B) in Astronomical Units (AU):**
    For small angles, the linear semi-major axis (in AU) can be calculated by multiplying the angular semi-major axis (in arcseconds) by the distance (in parsecs).
    a_B (AU) = alpha_B (arcsec) * d (pc)
    a_B = 0.00335 arcsec * 24.86518 pc = 0.0833683 AU.

5.  **Calculate the total semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a_total) in AU:**
    For a binary system, the individual semi-major axes (a_A and a_B) relative to the center of mass are related to the total semi-major axis (a_total) by a_total = a_A + a_B.
    Also, from the definition of the center of mass, M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B.
    Given the mass ratio q = M_A / M_B, we have M_A = q * M_B.
    So, (q * M_B) * a_A = M_B * a_B, which simplifies to q * a_A = a_B, or a_A = a_B / q.
    Substitute a_A into the a_total equation:
    a_total = (a_B / q) + a_B = a_B * (1/q + 1) = a_B * ((1 + q) / q)
    a_total = 0.0833683 AU * ((1 + 1.026) / 1.026)
    a_total = 0.0833683 AU * (2.026 / 1.026)
    a_total = 0.0833683 AU * 1.97465887
    a_total = 0.164619 AU.

6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the total mass (M_total) in solar masses:**
    Kepler's Third Law for a binary system, when expressed in solar units (P in years, a in AU, and M in solar masses), is:
    M_total = a_total^3 / P_years^2
    M_total = (0.164619 AU)^3 / (0.0108429979 years)^2
    M_total = 0.00446059 / 0.000117511
    M_total = 37.958 M_solar.

Rounding to three significant figures, consistent with the input data (3.96 days, 81.1 light-years, 3.35 milliarcseconds).

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{38.0 solar masses}}$",1.092
18,"In the following problem the fluid mechanics of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS) is studied based on the velocity field data.<image>JSTL-Fig-18</image>As shown in the figure shows a map of relative velocity for GRS and the surrounding region. The arrows are oriented and scaled as per the directions and magnitudes of winds at different points.

Due to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, Jupiter is slightly flattened at its poles. The equation of a spheroid approximating for the shape of Jupiter can be stated as:$\begin{aligned}\frac{x^2+y^2}{R_e^2}+\frac{z^2}{R_p^2}=1,\end{aligned}$

where $R_{e}=7.15\times10^{7}$ m is the equatorial radius of Jupiter, and $R_{p}=6.69\times10^{7}$ m the polar radius. The radii of curvature of this spheroid in any direction can be calculated by the following equations $(\epsilon={\frac{R_{e}}{R_{p}}})$: 

$r(\phi)=R_{e}\left(1+\epsilon^{-2}\tan^{2}\phi\right)^{-1/2}$

$R(\phi)=R_{e}\epsilon^{-2}\left(\frac{r(\phi)}{R_{e}\cos\phi}\right)^{3}$

where $r$ and $R$ are the zonal (aka in the zone of a particular latitude) and meridional (aka longitudinal) radii of curvature, respectively, as a function of planetographic latitude $\phi.$ The sidereal rotation period of Jupiter is $P=3.57\times10^{4}$ s.

Calculate the zonal and meridional radii values ($\bar{r}$ and $\overline{R}$ respectively) at the location of the centre of the GRS.","Step1: From the figure,the centre of GRS lies at $\phi  =  - {20.0}^{ \circ  }$ .

$\epsilon  = \frac{{R}_{e}}{{R}_{p}} = \frac{7.15}{6.69}= {1.069}$

$\bar{r} = r\left( {-{20}^{ \circ  }}\right)  = {R}_{e}{\left( 1 + {\epsilon }^{-2}{\tan }^{2}\phi \right) }^{-1/2}= {7.15} \times  {10}^{7} \times  {\left( 1 + {\left( {1.0688}\right) }^{-2}{\tan }^{2}\left( -{20}^{ \circ  }\right) \right) }^{-1/2}$

Get:

$\bar{r} = {6.77} \times  {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m}$

Step2: $\bar{R} = R\left( {-{20}^{ \circ  }}\right)  = {R}_{e}{\epsilon }^{-2}{\left( \frac{r\left( \phi \right) }{{R}_{e}\cos \phi }\right) }^{3}= {7.15} \times  {10}^{7} \times  {\left( {1.0688}\right) }^{-2}{\left( \frac{r\left( {-{20}^{ \circ  }}\right) }{{7.15} \times  {10}^{7} \times  \cos \left( {-{20}^{ \circ  }}\right) }\right) }^{3}$

Get:

$\bar{R} = {6.40} \times  {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m}$

Final_answer: $\boxed{\bar{r} = {6.77} \times  {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m},\bar{R} = {6.40} \times  {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m}}$","$\bar{r} = {6.77} \times {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m},\bar{R} = {6.40} \times {10}^{7}\mathrm{\;m}$",Yes,"To calculate the zonal ($\bar{r}$) and meridional ($\overline{R}$) radii of curvature at the location of the center of the Great Red Spot (GRS), we need to follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the latitude of the GRS center from the provided image.**
    The image displays a map of relative velocity. The GRS is the large, elliptical vortex structure. By visually inspecting the center of this vortex, we can estimate its coordinates.
    -   The Latitude axis (horizontal) ranges from -26 to -16 degrees.
    -   The West Longitude axis (vertical) ranges from 10 to -15 degrees.
    The center of the GRS appears to be approximately at:
    -   Latitude: $\phi \approx -21^\circ$
    -   West Longitude: approximately $-2.5^\circ$ (though longitude is not needed for the radii of curvature calculations).

2.  **List the given constants:**
    -   Equatorial radius of Jupiter, $R_e = 7.15 \times 10^7$ m
    -   Polar radius of Jupiter, $R_p = 6.69 \times 10^7$ m
    -   Planetographic latitude, $\phi = -21^\circ$

3.  **Calculate $\epsilon = R_e / R_p$ and $\epsilon^{-2}$:**
    $\epsilon = \frac{7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m}}{6.69 \times 10^7 \text{ m}} = \frac{7.15}{6.69} \approx 1.0687593$
    $\epsilon^{-2} = \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{6.69}{7.15}\right)^2 \approx (0.935664)^2 \approx 0.8754619$

4.  **Calculate the zonal radius of curvature, $\bar{r}$ (or $r(\phi)$):**
    The formula for the zonal radius of curvature is: $r(\phi)=R_{e}\left(1+\epsilon^{-2}\tan^{2}\phi\right)^{-1/2}$
    First, calculate $\tan^2\phi$:
    $\tan(-21^\circ) \approx -0.383864$
    $\tan^2(-21^\circ) \approx (-0.383864)^2 \approx 0.147392$

    Now substitute the values into the formula:
    $r(\phi) = 7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times (1 + 0.8754619 \times 0.147392)^{-1/2}$
    $r(\phi) = 7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times (1 + 0.129080)^{-1/2}$
    $r(\phi) = 7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times (1.129080)^{-1/2}$
    $r(\phi) = 7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times 0.941604$
    $\bar{r} \approx 6.7324 \times 10^7$ m

5.  **Calculate the meridional radius of curvature, $\overline{R}$ (or $R(\phi)$):**
    The formula for the meridional radius of curvature is: $R(\phi)=R_{e}\epsilon^{-2}\left(\frac{r(\phi)}{R_{e}\cos\phi}\right)^{3}$
    First, calculate $\cos\phi$:
    $\cos(-21^\circ) \approx 0.933580$

    Now calculate the term inside the parenthesis: $\frac{r(\phi)}{R_{e}\cos\phi}$
    $\frac{6.7324 \times 10^7 \text{ m}}{7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times 0.933580} = \frac{6.7324}{6.6749} \approx 1.008611$

    Now cube this term:
    $(1.008611)^3 \approx 1.026079$

    Finally, substitute all values into the formula for $R(\phi)$:
    $R(\phi) = 7.15 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times 0.8754619 \times 1.026079$
    $R(\phi) = 6.2600 \times 10^7 \text{ m} \times 1.026079$
    $\overline{R} \approx 6.4225 \times 10^7$ m

6.  **Round to appropriate significant figures:**
    The input values ($R_e$, $R_p$) have 3 significant figures. The estimated latitude is also roughly to 2-3 significant figures. Therefore, we should round our results to 3 significant figures.

    $\bar{r} \approx 6.73 \times 10^7$ m
    $\overline{R} \approx 6.42 \times 10^7$ m

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{zonal radius } \bar{r} \approx 6.73 \times 10^7 \text{ m, meridional radius } \overline{R} \approx 6.42 \times 10^7 \text{ m}}$.",1.092
