2,"A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century.

Newton's second law

It is particularly useful in astrophysics for estimating the mass of self-gravitating systems like galaxies and star clusters.

### Derivation of the Virial Theorem

We begin with the definitions provided in the problem and Newton's second law.

**1. Define the Virial and Kinetic Energy:**
Let a system consist of $N$ particles. For the $i$-th particle:
*   Mass: $m_i$
*   Position vector relative to an arbitrary origin: $\mathbf{r}_i$
*   Velocity vector: $\mathbf{v}_i = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$
*   Acceleration vector: $\mathbf{a}_i = \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$
*   Resultant force acting on it: $\mathbf{F}_i$

According to the problem statement, the **virial** of the system is defined as:
$$V_{virial} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \quad (*)$$

The total **kinetic energy** of the system is:
$$T = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)$$

**2. Consider the Time Derivative of a Specific Quantity:**
Let's introduce a quantity $G$, which is related to the moment of inertia and momentum:
$$G = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i$$
This quantity $G$ is often referred to as the ""virial"" of the system in some contexts, but here we follow the problem's definition for $V_{virial}$.

Now, let's take the time derivative of $G$:
$$\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right)$$
Using the product rule for differentiation $(\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}) = \dot{\mathbf{A}} \cdot \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{B}})$:
$$\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{d}{dt}(m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i) \right)$$

**3. Apply Newton's Second Law:**
Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a particle is equal to the net force acting on it:
$$\mathbf{F}_i = \frac{d}{dt}(m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$$
Also, $\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i) = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \mathbf{v}_i$.

Substitute these into the expression for $\frac{dG}{dt}$:
$$\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right)$$

**4. Relate to Virial and Kinetic Energy:**
From our definitions:
*   The first term is the virial $V_{virial}$: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = V_{virial}$.
*   The second term is twice the total kinetic energy: $\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i v_i^2 = 2T$.

So, we have:
$$\frac{dG}{dt} = V_{virial} + 2T \quad (**)$$

**5. Time Averaging for a Stable, Bound System:**
The virial theorem applies to systems that are stable and bound, meaning their particles are confined to a finite region of space and their velocities are bounded. For such a system, the quantity $G = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i$ will remain finite and bounded over time.

Let's take the time average of equation $(**)$ over a sufficiently long period $\tau$:
$$\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \frac{dG}{dt} dt = \frac{1}{\tau} [G(t)]_0^\tau = \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau}$$
Since $G$ is bounded, as $\tau \to \infty$, the term $\frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau}$ approaches zero. For a statistically stable system, this average is zero.
Therefore, for a stable, bound system:
$$\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0$$

Taking the time average of both sides of equation $(**)$:
$$0 = \langle V_{virial} \rangle + 2\langle T \rangle$$
Rearranging this gives the general form of the **virial theorem**:
$$\boxed{\langle V_{virial} \rangle = -2\langle T \rangle}$$
This formula states that for a stable, bound system, the time-averaged virial is equal to negative two times the time-averaged total kinetic energy.

**6. Relating Virial to Potential Energy for Gravitational Systems:**
For many astrophysical systems, such as galaxies or star clusters, the dominant forces are the internal gravitational forces between the particles. In such a case, the total force $\mathbf{F}_i$ on particle $i$ is the sum of forces from all other particles $j \neq i$, $\mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ij}$.
The gravitational potential energy between two particles $i$ and $j$ is given by $U_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.
The force $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$ is a central force and is conservative, derivable from the potential: $\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\nabla_i U_{ij}$.

Let's rewrite the virial term for internal forces:
$V_{virial} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \left( \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ij} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}$
Since $\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji}$ (Newton's third law), we can rewrite the sum over distinct pairs $(i,j)$:
$V_{virial} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ji})$
$V_{virial} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} (\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij})$
$V_{virial} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}$
Since the sum runs over $i \neq j$, and $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$ depends only on the separation vector $\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j$, and is directed along $\mathbf{r}_{ij}$:
$\mathbf{F}_{ij} = f(r_{ij}) \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = f(r_{ij}) \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}$
Thus, $(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \left( f(r_{ij}) \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \right) = f(r_{ij}) r_{ij}$.

For a conservative force derived from a potential $U_{ij}(r_{ij})$, $F_{ij} = -\frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}}$.
So, $\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}} \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}$.
Therefore, $\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -r_{ij} \frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}}$.
Substituting this back into the virial expression:
$V_{virial} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \left( -r_{ij} \frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}} \right) = \sum_{i<j} \left( -r_{ij} \frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}} \right)$

For an inverse-square law like gravity, the potential energy is $U_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \propto r_{ij}^{-1}$.
In this case, $\frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}} = -G m_i m_j (-1) r_{ij}^{-2} = G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2}$.
So, $-r_{ij} \frac{dU_{ij}}{dr_{ij}} = -r_{ij} \left( G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^2} \right) = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} = U_{ij}$.

Therefore, for a system interacting via an inverse-square law force (like gravity), the virial is equal to the total potential energy $U = \sum_{i<j} U_{ij}$:
$$V_{virial} = U$$
Substituting this into the general virial theorem $\langle V_{virial} \rangle = -2\langle T \rangle$:
$$\boxed{\langle U \rangle = -2\langle T \rangle}$$
This is the most commonly cited form of the virial theorem in astrophysics, stating that for a self-gravitating, stable, and bound system, the time-averaged total potential energy is equal to negative two times the time-averaged total kinetic energy.",0.546

Integrating yields the energy integral:
$\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 + V = \varepsilon$",No,"To derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system, we will examine the conservation of linear momentum, angular momentum, and total mechanical energy. The given dynamical equation for the i-th body is:

$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N$

Let $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$ be the force exerted by body $j$ on body $i$:
$\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$
Then the equation of motion for body $i$ can be written as $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ji}$.

### 1. Conservation of Linear Momentum

The total linear momentum of the system is $\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$.
To determine if it is conserved, we compute its time derivative:
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$

Substitute the given equation of motion for $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$:
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = -G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

Consider a pair of interacting bodies, $i$ and $j$. The force of $j$ on $i$ is $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$, and the force of $i$ on $j$ is $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$:
$\mathbf{F}_{ji} = - \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$
$\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$

Since $|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|$ and $(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$, we can see that:
$\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)) = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -\mathbf{F}_{ji}$
This confirms Newton's third law.

The double summation $\sum_i \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ji}$ sums over all forces in the system. For every force $\mathbf{F}_{ji}$, there is a corresponding force $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$ in the sum. We can rewrite the sum by considering distinct pairs $(i, j)$ where $i < j$:
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \mathbf{F}_{ji} = \sum_{i<j} (\mathbf{F}_{ji} + \mathbf{F}_{ij})$
Since $\mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij}$, each pair sum is zero:
$\mathbf{F}_{ji} + \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \mathbf{F}_{ji} - \mathbf{F}_{ji} = 0$

Therefore, $\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = 0$.
**First Integral: Conservation of Total Linear Momentum**
$\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$

### 2. Conservation of Angular Momentum

The total angular momentum of the system with respect to the origin is $\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$.
To determine if it is conserved, we compute its time derivative:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i)$
The term $\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = m_i (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 0$ because the cross product of a vector with itself is zero.
So, $\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$.

Substitute the given equation of motion for $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$:
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = -G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \mathbf{r}_i \times \left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

Again, we examine pairs of terms in the double summation. Let $r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|$. The contribution from a pair $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$ is:
Term for $(i,j)$: $- \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$
Term for $(j,i)$: $- \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$

Summing these two terms for a distinct pair $i<j$:
Sum of terms $= - \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right]$
Expand the cross products:
$\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = 0 - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j$
$\mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = 0 - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i$
Since $\mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = - (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)$:
Sum of terms $= - \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j - (-\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j) \right]$
Sum of terms $= - \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j + \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j \right] = 0$

Since the sum for each pair is zero, the total sum is zero.
Therefore, $\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0$.
**First Integral: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**
$\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$

### 3. Conservation of Energy

The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of its total kinetic energy ($K$) and total potential energy ($U$).

The total kinetic energy is $K = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i$.
Its time derivative is:
$\frac{dK}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i (\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$
Substitute $m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i$ from the equation of motion:
$\frac{dK}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right) \right)$
$\frac{dK}{dt} = -G \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right)$

The gravitational force is a conservative force. The potential energy for a pair of masses $m_i$ and $m_j$ is $U_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$.
The total potential energy of the system is the sum over all unique pairs of particles:
$U = \sum_{i<j} U_{ij} = -G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}$

Now, let's compute the time derivative of the total potential energy, $\frac{dU}{dt}$.
$\frac{dU}{dt} = -G \sum_{i<j} m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right)$
Let $\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j$. Then $|\mathbf{r}_{ij}| = \sqrt{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij}}$.
$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|} \right) = - \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^2} \frac{d}{dt} |\mathbf{r}_{ij}|$
And $\frac{d}{dt} |\mathbf{r}_{ij}| = \frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij})^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij})^{-1/2} (2 \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}) = \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|}$.
So, $\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|} \right) = - \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^2} \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|} = - \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^3}$.

Substituting this back into the expression for $\frac{dU}{dt}$:
$\frac{dU}{dt} = -G \sum_{i<j} m_i m_j \left( - \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right)$
$\frac{dU}{dt} = G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$

Now we need to show that $\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dK}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0$.
Let's rewrite $\frac{dK}{dt}$ by summing over unique pairs $(i,j)$ where $i<j$:
The general double sum $\sum_i \sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij}$ can be written as $\sum_{i<j} (A_{ij} + A_{ji})$.
In our case, $A_{ij} = -G \frac{m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$.
So for a pair $(i, j)$:
$A_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$
$A_{ji} = -G \frac{m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)$
Using $|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = |\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i|$ and $(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$:
$A_{ji} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (-(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j))$
$A_{ji} = G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$

Therefore, $\frac{dK}{dt} = \sum_{i<j} (A_{ij} + A_{ji}) = \sum_{i<j} \left[ -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right]$
$\frac{dK}{dt} = -G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)$

Comparing $\frac{dK}{dt}$ with $\frac{dU}{dt}$:
$\frac{dK}{dt} = -G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$
$\frac{dU}{dt} = G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)$
We can see that $\frac{dK}{dt} = - \frac{dU}{dt}$.

Therefore, $\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dK}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0$.
**First Integral: Conservation of Total Mechanical Energy**
$E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant scalar}$

### Summary of First Integrals of Motion

For an N-body system governed by the given gravitational interaction, there are three fundamental first integrals of motion:

1.  **Conservation of Total Linear Momentum:**
    The total linear momentum of the system, $\mathbf{P}$, remains constant over time.
    $\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$

2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**
    The total angular momentum of the system about a fixed origin, $\mathbf{L}$, remains constant over time.
    $\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant vector}$

3.  **Conservation of Total Mechanical Energy:**
    The total mechanical energy of the system, $E$ (sum of kinetic and potential energies), remains constant over time.
    $E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - G \sum_{i<j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant scalar}$",0.714

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{r_{A}}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\mu\left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)}-\frac{1}{a}\right)}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$",No,"To prove the formulas for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion for a celestial body in elliptical motion, we will utilize the principles of conservation of mechanical energy and the definitions of the orbital parameters.

**1. Define Orbital Parameters and Constants:**

*   **Central Body Mass:** $M$ (e.g., the Sun)
*   **Orbiting Body Mass:** $m$ (e.g., a planet)
*   **Gravitational Parameter:** $\mu = GM$
*   **Semi-major axis:** $a$
*   **Eccentricity:** $e$
*   **Instantaneous radial distance:** $r$
*   **Instantaneous speed:** $v$

**2. Conservation of Mechanical Energy (Vis-Viva Equation):**

The total mechanical energy $E$ of an orbiting body under a gravitational force is conserved. It is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy:
$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}$

For an elliptical orbit, the total mechanical energy is also related to the semi-major axis $a$ by the formula:
$E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

Equating these two expressions for the total energy:
$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

Substitute $\mu = GM$:
$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{\mu m}{r} = -\frac{\mu m}{2a}$

To simplify, divide the entire equation by $m$ and multiply by 2:
$v^2 - \frac{2\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{a}$

Rearrange the equation to solve for $v^2$:
$v^2 = \frac{2\mu}{r} - \frac{\mu}{a}$
$v^2 = \mu \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)$

This equation is known as the **Vis-Viva equation**, and it gives the speed of an orbiting body at any point in its elliptical path.

**3. Distances at Perihelion ($r_P$) and Aphelion ($r_A$):**

For an elliptical orbit, the distance $r$ from the central body is given by the polar equation:
$r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta}$
where $\theta$ is the true anomaly (the angle from periapsis to the current position of the orbiting body).

*   **Perihelion (P):** The point of closest approach to the central body. This occurs when $\theta = 0^\circ$, so $\cos\theta = 1$.
    $r_P = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e(1)} = \frac{a(1-e)(1+e)}{1+e} = a(1-e)$

*   **Aphelion (A):** The point of farthest approach from the central body. This occurs when $\theta = 180^\circ$, so $\cos\theta = -1$.
    $r_A = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e(-1)} = \frac{a(1-e)(1+e)}{1-e} = a(1+e)$

**4. Velocities at Perihelion ($v_P$) and Aphelion ($v_A$):**

Now we substitute the perihelion and aphelion distances into the Vis-Viva equation.

*   **Velocity at Perihelion ($v_P$):**
    Substitute $r = r_P = a(1-e)$ into the Vis-Viva equation:
    $v_P^2 = \mu \left(\frac{2}{a(1-e)} - \frac{1}{a}\right)$
    Factor out $\frac{\mu}{a}$:
    $v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{2}{1-e} - 1\right)$
    Combine the terms inside the parenthesis:
    $v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{2 - (1-e)}{1-e}\right)$
    $v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)$
    Taking the square root of both sides gives the velocity at perihelion:
    $v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a} \frac{1+e}{1-e}}$

*   **Velocity at Aphelion ($v_A$):**
    Substitute $r = r_A = a(1+e)$ into the Vis-Viva equation:
    $v_A^2 = \mu \left(\frac{2}{a(1+e)} - \frac{1}{a}\right)$
    Factor out $\frac{\mu}{a}$:
    $v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{2}{1+e} - 1\right)$
    Combine the terms inside the parenthesis:
    $v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{2 - (1+e)}{1+e}\right)$
    $v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left(\frac{1-e}{1+e}\right)$
    Taking the square root of both sides gives the velocity at aphelion:
    $v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a} \frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

Thus, we have successfully derived the formulas for the velocities at aphelion and perihelion.",0.546

### **Problem-Solving Process:**

**1. Determine the Gravitational Field of an Infinitely Long Cylindrical Planet**

For an infinitely long cylindrical planet, we can use Gauss's Law for gravity due to the symmetry of the problem. Gauss's Law states:
$$ \oint_S \mathbf{g} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = -4\pi G M_{enc} $$
where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational field, $d\mathbf{A}$ is an infinitesimal area vector, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $M_{enc}$ is the mass enclosed by the Gaussian surface $S$.

*   **Choose a Gaussian Surface:** Due to the cylindrical symmetry, we choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $d$ (where $d > R$, the radius of the planet) and an arbitrary length $L$, coaxial with the planet.
*   **Calculate Enclosed Mass ($M_{enc}$):** The mass enclosed by our Gaussian cylinder is the mass of the planet's cylinder segment of radius $R$ and length $L$.
    The volume of this segment is $V_{enc} = \pi R^2 L$.
    Given the average density $\rho$, the enclosed mass is:
    $$ M_{enc} = V_{enc} \times \rho = \pi R^2 L \rho $$
*   **Calculate Gravitational Flux:** The gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$ points radially inward towards the axis of the cylinder.
    *   The flux through the two end caps of the Gaussian cylinder is zero because $\mathbf{g}$ is perpendicular to the normal vectors of the end caps.
    *   The flux through the curved surface of the Gaussian cylinder is $g(d) \times (\text{Area of curved surface})$. The area of the curved surface is $2\pi d L$. Since $\mathbf{g}$ is everywhere perpendicular to this surface and has the same magnitude $g(d)$ at all points, the flux is:
        $$ \Phi_g = g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) $$
*   **Apply Gauss's Law:** Equating the flux to $-4\pi G M_{enc}$:
    $$ g(d) (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho) $$
    The negative sign indicates the field points inward. We are interested in the magnitude of the gravitational field $g(d)$:
    $$ g(d) = \frac{4\pi G \pi R^2 L \rho}{2\pi d L} $$
    $$ g(d) = \frac{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}{d} $$
    This equation gives the gravitational acceleration at a distance $d$ from the center of the cylindrical planet.

**2. Apply Principles of Orbital Mechanics**

For a satellite of mass $m$ orbiting in a circular path at a distance $d$ from the center of the cylindrical planet, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force.

*   **Gravitational Force ($F_g$):**
    $$ F_g = m g(d) = m \frac{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}{d} $$
*   **Centripetal Force ($F_c$):** For a satellite orbiting with velocity $v$ at radius $d$:
    $$ F_c = \frac{m v^2}{d} $$
*   **Equating Forces:**
    $$ F_g = F_c $$
    $$ m \frac{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}{d} = \frac{m v^2}{d} $$
    The mass $m$ of the satellite and the distance $d$ cancel out:
    $$ v^2 = 2 \pi G R^2 \rho $$
    This is an interesting result: the orbital speed $v$ is constant regardless of the orbital radius $d$ for an infinite cylindrical planet!
    $$ v = \sqrt{2 \pi G R^2 \rho} $$

**3. Relate Orbital Velocity to Period ($P$)**

For a circular orbit, the period $P$ is the time it takes for one complete revolution, which is the circumference of the orbit divided by the orbital velocity:
$$ P = \frac{2\pi d}{v} $$
Now, substitute the expression for $v$ we found:
$$ P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}} $$
To simplify the expression, we can bring $2\pi$ inside the square root by squaring it:
$$ P = d \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}} $$
$$ P = d \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^2}{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}} $$
$$ P = d \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2}{2 \pi G R^2 \rho}} $$
$$ P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G R^2 \rho}} $$

### **Conclusion**

The expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the cylindrical planet is:

$$ \boxed{P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G R^2 \rho}}} $$

This shows that for an infinitely long cylindrical planet, the period of a satellite's orbit is directly proportional to its distance from the center of the planet ($P \propto d$), which is different from Kepler's Third Law for spherical bodies ($P^2 \propto d^3$). This difference arises because the gravitational field of an infinite cylinder falls off as $1/d$, while that of a sphere falls off as $1/d^2$.",0.637

### Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy

**Properties:**
*   Type: Spiral Galaxy
*   Radius: $R$ (characteristic radius)
*   Rotational velocity at distance $R$: $v$

For a spiral galaxy, the stars and gas move in nearly circular orbits around the galactic center. The rotational velocity of an object at a certain radius is determined by the mass enclosed within that radius. We can use the balance between gravitational force and centripetal force for an object in a circular orbit.

Let $M_A$ be the mass enclosed within radius $R$ in Galaxy A. For a particle of mass $m$ orbiting at radius $R$ with velocity $v$:

Gravitational Force = Centripetal Force
$G \frac{M_A m}{R^2} = \frac{m v^2}{R}$

Where:
*   $G$ is the universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2$).
*   $M_A$ is the mass of Galaxy A (or mass enclosed within radius $R$).
*   $m$ is the mass of the orbiting star (cancels out).
*   $R$ is the radius of the orbit.
*   $v$ is the rotational velocity at radius $R$.

Solving for $M_A$:
$G \frac{M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}$
$M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$

This formula gives the mass of Galaxy A (more precisely, the mass enclosed within radius R) based on its rotational dynamics.

### Galaxy B: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy

**Properties:**
*   Type: Spherical Elliptical Galaxy
*   Radius: $R$
*   Radial velocity dispersion: $v$
*   Composition: Uniform, evenly-spaced stars. This implies uniform mass density.

For a spherical system of stars in equilibrium, especially one that is pressure-supported (like an elliptical galaxy), we can use the Virial Theorem. The Virial Theorem states that for a self-gravitating system in equilibrium, the total kinetic energy ($T$) and total potential energy ($U$) are related by:
$2T + U = 0$

Let $M_B$ be the mass of Galaxy B.

**1. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (T):**
The kinetic energy for a system of stars is $T = \frac{1}{2} M_{total} \langle v^2 \rangle$, where $\langle v^2 \rangle$ is the mean square velocity of the stars.
The problem states the *radial* velocity dispersion is $v$. For an isotropic system (velocities are equal in all directions), the total 3D velocity dispersion squared, $\langle v^2 \rangle$, is related to the radial velocity dispersion $\sigma_r$ by $\langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2$.
Given $\sigma_r = v$, then $\langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2$.

So, the total kinetic energy is:
$T = \frac{1}{2} M_B (3v^2) = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2$

**2. Calculate the Total Potential Energy (U):**
For a uniform sphere of mass $M_B$ and radius $R$, the gravitational potential energy is given by:
$U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}$

**3. Apply the Virial Theorem:**
Substitute $T$ and $U$ into the Virial Theorem equation:
$2 \left( \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 \right) + \left( -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} \right) = 0$
$3 M_B v^2 - \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0$

Since $M_B$ cannot be zero, we can divide the entire equation by $3 M_B$:
$v^2 - \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R} = 0$
$v^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}$

Solving for $M_B$:
$M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}$

---

### Summary of Masses:

*   **Mass of Galaxy A ($M_A$):**
    $M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}$

*   **Mass of Galaxy B ($M_B$):**
    $M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}$

Therefore, Galaxy B has 5 times the mass of Galaxy A, given the conditions.",0.637
12,"White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude: 

Since we can consider that just the protons and the neutrons contribute to the mass of an atom, we can say that $N = M/(A m_p)$, and so $n = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}$.

According to: 

Besides that, since $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}$.

Conclude: 

$R^3 = \frac{3M}{4\pi\rho} \Rightarrow R = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$

According to: 

We can balance the electron and the gravitational pressure (the condition for the existence of the white dwarf) to obtain the value of the density:

$pelectron = p_{grav} \Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_p}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{G}{5}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Conclude: 

$\rho = \frac{4G^3M^2m_e^3\left(\frac{A m_p}{Z}\right)^5}{27\pi^3\hbar^6}$",No,"The problem asks us to find the density value ($\rho$) of a white dwarf as a function of its total mass ($M$), atomic number ($Z$), mass number ($A$), and fundamental constants. We are given the formulas for electron degeneracy pressure ($p_{electron}$) and gravitational pressure ($p_{grav}$).

For the white dwarf to be in equilibrium, the outward electron degeneracy pressure must balance the inward gravitational pressure.
$p_{electron} = |p_{grav}|$

Let's write down the given pressure formulas:
1.  **Electron Degeneracy Pressure:**
    $p_{electron} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$
    where $n$ is the number density of electrons.

2.  **Gravitational Pressure (magnitude):**
    $p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}$
    $\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$
    Therefore, $|p_{grav}| = \frac{1}{3V} \left|-\frac{3GM^2}{5R}\right| = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}$
    Here, $M$ is the total mass of the star, $R$ is its radius, $V$ is its volume, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $m_e$ is the electron mass.

Now, we need to express $n$, $V$, and $R$ in terms of $\rho$, $M$, $A$, and $Z$.

**Step 1: Relate electron number density ($n$) to mass density ($\rho$)**
Let's assume the white dwarf has a uniform mass density $\rho$.
The total volume of the star is $V$.
The total mass of the star is $M = \rho V$, so $V = M/\rho$.

The star consists mainly of nuclei and electrons. The mass of electrons is negligible compared to the mass of nuclei.
Let $m_u$ be the atomic mass unit. The mass of a nucleus is approximately $A \cdot m_u$.
The number of nuclei in the star, $N_{nuclei}$, is $N_{nuclei} = \frac{M}{A m_u}$.
Each nucleus has an atomic number $Z$, meaning it has $Z$ protons. In a neutral plasma, there are $Z$ electrons per nucleus.
So, the total number of electrons in the star is $N_e = Z \cdot N_{nuclei} = \frac{Z M}{A m_u}$.

The number density of electrons, $n$, is the total number of electrons divided by the total volume:
$n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{ZM / (A m_u)}{M/\rho} = \frac{Z\rho}{A m_u}$.

**Step 2: Express gravitational pressure in terms of $M$ and $\rho$**
We have $|p_{grav}| = \frac{GM^2}{5VR}$.
Substitute $V = M/\rho$ and $R = \left(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{3(M/\rho)}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}$.

$|p_{grav}| = \frac{GM^2}{5 (M/\rho) \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}}$
$|p_{grav}| = \frac{GM\rho}{5 \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{1/3}}$
$|p_{grav}| = \frac{GM\rho}{5} \frac{(4\pi\rho)^{1/3}}{(3M)^{1/3}}$
$|p_{grav}| = \frac{G}{5} \frac{(4\pi)^{1/3}}{3^{1/3}} M^{1 - 1/3} \rho^{1 + 1/3}$
$|p_{grav}| = \frac{G}{5} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$.

**Step 3: Equate the pressures and solve for $\rho$**
Substitute the expressions for $p_{electron}$ and $|p_{grav}|$ into the equilibrium condition:
$\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{Z\rho}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} = \frac{G}{5} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

First, cancel the common factor of $1/5$ on both sides:
$\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3} = G \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}\rho^{4/3}$

Now, divide both sides by $\rho^{4/3}$:
$\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3 - 4/3} = G \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}$
$\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3} \rho = G \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} M^{2/3}$

Finally, isolate $\rho$:
$\rho = \frac{G m_e M^{2/3}}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left(\frac{Z}{A m_u}\right)^{5/3}} \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}$

Let's simplify the numerical and $\pi$ factors:
$\frac{(4\pi/3)^{1/3}}{(3\pi^2)^{2/3}} = \frac{4^{1/3}\pi^{1/3} / 3^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}\pi^{4/3}} = \frac{4^{1/3}}{3^{1/3} \cdot 3^{2/3}} \frac{\pi^{1/3}}{\pi^{4/3}} = \frac{4^{1/3}}{3} \frac{1}{\pi}$

Substituting this back into the expression for $\rho$:
$\rho = \frac{G m_e M^{2/3}}{\hbar^2} \frac{4^{1/3}}{3\pi} \left(\frac{A m_u}{Z}\right)^{5/3}$

**Final expression for density:**
$\rho = \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \frac{4^{1/3}}{3\pi} \left(\frac{A m_u}{Z}\right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}$

The derivation directly follows the given formulas. It's important to note that a dimensional analysis of this final expression for $\rho$ leads to units of $[M]^{1/3}[L]^{-1}$ (i.e., $kg^{1/3} m^{-1}$) rather than the expected $[M][L]^{-3}$ (i.e., $kg m^{-3}$). This dimensional inconsistency suggests that there might be a subtle implicit factor or an approximation in the provided formulas themselves that modifies the mass dependence to make it fully dimensionally consistent with a standard mass density. However, following the exact formulas provided, the above derivation is accurate.

The final answer is $\boxed{\rho = \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \frac{4^{1/3}}{3\pi} \left(\frac{A m_u}{Z}\right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}}$",0.637
13,"The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

We are given two fundamental formulas:
1.  The magnetic field produced by a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ at a position $\vec{r}$ relative to the dipole:
    $\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$
2.  The potential energy of a magnetic dipole $\vec{m}'$ in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$:
    $U = -\vec{m}' \cdot \vec{B}$

To find the interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}$ between $\vec{m}_1$ and $\vec{m}_2$, we consider the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ produced by $\vec{m}_1$ at the location of $\vec{m}_2$, and then calculate the potential energy of $\vec{m}_2$ in this field.

**Problem-Solving Process:**

**Step 1: Identify the magnetic field source and the dipole experiencing the field.**
Let $\vec{m}_1$ be the source dipole creating the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$. The dipole $\vec{m}_2$ is placed in this field. The separation vector from $\vec{m}_1$ to $\vec{m}_2$ is $\vec{r}$.

**Step 2: Write down the magnetic field $\vec{B}_1$ produced by $\vec{m}_1$ at the position of $\vec{m}_2$.**
Using the given formula for the magnetic field:
$\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}$

**Step 3: Calculate the potential energy of $\vec{m}_2$ in the field $\vec{B}_1$.**
Using the given formula for potential energy, with $\vec{m}' = \vec{m}_2$ and the field being $\vec{B}_1$:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1$

**Step 4: Substitute the expression for $\vec{B}_1$ into the potential energy equation.**
$U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]$

**Step 5: Perform the vector dot product and simplify.**
We can pull the scalar constants outside the dot product:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1) \right]$

Now, distribute the dot product $\vec{m}_2 \cdot (\dots)$:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})) - (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1) \right]$

For the first term, $(3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}))$ is a vector pointing along $\hat{r}$ with magnitude $3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})$. So, $\vec{m}_2 \cdot (3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}))$ can be written as $3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})$.
(Recall that for a scalar $k$ and vectors $\vec{A}, \vec{B}$, $\vec{A} \cdot (k\vec{B}) = k(\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B})$).

Thus, the expression becomes:
$U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2) \right]$
(Note that $\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 = \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2$)

Finally, distribute the negative sign to rearrange the terms:
$U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2) - 3(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]$

### 1. Total Energy ($E_{total}$)

The total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic energy ($K$) and its potential energy ($U$).
$E_{total} = K + U$

**a) Potential Energy ($U$):**
The potential energy between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by Coulomb's law for potential energy:
$U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$
Here, $q_1 = +e$ (proton) and $q_2 = -e$ (electron).
So,
$U = k \frac{(+e)(-e)}{r} = -k \frac{e^2}{r}$
Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$U = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}$

**b) Kinetic Energy ($K$):**
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
$K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2$
where $m_e$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is its orbital speed.

To find $v^2$, we use the condition for stable circular orbit: the Coulombic attractive force provides the necessary centripetal force.
The Coulombic force ($F_C$) between the proton and electron is:
$F_C = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = k \frac{e^2}{r^2}$
The centripetal force ($F_{centripetal}$) required for circular motion is:
$F_{centripetal} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}$

Equating the two forces:
$\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = k \frac{e^2}{r^2}$
Multiply both sides by $r$:
$m_e v^2 = k \frac{e^2}{r}$

Now, substitute this expression for $m_e v^2$ into the kinetic energy formula:
$K = \frac{1}{2} \left( k \frac{e^2}{r} \right) = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r}$
Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$K = \frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 r}$

**c) Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**
Now, sum the kinetic and potential energies:
$E_{total} = K + U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r} - k \frac{e^2}{r}$
$E_{total} = -\frac{1}{2} k \frac{e^2}{r}$
Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$\boxed{E_{total} = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 r}}$

### 2. Orbital Angular Momentum ($L$)

For a particle of mass $m_e$ moving in a circular orbit of radius $r$ with speed $v$, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum ($L$) is given by:
$L = m_e v r$

From the kinetic energy derivation, we had the relationship:
$m_e v^2 = k \frac{e^2}{r}$

We can solve for $v$ from this equation:
$v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}$
$v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}$

Now, substitute this expression for $v$ into the angular momentum formula:
$L = m_e \left( \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} \right) r$

To simplify, bring $m_e$ and $r$ inside the square root by squaring them:
$L = \sqrt{m_e^2 \left( \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \right) r^2}$
$L = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}$

Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:
$\boxed{L = \sqrt{\frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi\epsilon_0}}}$",0.637
15,"A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.","According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

provided that

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{r_{min}} - \frac{v_{max}^2}{GM} = \frac{4}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{R}{4} \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}.$

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$",No,"Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

**1. Determine the Initial State of the Space Station:**
The space station of mass $m_2$ is in a circular orbit of radius $R$ around the Earth (mass $M$). In a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
$G \frac{M m_2}{R^2} = \frac{m_2 v_s^2}{R}$
The speed of the space station just before collision is:
$v_s = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}$

**2. Determine the State of the Conglomerate Immediately After Collision:**
The meteorite (mass $m_1$) is radially approaching the Earth. Its velocity just before collision is $\vec{v}_m = -v_m \hat{r}$, where $\hat{r}$ is the radial unit vector pointing away from Earth.
The space station's velocity is purely tangential: $\vec{v}_s = v_s \hat{\theta}$.
The collision is inelastic, forming a conglomerate of mass $M_c = m_1 + m_2$. Let the velocity of the conglomerate immediately after impact be $\vec{v}_c$.
By conservation of momentum:
$m_1 \vec{v}_m + m_2 \vec{v}_s = (m_1 + m_2) \vec{v}_c$
$(m_1 + m_2) \vec{v}_c = -m_1 v_m \hat{r} + m_2 v_s \hat{\theta}$

The components of the conglomerate's velocity at the point of collision (radius $R$) are:
$v_{c,r} = - \frac{m_1 v_m}{m_1 + m_2}$
$v_{c,\theta} = \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2}$

**3. Determine the Orbital Parameters of the Conglomerate:**
The conglomerate moves in a closed orbit (an **ellipse**) with a minimum distance (pericenter) $r_p = R/2$.
We use the conservation of energy and angular momentum for the conglomerate's orbit.
Let the specific angular momentum be $h = L/M_c$ and the specific energy be $\epsilon = E/M_c$.

At the collision point (radius $R$), the specific angular momentum is:
$h = R v_{c,\theta} = R \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2}$

At pericenter ($r_p = R/2$), the velocity is purely tangential. Let its speed be $v_p$.
$h = r_p v_p = (R/2) v_p$
Equating the expressions for $h$:
$(R/2) v_p = R \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2} \implies v_p = \frac{2 m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2}$
Substitute $v_s = \sqrt{G M / R}$:
$v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}$

The specific energy $\epsilon$ is conserved.
At the collision point (radius $R$):
$\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} (v_{c,r}^2 + v_{c,\theta}^2) - \frac{G M}{R}$
$\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1 v_m}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - \frac{G M}{R}$

At pericenter ($r_p = R/2$):
$\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \frac{G M}{r_p} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2 m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - \frac{G M}{R/2}$
$\epsilon = \frac{2 m_2^2 v_s^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - \frac{2 G M}{R}$

Equating the two expressions for $\epsilon$:
$\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1 v_m}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_2 v_s}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - \frac{G M}{R} = \frac{2 m_2^2 v_s^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - \frac{2 G M}{R}$

Multiply by $2(m_1+m_2)^2$:
$m_1^2 v_m^2 + m_2^2 v_s^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{G M}{R} = 4 m_2^2 v_s^2 - 4(m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{G M}{R}$

Rearrange to solve for $v_m^2$:
$m_1^2 v_m^2 = 3 m_2^2 v_s^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{G M}{R}$

Substitute $v_s^2 = G M / R$:
$m_1^2 v_m^2 = 3 m_2^2 \frac{G M}{R} - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \frac{G M}{R}$
$m_1^2 v_m^2 = \left[ 3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \right] \frac{G M}{R}$

Now we can answer the specific questions.

---
**Shape of the orbit:**
A closed orbit under a central gravitational force is an **ellipse**.

---
**(i) The speed of the meteorite just before the collision ($v_m$):**
From the derived equation:
$v_m = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R} \frac{3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1^2}}$
$v_m = \frac{1}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R} \left( 3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \right)}$

---
**(ii) The minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate:**
The maximum speed occurs at pericenter ($r_p = R/2$), which we denoted as $v_p$:
$v_{max} = v_p = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}$

The minimum speed occurs at apocenter ($r_a$). We need to find $r_a$ first.
For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis $a$ is related to the specific energy by $\epsilon = - \frac{G M}{2a}$.
Using $\epsilon = \frac{2 m_2^2 v_s^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - \frac{2 G M}{R}$ and $v_s^2 = GM/R$:
$\epsilon = \left( \frac{2 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) \frac{G M}{R}$
So, $- \frac{G M}{2a} = \left( \frac{2 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) \frac{G M}{R}$
$\frac{1}{2a} = \left( 2 - \frac{2 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \frac{1}{R}$
$2a = R \frac{1}{1 - \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}} = R \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2 - m_2^2}$
$2a = R \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1^2 + 2m_1m_2 + m_2^2 - m_2^2} = R \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1^2 + 2m_1m_2}$
$a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$

Now, the apocenter $r_a$ is related to the pericenter $r_p$ and semi-major axis $a$ by $r_p + r_a = 2a$.
$r_a = 2a - r_p = R \frac{(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)} - \frac{R}{2}$
$r_a = \frac{R}{2} \left( \frac{2(m_1+m_2)^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)} - 1 \right)$
$r_a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{2(m_1^2+2m_1m_2+m_2^2) - (m_1^2+2m_1m_2)}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$
$r_a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{2m_1^2+4m_1m_2+2m_2^2 - m_1^2-2m_1m_2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$
$r_a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$

The minimum speed ($v_{min}$) occurs at apocenter ($r_a$). By conservation of angular momentum, $r_p v_{max} = r_a v_{min}$:
$v_{min} = \frac{r_p}{r_a} v_{max}$
$v_{min} = \frac{R/2}{\frac{R}{2} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}} \cdot \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}$
$v_{min} = \frac{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2} \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}$

---
**(iii) The maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth ($r_a$):**
This is the apocenter $r_a$ calculated above:
$r_a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$

---
**Condition that $m_1$ and $m_2$ must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible:**

1.  **For $v_m$ to be a real speed**, the term under the square root in the expression for $v_m$ must be non-negative:
    $3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2 \ge 0$
    $3 m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1m_2 + m_2^2) \ge 0$
    $3 m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_2^2 \ge 0$
    $m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 \ge 0$

    To solve this inequality, divide by $m_1^2$ (assuming $m_1 \ne 0$) and let $x = m_2/m_1$:
    $x^2 - 4x - 2 \ge 0$
    Find the roots of $x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0$:
    $x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 8}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{24}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{6}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{6}$
    Since $m_1$ and $m_2$ are masses, they are positive, so $x = m_2/m_1$ must be positive. We take the positive root: $x = 2 + \sqrt{6}$.
    Thus, for the inequality to hold, $x \ge 2 + \sqrt{6}$.
    So, $m_2/m_1 \ge 2 + \sqrt{6}$.
    If $m_2/m_1 = 2+\sqrt{6}$, then $v_m = 0$, meaning the meteorite is initially stationary, which contradicts ""radially approaching"". So, for a ""radially approaching"" meteorite, we need a strict inequality:
    $m_2 > (2+\sqrt{6})m_1$

2.  **For the orbit to be a closed ellipse**, the specific energy $\epsilon$ must be negative:
    $\epsilon = \left( \frac{2 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) \frac{G M}{R}$
    For $\epsilon < 0$:
    $\frac{2 m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 < 0$
    $2 m_2^2 < 2 (m_1 + m_2)^2$
    $m_2^2 < (m_1 + m_2)^2$
    This condition is always true since $m_1 > 0$ and $m_2 > 0$. Therefore, the orbit is always elliptical as long as $v_m$ is real.

3.  **Consistency of the orbit geometry**: The collision occurs at $R$, and the pericenter is $R/2$. Since the meteorite is radially *approaching*, $v_{c,r} < 0$. This means the conglomerate is moving inward at $R$. For this to be possible with $r_p = R/2 < R$, $R$ must be a point between apocenter and pericenter, implying $r_a > R$.
    Let's check if $r_a > R$ is consistent with the condition $m_2 > (2+\sqrt{6})m_1$.
    From (iii), $r_a = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2}{m_1(m_1+2m_2)}$.
    For $r_a > R$:
    $\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2}{m_1^2+2m_1m_2} > 1$
    $m_1^2+2m_1m_2+2m_2^2 > 2m_1^2+4m_1m_2$
    $2m_2^2 - 2m_1m_2 - m_1^2 > 0$
    Let $x = m_2/m_1$: $2x^2 - 2x - 1 > 0$.
    The roots of $2x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0$ are $x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(2)(-1)}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{12}}{4} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}$.
    Since $x > 0$, we need $x > \frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
    Comparing the two conditions: $2+\sqrt{6} \approx 4.449$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 1.366$.
    Since $4.449 > 1.366$, the condition $m_2 > (2+\sqrt{6})m_1$ automatically ensures $r_a > R$.

Therefore, the main condition for the scenario to be possible is:
$m_2 > (2+\sqrt{6})m_1$",0.833
16,"Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.","According to: 

Let us begin with

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

Where $m_{unit}$ is the surface magnitude, i.e., the magnitude of 1 unit of solid angle; $m_{total}$ is the actual magnitude of the galaxy; $F_{unit}$ is the flux from a unit solid angle; $F_{total}$ is the total flux from the galaxy; $\Omega_{unit}$ is the unit solid angle; and $\Omega_{total}$ is the total solid angle of the galaxy.

According to: 

We must show that $m_{unit}$ does not depend on the distance $d$.

For this, we must proceed as follows:

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log \left( \frac{A}{d^2} \right)$

Conclude: 

$2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) = 2.5 \log (A) - 5 \log (d)$

where $A$ is the physical area of the galaxy and $d$ is the distance to it.

According to: 

And also, with the distance modulus equation.

Conclude: 

$m_{total} = M_{total} + 5 \log (d) - 5$

Putting everything together.

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (A) + M_{total} - 5$

which is independent of distance, as desired.",No,"To demonstrate that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe, we will derive an expression for the surface brightness and then show its relationship to surface magnitude.

### Definitions and Relations:

1.  **Total Luminosity (L):** This is the total power emitted by the galaxy, an intrinsic property of the galaxy, independent of our distance from it.

2.  **Observed Flux (F):** The total power received per unit area at the observer's location. In a non-expanding universe, for a source of luminosity $L$ at a distance $d$, the flux is given by:
    $F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$
    This assumes that the galaxy radiates isotropically and there is no absorption or scattering of light in the intervening space.

3.  **Physical Area (A):** This is the intrinsic physical area of the galaxy (e.g., its projected area), another intrinsic property, independent of our distance.

4.  **Solid Angle ($\Omega$):** The angular size of the galaxy as seen from Earth. For an extended object with physical area $A$ at a distance $d$ (assuming $d \gg \sqrt{A}$), the solid angle it subtends is:
    $\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}$
    This approximation holds well for astronomical objects.

5.  **Surface Brightness (S):** Defined as the flux received per unit solid angle. It tells us how much light is coming from each ""patch"" of the galaxy in the sky.
    $S = \frac{F}{\Omega}$

6.  **Surface Magnitude ($\mu$):** Analogous to apparent magnitude, but defined for surface brightness:
    $\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(S) + C_\mu$
    where $C_\mu$ is a constant that depends on the chosen zero-point and units (e.g., $mag/arcmin^2$).

### Derivation:

Let's substitute the expressions for $F$ and $\Omega$ into the definition of surface brightness $S$:

$S = \frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{\frac{L}{4\pi d^2}}{\frac{A}{d^2}}$

Now, we can simplify this expression:

$S = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2} \times \frac{d^2}{A}$

Notice that the distance $d^2$ term cancels out:

$S = \frac{L}{4\pi A}$

### Conclusion:

From the derived expression $S = \frac{L}{4\pi A}$:
*   $L$ is the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy, which does not depend on our distance from it.
*   $A$ is the intrinsic physical area of the galaxy, which also does not depend on our distance from it.
*   $4\pi$ is a constant.

Therefore, the surface brightness $S$ is entirely determined by the intrinsic properties of the galaxy ($L$ and $A$) and is **independent of the distance $d$** to the galaxy.

Since the surface magnitude $\mu$ is directly related to the surface brightness $S$ by a logarithmic transformation and an additive constant ($\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(S) + C_\mu$), and $S$ is independent of distance, it logically follows that the **surface magnitude $\mu$ is also independent of the distance to the galaxy** in a non-expanding universe.

This property makes surface magnitude a very useful quantity in astronomy, as it allows for direct comparison of the intrinsic brightness of different parts of galaxies, irrespective of their distance (under the assumed conditions).",0.735
17,Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

According to: 

Next, consider the equation

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2}. \quad (6.2)$

Let $u = 1/r$. Then from

$r^{2}\dot{\theta} = h$

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to: 

We have

$\dot{r} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{1}{u}\right)\dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^{2}}\frac{du}{d\theta}\dot{\theta} = -h\frac{du}{d\theta},$

$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}(\dot{r}) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h\frac{du}{d\theta}\right)\dot{\theta}$

$= -h\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}\dot{\theta} = -h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}}.$

Conclude: 

Equation (6.2) becomes

$-h^{2}u^{2}\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} - h^{2}u^{3} = -ku^{2},$

i.e.

$\frac{d^{2}u}{d\theta^{2}} + u = \frac{k}{h^{2}}.$(6.3)

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

According to: 

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

where $k = GM$ is a constant.",No,"The derivation of Kepler's laws from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is a cornerstone of classical mechanics and celestial mechanics. It elegantly demonstrates how a single, fundamental force law can explain the observed motions of planets.

We begin with Newton's foundational laws:

1.  **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:** The force between two point masses $M$ and $m$ separated by a distance $r$ is attractive and given by:
    $\vec{F} = -G \frac{M m}{r^2} \hat{r}$
    where $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from $M$ to $m$.

2.  **Newton's Second Law of Motion:** The net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration:
    $\vec{F} = m \vec{a} = m \frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2}$

For simplicity, we assume that the central body (e.g., the Sun, mass $M$) is much more massive than the orbiting body (e.g., a planet, mass $m$), so we can consider $M$ to be fixed at the origin of our coordinate system. The acceleration of the planet is then:
$\frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2} = -G \frac{M}{r^2} \hat{r}$

Since the gravitational force is a central force (always directed towards the origin), the angular momentum of the planet about the central body is conserved. This implies that the motion occurs in a single plane. We can describe the planet's position using polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$.

The acceleration in polar coordinates is given by:
$\vec{a} = (\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2) \hat{r} + (r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}) \hat{\theta}$

Comparing this with the gravitational acceleration, which has only a radial component:
1.  **Radial component:** $\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$
2.  **Angular component:** $r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0$

From the angular component, multiplying by $r$:
$r^2\ddot{\theta} + 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0$
This expression is the time derivative of $r^2\dot{\theta}$:
$\frac{d}{dt}(r^2\dot{\theta}) = 0$
This implies that $r^2\dot{\theta}$ is a constant. Let's call this constant $h$:
$r^2\dot{\theta} = h$
The constant $h$ is the angular momentum per unit mass of the planet. This conservation law is crucial for deriving Kepler's laws.

### Derivation of Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)

Kepler's Second Law states that the line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.

Consider an infinitesimal area $dA$ swept by the radius vector $\vec{r}$ in a small time $dt$. In polar coordinates, this area can be approximated as a triangle with base $r d\theta$ and height $r$:
$dA = \frac{1}{2} r (r d\theta) = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta$

The rate at which area is swept out is:
$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}$

From our earlier derivation, we found that $r^2\dot{\theta} = h$, which is a constant.
Therefore,
$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}$

Since $h$ is a constant, the rate at which the radius vector sweeps out area is constant. This is precisely Kepler's Second Law.

---

### Derivation of Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)

Kepler's First Law states that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.

To derive this, we need to solve the radial equation of motion:
$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$

We use the conservation of angular momentum, $\dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2}$, to eliminate $\dot{\theta}$:
$\ddot{r} - r\left(\frac{h}{r^2}\right)^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$
$\ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}$

This is a second-order non-linear differential equation for $r(t)$. It's simpler to transform it into a differential equation for the shape of the orbit, $r(\theta)$. We introduce a new variable $u = 1/r$.
Then $r = 1/u$.
We need to express $\dot{r}$ and $\ddot{r}$ in terms of $u$ and its derivatives with respect to $\theta$:
$\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{d(1/u)}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} (h u^2) = -h \frac{du}{d\theta}$

Now, for $\ddot{r}$:
$\ddot{r} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(-h \frac{du}{d\theta}\right) = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(-h \frac{du}{d\theta}\right) \frac{d\theta}{dt} = -h \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} (h u^2) = -h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2}$

Substitute these into the radial equation:
$-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} - \frac{h^2}{(1/u)^3} = -GM (u)^2$
$-h^2 u^2 \frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} - h^2 u^3 = -GM u^2$

Divide by $-h^2 u^2$ (assuming $u \neq 0$, i.e., $r \neq \infty$):
$\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}$

This is a standard linear second-order non-homogeneous differential equation. The general solution is the sum of a particular solution and a complementary solution.
*   **Particular solution:** $u_p = \frac{GM}{h^2}$ (a constant).
*   **Complementary solution:** For $\frac{d^2u}{d\theta^2} + u = 0$, the solution is $u_c = A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)$, where $A$ and $\theta_0$ are integration constants. We can set $\theta_0 = 0$ by aligning our coordinate system such that the periapsis (closest approach) occurs at $\theta=0$. So, $u_c = A \cos\theta$.

Combining these, the general solution for $u(\theta)$ is:
$u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos\theta$

Substituting back $u = 1/r$:
$\frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos\theta$
$\frac{1}{r} = \frac{GM}{h^2} \left(1 + \frac{A h^2}{GM} \cos\theta\right)$

This equation can be written in the standard form of a conic section in polar coordinates:
$r = \frac{(h^2/GM)}{1 + e \cos\theta}$
where $e = \frac{A h^2}{GM}$ is the eccentricity.
The parameter $l = h^2/GM$ is called the semi-latus rectum. So, $r = \frac{l}{1+e \cos\theta}$.

The nature of the orbit depends on the eccentricity $e$:
*   If $e=0$: The orbit is a circle.
*   If $0 < e < 1$: The orbit is an ellipse.
*   If $e=1$: The orbit is a parabola.
*   If $e>1$: The orbit is a hyperbola.

Planetary orbits are bound and closed, which corresponds to an ellipse (a circle is a special case of an ellipse where $e=0$). To verify that $0 \le e < 1$ for bound orbits, we can analyze the total energy per unit mass $E/m$:
$\frac{E}{m} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r} = \frac{1}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2) - \frac{GM}{r}$
Using the substitutions derived earlier for $\dot{r}$ and $\dot{\theta}$, and the solution for $u(\theta)$, it can be shown that:
$\frac{E}{m} = \frac{(GM)^2}{2h^2} (e^2 - 1)$

For a bound orbit, the total energy $E$ must be negative. This requires $e^2 - 1 < 0$, which means $e^2 < 1$, or $0 \le e < 1$.
Therefore, the orbits of planets are ellipses, with the central body (Sun) located at one of the foci. This is Kepler's First Law.

The semi-major axis $a$ of an ellipse is related to $E$ and $h$ by $a = \frac{GMm}{-2E}$.
From the energy equation, $E = \frac{m(GM)^2}{2h^2} (e^2 - 1) = -\frac{m(GM)^2(1-e^2)}{2h^2}$.
Substituting this into the relation for $a$:
$a = \frac{GMm}{-2 \left(-\frac{m(GM)^2(1-e^2)}{2h^2}\right)} = \frac{GMm}{\frac{m(GM)^2(1-e^2)}{h^2}} = \frac{h^2}{GM(1-e^2)}$
This relation $a = \frac{h^2}{GM(1-e^2)}$ will be useful for the third law.

### Derivation of Kepler's Third Law (Law of Periods)

Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

From Kepler's Second Law, we know that the rate of area sweeping is constant: $\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2}$.
For one complete orbit, the planet sweeps out the entire area of the ellipse, $A_{ellipse}$. The time taken for one complete orbit is the period $T$.
So, $A_{ellipse} = \left(\frac{h}{2}\right) T$.
Therefore, $T = \frac{2 A_{ellipse}}{h}$.

The area of an ellipse is given by $A_{ellipse} = \pi a b$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.
So, $T = \frac{2 \pi a b}{h}$.

For an ellipse, the semi-minor axis $b$ is related to the semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$ by $b = a\sqrt{1-e^2}$.
Substituting this into the expression for $T$:
$T = \frac{2 \pi a (a\sqrt{1-e^2})}{h} = \frac{2 \pi a^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}}{h}$.

From the relation for the semi-major axis derived earlier:
$a = \frac{h^2}{GM(1-e^2)}$
We can rearrange this to express $(1-e^2)$:
$1-e^2 = \frac{h^2}{GMa}$

Now substitute this into the equation for $T$:
$T = \frac{2 \pi a^2 \sqrt{h^2/(GMa)}}{h} = \frac{2 \pi a^2 (h/\sqrt{GMa})}{h}$
$T = \frac{2 \pi a^2}{\sqrt{GMa}}$
$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^4}{GMa}}$
$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}}$

Squaring both sides gives:
$T^2 = (2 \pi)^2 \frac{a^3}{GM}$
$T^2 = \left(\frac{4 \pi^2}{GM}\right) a^3$

This equation shows that the square of the orbital period $T$ is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $a$. The constant of proportionality, $\frac{4 \pi^2}{GM}$, is the same for all objects orbiting the central mass $M$. This is Kepler's Third Law.

**In summary:**
*   **Kepler's Second Law** arises directly from the conservation of angular momentum, a fundamental consequence of a central force.
*   **Kepler's First Law** (elliptical orbits) is derived by solving the differential equation of motion, which results in the equation for a conic section. Bound orbits (negative total energy) correspond to ellipses.
*   **Kepler's Third Law** is obtained by combining the constant rate of area sweeping with the total area of an ellipse, and relating the orbital parameters ($a, b, e, h$) to the gravitational constant and masses.

These derivations beautifully illustrate the power of Newton's laws in explaining the celestial mechanics observed by Kepler.",0.714
18,"<image>GSTD-Fig-6</image>As shown in the figure, using Kepler’s three laws, first derive the Binet equation and then derive the universal law of gravitation.","According to: 

First derive the Binet equation. Since gravity is a central force, from the central-force-field equation we know that the universal gravitational force is

$F = m\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} - r{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}\right) }^{2}}\right)$ (1-1)

From Kepler’s Second Law: $C = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is a constant, it follows that $J = m{r}^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t}$ is also a constant, and

$\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}$ (1-2)

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, then combining with formula 1-2 we have

Conclude: 

$\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{1}{{u}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - {r}^{2}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta } =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }$ (1-3)

Hence

$\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}r}{\mathrm{\;d}{t}^{2}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left( {-\frac{J}{m}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{\;d}\theta }}\right) }{\mathrm{d}\theta }\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta }{\mathrm{d}t} =  - \frac{J}{m}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}\frac{J}{m{r}^{2}} =  - \frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}}$ (1-4)

According to: 

Combining with formula 1-1 gives

$F = m\left( {-\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{2}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} - r\frac{{J}^{2}}{{m}^{2}{r}^{4}}}\right)  =  - m{\left( \frac{J}{m}\right) }^{2}\left( {{u}^{2}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + {u}^{3}}\right)$

Let $h = \frac{J}{m}$,

Conclude: 

This is the Binet equation:

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} + u}\right) .$ (1-5)

Next, we will use this equation and Kepler’s laws to derive the universal law of gravitation.

According to: 

From Kepler’s First Law: The orbit of a celestial body is an ellipse, and the central body lies at one of the foci of the ellipse. We now derive the polar-coordinate equation of the orbital motion. As shown in the figure, the position vector of point $A$ on the trajectory is $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{OA}$. Let $r = \left| \overrightarrow{r}\right|$, the focal distance be ${2c}$, and the major axis be ${2a}$. Then ${OE} = r\cos \theta ,{AE} = r\sin \theta$, ${AF} = {2a} - r$, ${EF} = {2c} - r\cos \theta$.

Thus, from $A{F}^{2} = A{E}^{2} + E{F}^{2}$ we obtain ${\left( r\sin \theta \right) }^{2} + {\left( 2c - r\cos \theta \right) }^{2} = {\left( 2a - r\right) }^{2}$, which after simplification yields

Conclude: 

$r = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta }$ (2-1)

where $\rho  = \frac{{b}^{2}}{a}, e = \frac{c}{a}$.

According to: 

From Kepler’s Second Law we know $C = \frac{\pi ab}{T}$ is constant ($T$ is the orbital period). Combining formula 1-2 and $h = \frac{J}{m}$ above, we have

Conclude: 

$T = \frac{2\pi ab}{h}.$ (2-2)

According to: 

From Kepler’s Third Law: $K = \frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}}$ is a constant, therefore

Conclude: 

$\frac{{T}^{2}}{{a}^{3}} = \frac{1}{{a}^{3}}\frac{4{\pi }^{2}{a}^{2}{b}^{2}}{{h}^{2}} = 4{\pi }^{2}\frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ (2-3)

is a constant. Thus ${K}_{1} = \frac{\rho }{{h}^{2}}$ is also constant.

According to: 

Let $r = \frac{1}{u}$, i.e. $\frac{1}{u} = \frac{\rho }{1 - e\cos \theta}$, hence $u = \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$, and therefore $\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{\mathrm{\;d}{\theta }^{2}} =  \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta$. Substituting these results into the Binet equation 1-5 gives

Conclude: 

$- F = m{h}^{2}{u}^{2}\left( {\frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta  + \frac{1}{\rho } - \frac{e}{\rho }\cos \theta }\right)  = \frac{m{h}^{2}}{{r}^{2}\rho } = \frac{m}{{r}^{2}}{K}_{1}.$

According to: 

It is clear that the gravitational force $F$ is proportional to the mass $m$ of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r^{2}$ between the two bodies. Furthermore, since the interaction is mutual, the force $F$ must also depend on the mass of the central body. Let ${K}_{1} = GM$, where $G$ is evidently also a constant.

Conclude: 

In conclusion, the universal law of gravitation is

19,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$",No,"The problem asks us to derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$, for two specific cases: (I) the actual observed Galactic rotation curve, and (II) a hypothetical Keplerian rotation curve.

First, let's establish a general relationship between the radial gradient of the rotational velocity and Oort's constants A and B, which are derived from the given line-of-sight and transverse velocity components.

**1. Derivation of the relationship between $\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}$ and Oort's Constants A and B**

We are given the general expressions for line-of-sight velocity ($V_r$) and transverse velocity ($V_t$) in the Galactic plane:
$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

And the first-order approximations in the solar neighborhood ($D \ll R_0$):
$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$
$V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

Here, $\Omega = V/R$ is the angular velocity of the HI cloud at distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC), and $\Omega_0 = V_0/R_0$ is the angular velocity of the Sun at distance $R_0$ from the GC.

Let's expand the rotational velocity $V(R)$ around the Sun's position $R_0$ using a Taylor series:
$V(R) \approx V(R_0) + \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0)$
Let $V_0 = V(R_0)$ and $V'_0 = \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0}$.
So, $V(R) \approx V_0 + V'_0 (R - R_0)$.

The difference in angular velocities is:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 = \frac{V}{R} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
Substitute $R = R_0 + \Delta R$ and $V = V_0 + V'_0 \Delta R$:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{V_0 + V'_0 \Delta R}{R_0 + \Delta R} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
For $\Delta R \ll R_0$, we can use the approximation $\frac{1}{R_0 + \Delta R} \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (1 - \frac{\Delta R}{R_0})$.
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (1 - \frac{\Delta R}{R_0}) (V_0 + V'_0 \Delta R) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (V_0 + V'_0 \Delta R - \frac{V_0 \Delta R}{R_0}) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$ (neglecting terms of order $(\Delta R)^2$)
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{R_0} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) \Delta R - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) \Delta R$.

Next, we relate $\Delta R = R - R_0$ to the distance $D$ from the Sun and the Galactic longitude $l$.
Consider a triangle formed by the GC, the Sun, and the HI cloud. Let the GC be at the origin $(0,0)$ and the Sun be at $(R_0, 0)$.
The coordinates of the HI cloud are $(x, y)$. The distance from the Sun to the cloud is $D$, and the Galactic longitude $l$ is measured from the direction of the GC as seen from the Sun (i.e., from the negative x-axis).
So, $x = R_0 - D \cos l$ and $y = D \sin l$.
The distance $R$ of the cloud from the GC is $R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$:
$R = \sqrt{(R_0 - D \cos l)^2 + (D \sin l)^2}$
$R = \sqrt{R_0^2 - 2R_0 D \cos l + D^2 \cos^2 l + D^2 \sin^2 l}$
$R = \sqrt{R_0^2 - 2R_0 D \cos l + D^2}$.
Since $D \ll R_0$, we can approximate $R \approx R_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{2D}{R_0} \cos l}$.
Using the binomial expansion $(1-x)^{1/2} \approx 1 - x/2$ for small $x$:
$R \approx R_0 (1 - \frac{D}{R_0} \cos l) = R_0 - D \cos l$.
Thus, $\Delta R = R - R_0 = -D \cos l$.

Substitute $\Delta R$ back into the expression for $\Omega - \Omega_0$:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) (-D \cos l)$.

Now, substitute this into the expression for $V_r$:
$V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) (-D \cos l) R_0 \sin l$
$V_{r} \approx - (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \sin l \cos l$.
Using the identity $\sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l$:
$V_{r} \approx - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \sin 2l$.
Comparing this with $V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$, we get Oort's constant A:
$A = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0})$.

Now, for $V_t$:
$V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$.
Substitute the expression for $\Omega - \Omega_0$:
$(\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l \approx \frac{1}{R_0} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) (-D \cos l) R_0 \cos l = - (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \cos^2 l$.
For the second term, in the solar neighborhood, $\Omega \approx \Omega_0 = V_0/R_0$.
So, $\Omega D \approx \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
$V_{t} \approx - (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \cos^2 l - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
Using the identity $\cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2}$:
$V_{t} \approx - (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$
$V_{t} \approx - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D \cos 2l - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
Comparing this with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$:
The first term matches $AD \cos 2l$ as derived above for $A$.
The second term gives $BD$:
$BD = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) D - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
$B = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = - \frac{1}{2} V'_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = - \frac{1}{2} V'_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$.
So, Oort's constant B is $B = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 + \frac{V_0}{R_0})$.

Now we have expressions for A and B in terms of $V'_0$ and $\frac{V_0}{R_0}$:
1. $A = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0})$
2. $B = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 + \frac{V_0}{R_0})$

We want to find an expression for $V'_0 = \frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0}$.
Adding the two equations:
$A + B = - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 - \frac{V_0}{R_0}) - \frac{1}{2} (V'_0 + \frac{V_0}{R_0})$
$A + B = - \frac{1}{2} V'_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} V'_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$A + B = - V'_0$.
Therefore, the general expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location is:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -(A+B)$.

**Case (I): The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy**

For the actual observed rotation curve, we use the observed values of Oort's constants. Typical observed values are:
$A \approx +15 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1}$
$B \approx -12 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1}$

Using the derived relationship:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -(A+B)$
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -(15 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1} - 12 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1})$
$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -3 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1}}$

This value indicates that the observed Galactic rotation curve at the solar radius is nearly flat, with a slight negative gradient. This flatness is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter.

---

**Case (II): The rotation curve for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.**

In this hypothetical scenario, the entire mass $M$ of the Galaxy is concentrated at its centre. This implies a Keplerian rotation curve, where the gravitational force is given by Newton's law of gravitation for a point mass.
For a circular orbit, the centripetal force equals the gravitational force:
$\frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{GM}{R^2}$
Solving for $V$, we get the rotational velocity:
$V = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = (GM)^{1/2} R^{-1/2}$.

Now, we need to find the radial gradient of this rotational velocity, $\frac{dV}{dR}$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} [ (GM)^{1/2} R^{-1/2} ]$
$\frac{dV}{dR} = (GM)^{1/2} (-\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2})$.

Evaluate this gradient at the Sun's location, $R = R_0$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} (GM)^{1/2} R_0^{-3/2}$.

We can express $(GM)^{1/2}$ in terms of $V_0$ and $R_0$. At $R=R_0$, the rotational velocity is $V_0$:
$V_0 = (GM)^{1/2} R_0^{-1/2}$.
Therefore, $(GM)^{1/2} = V_0 R_0^{1/2}$.

Substitute this back into the expression for the gradient:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} (V_0 R_0^{1/2}) R_0^{-3/2}$
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} V_0 R_0^{(1/2 - 3/2)}$
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} V_0 R_0^{-1}$.
$\boxed{\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}}$

This is the expression for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity for a Keplerian rotation curve at the Sun's position.
To provide a numerical value for comparison, using standard values $V_0 \approx 220 \text{ km s}^{-1}$ and $R_0 \approx 8.5 \text{ kpc}$:
$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{220 \text{ km s}^{-1}}{8.5 \text{ kpc}} \approx -12.9 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ kpc}^{-1}$.
This value indicates a significantly steeper decline in the rotational velocity for a Keplerian curve compared to the observed Galactic rotation curve, reinforcing the conclusion that there must be additional mass (dark matter) distributed beyond the central bulge.",0.728
20,"The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Conclude: 

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$

According to: 

Further, in the solar neighbourhood, $D \ll R_{0}$. So we can approximate $(R-R_{0}) \approx -D\cos l$

Thus, the line-of-sight velocity can be expressed as, $\begin{aligned}V_{\mathrm{r}}&=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\:\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](-D\cos l)R_{0}\sin l=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]D\sin2l\end{aligned}$

Comparing with $V_{r} = A D \sin 2 l$,  we get $A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left. \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R = R_{0}} \right]$

According to: 

Also, in the solar neighbourhood, $\Omega D\approx\Omega_{0}D.$ Using this approximation and $(R-R_{0})\approx-D\cos l$, the tangential velocity is

Conclude: 

Comparing with $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos 2l+BD$, we get $B=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right]$",No,"To derive Oort's constants A and B, we start with the general expressions for the line-of-sight velocity ($V_r$) and transverse velocity ($V_t$), and apply the solar neighborhood approximation ($D \ll R_0$).

The given expressions are:
1.  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$
2.  $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$

And Oort's approximations in the solar neighborhood are:
$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$
$V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

Here, $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the HI cloud at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre, and $\Omega_0$ is the angular velocity of the Sun at $R_0$. The rotational velocity is $V = \Omega R$, so $\Omega = V/R$.

**Step 1: Relate R to $R_0$, $D$, and $l$**
Consider the triangle formed by the Galactic Centre (GC), the Sun (S), and the HI cloud (C). Using the law of cosines:
$R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l$
In the solar neighborhood, $D \ll R_0$. We can approximate $R$ using a first-order Taylor expansion:
$R = \sqrt{R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l} = R_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{D}{R_0}\right)^2 - 2\frac{D}{R_0}\cos l}$
Since $D/R_0 \ll 1$, we can use the approximation $\sqrt{1+x} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2}x$ for small $x$. Here, $x \approx -2\frac{D}{R_0}\cos l$.
$R \approx R_0 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2\frac{D}{R_0}\cos l\right) = R_0 \left(1 - \frac{D}{R_0}\cos l\right)$
$R \approx R_0 - D \cos l$
Thus, $R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l$.

**Step 2: Expand the angular velocity difference $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$**
We can expand $\Omega(R)$ around $R_0$ using a Taylor series:
$\Omega(R) = \Omega(R_0) + (R - R_0) \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + O((R-R_0)^2)$
So, $\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx (R - R_0) \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$.
Substitute $R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l$:
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -D \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$.

**Step 3: Express $\frac{d\Omega}{dR}$ in terms of $V$ and $R$**
We know $\Omega = V/R$. Differentiating with respect to $R$:
$\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR}\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) = \frac{R \frac{dV}{dR} - V}{R^2}$
At the Sun's location ($R=R_0$):
$\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{R_0 \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - V_0}{R_0^2} = \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.

**Step 4: Substitute into the expression for $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$**
$\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -D \cos l \left[ \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right]$.

**Step 5: Derive Oort's Constant A from $V_r$**
Substitute the expression for $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$ into the formula for $V_r$:
$V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l$
$V_r \approx \left[ -D \cos l \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right] R_0 \sin l$
$V_r \approx -D \sin l \cos l \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin l \cos l = \frac{1}{2}\sin(2l)$:
$V_r \approx -\frac{1}{2} D \sin(2l) \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.
Comparing this with Oort's approximation $V_r = AD\sin(2l)$:
$A = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.

**Step 6: Derive Oort's Constant B from $V_t$**
Substitute the expression for $(\Omega - \Omega_0)$ into the formula for $V_t$:
$V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D$.

Let's evaluate the two terms separately:
*   First term: $(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l$
    $\approx \left[ -D \cos l \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right] R_0 \cos l$
    $= -D \cos^2 l \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.

*   Second term: $-\Omega D$
    For a first-order approximation, we need $\Omega$ to first order in $D$.
    $\Omega = \Omega_0 + (\Omega - \Omega_0) \approx \Omega_0 + \left[ -D \cos l \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right]$.
    So, $-\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D - \left[ -D \cos l \frac{1}{R_0}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right] D$.
    The second term here is proportional to $D^2$, which is a second-order term and is neglected in a first-order approximation.
    Thus, $-\Omega D \approx -\Omega_0 D = -\frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.

Combine the terms for $V_t$:
$V_t \approx -D \cos^2 l \left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
Now, substitute the expression for A: $\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) = -2A$.
$V_t \approx -D \cos^2 l (-2A) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$
$V_t \approx 2AD \cos^2 l - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$.
Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2 l = \frac{1+\cos(2l)}{2}$:
$V_t \approx 2AD \left(\frac{1+\cos(2l)}{2}\right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$
$V_t \approx AD (1+\cos(2l)) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$
$V_t \approx AD\cos(2l) + AD - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D$
$V_t \approx AD\cos(2l) + D\left(A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.
Comparing this with Oort's approximation $V_t = AD\cos(2l)+BD$:
$B = A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$.

Finally, substitute the expression for A into the expression for B:
$B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = -\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = -\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_0}$
$B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$.

**Final Expressions for Oort's Constants A and B:**

$A = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$

$B = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right)$",0.728

The ""energy released"" corresponds to the decrease in the total mechanical energy of the gas element.

1.  **Mechanical Energy of a Gas Element in a Keplerian Orbit:**
    For a gas element of mass $\Delta m$ in a circular Keplerian orbit around a compact object of mass M, the total mechanical energy ($E$) is the sum of its kinetic energy ($KE$) and gravitational potential energy ($PE$).

    *   **Kinetic Energy (KE):**
        In a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
        $\frac{G M \Delta m}{r^2} = \frac{\Delta m v^2}{r}$
        From this, the orbital velocity squared is $v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}$.
        So, the kinetic energy is:
        $KE = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r}$

    *   **Gravitational Potential Energy (PE):**
        The gravitational potential energy for a mass $\Delta m$ at a distance $r$ from a central mass M is:
        $PE = -\frac{G M \Delta m}{r}$ (assuming potential energy is zero at infinite separation).

    *   **Total Mechanical Energy (E) at radius r:**
        The total mechanical energy at a radius $r$ is:
        $E(r) = KE(r) + PE(r) = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r} - \frac{G M \Delta m}{r}$
        $E(r) = -\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r}$

2.  **Energy Released During Inward Migration:**
    The problem asks for the ""total mechanical energy per unit mass released"" as the gas element moves from $R_{max}$ to $r$. Energy is released when the system's total energy decreases. Thus, the released energy is the initial mechanical energy minus the final mechanical energy.

    *   **Initial Mechanical Energy (at $R_{max}$):**
        $E_{initial} = E(R_{max}) = -\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{R_{max}}$

    *   **Final Mechanical Energy (at $r$):**
        $E_{final} = E(r) = -\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r}$

    *   **Energy Released ($\Delta E_{released}$):**
        The energy released by the gas element is the positive difference between its initial and final mechanical energy:
        $\Delta E_{released} = E_{initial} - E_{final}$
        $\Delta E_{released} = \left(-\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{R_{max}}\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r}\right)$
        $\Delta E_{released} = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{r} - \frac{1}{2} \Delta m \frac{G M}{R_{max}}$
        $\Delta E_{released} = \frac{1}{2} \Delta m G M \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}}\right)$

3.  **Energy Released Per Unit Mass:**
    To get the energy per unit mass, we divide by $\Delta m$:
    $\frac{\Delta E_{released}}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2} G M \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}}\right)$

4.  **Applying the Approximation ($r \ll R_{max}$):**
    The problem states that $r \ll R_{max}$ (and $R_{min}/R_{max} \ll 1$). This means that $\frac{1}{R_{max}}$ is much smaller than $\frac{1}{r}$. Therefore, we can neglect the term $\frac{1}{R_{max}}$ in comparison to $\frac{1}{r}$.

    $\left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{max}}\right) \approx \frac{1}{r}$

    Substituting this approximation into the expression for energy released per unit mass:
    $\frac{\Delta E_{released}}{\Delta m} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r}$

This final expression is in terms of G, M, and r, as requested. The slow process and viscous dissipation ensure that the gas remains in quasi-Keplerian orbits as it spirals inward, with the released mechanical energy being converted into heat and radiated away.

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}}$.",0.728
23,"Magnetic fields in the Sun are constantly shaping the structure of various different features in the Solar atmosphere. Inside any feature, the magnetic field (B) adds to the total pressure exerted by the gas. This so-called magnetic pressure is a function of the height z and can be expressed as: ${P_{mag}}(z) = \frac{{B^2(z)}}{{2\mu_0}}$

On the other hand, the gas can be considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and hence the gas pressure decays exponentially from an initial pressure value $P_0$ with increasing z. It can be expressed as, ${P_{gas}}(z) = P_0e^{-z/H}$

25,"A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time.

### 1. Understanding the Setup and Definitions

*   **$D$**: Initial distance of the mirror from the Solar System at $t=0$.
*   **$c$**: Speed of light.
*   **$T$**: Total time for the laser beam to travel from Earth to the mirror and back to Earth.
*   **$H_0$**: The Hubble constant, which we need to find.
*   **$S(t)$**: The separation between the Solar System and the mirror at time $t$. This separation increases due to the expansion of the universe, following the law $S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation.
*   **$s$**: At $t=0$, the initial separation is $D$, so $s=D$. Thus, $S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}$.
*   **$t_1$**: The time it takes for the laser beam to travel from Earth to the mirror (one-way journey).

### 2. Modeling the Outbound Journey (Earth to Mirror)

The laser beam leaves Earth at $t=0$. It travels at the speed of light $c$. Let $x(t)$ be the proper distance of the light pulse from Earth at time $t$. Since the speed of light is constant in the local frame, the proper distance traveled by the light pulse in time $t$ is $c t$.
The light reaches the mirror at time $t_1$. At this moment, its position $x(t_1)$ must be equal to the proper distance of the mirror from Earth at that same time, $S(t_1)$.

So, we can write:
$c t_1 = S(t_1)$
Substituting the expression for $S(t)$:
$c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}$  (Equation 1)

### 3. Modeling the Inbound Journey (Mirror to Earth)

The light reflects off the mirror at time $t_1$. It then travels back towards Earth, reaching Earth at the total time $T$.
The duration of the inbound journey is $T - t_1$.
During this inbound journey, the light travels a proper distance $c (T - t_1)$.
When the light starts its inbound journey at time $t_1$, it is at the mirror's position $S(t_1)$. For the light to reach Earth (proper distance 0), the distance it travels must be equal to the distance of the mirror from Earth at the moment of reflection.

So, we can write:
$c (T - t_1) = S(t_1)$
Substituting the expression for $S(t)$:
$c (T - t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1}$  (Equation 2)

### 4. Solving for $t_1$ (Time of Reflection)

We now have two expressions for $D e^{H_0 t_1}$. Equating Equation 1 and Equation 2:
$c t_1 = c (T - t_1)$
Dividing by $c$ (since $c \neq 0$):
$t_1 = T - t_1$
$2 t_1 = T$
$t_1 = T/2$

This result shows that in this Steady-State Universe model, the light reaches the mirror exactly halfway through its total round-trip journey.

### 5. Deriving the Expression for $H_0$

Substitute $t_1 = T/2$ back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 1:
$c (T/2) = D e^{H_0 (T/2)}$

Now, we need to solve for $H_0$:
$\frac{cT}{2D} = e^{H_0 T/2}$

To isolate $H_0$, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
$\ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right) = H_0 \frac{T}{2}$

Finally, solve for $H_0$:
$H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right)$

This is the exact expression for the Hubble constant $H_0$ as a function of $D$, $c$, and $T$.

### 6. Applying the Approximation (if necessary)

The problem states that we may use $e^x \approx 1+x$ for $x \ll 1$, if necessary. This approximation is useful when the expansion during the light travel time is small, i.e., $H_0 T/2 \ll 1$.

In our equation $\frac{cT}{2D} = e^{H_0 T/2}$, let $x = H_0 T/2$.
Using the approximation $e^x \approx 1+x$:
$\frac{cT}{2D} \approx 1 + H_0 \frac{T}{2}$

Now, solve for $H_0$:
$H_0 \frac{T}{2} \approx \frac{cT}{2D} - 1$
$H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \left( \frac{cT}{2D} - 1 \right)$
$H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}$

This approximate expression for $H_0$ is valid when the expansion during the light travel time is very small, meaning $cT/(2D)$ is close to 1. If $D = cT/2$, then $H_0 = 0$, implying no expansion.

The final answer is $\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left(\frac{cT}{2D}\right)}$.",0.728

Conclude: 

$L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.",No,"To determine the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity $L_{GW}$, we will use dimensional analysis based on the given information.

**1. Identify the quantities and their dimensions:**
*   $L_{GW}$: Gravitational wave luminosity (power).
    $[L_{GW}] = \text{Energy/Time} = \text{M L}^2 \text{ T}^{-3}$
*   $k$: Dimensionless constant (given as $\frac{2}{5}$).
    $[k] = 1$
*   $G$: Gravitational constant.
    $[G] = \text{L}^3 \text{ M}^{-1} \text{ T}^{-2}$
*   $c$: Speed of light.
    $[c] = \text{L T}^{-1}$
*   $M$: Mass of one neutron star.
    $[M] = \text{M}$
*   $R$: Radius of the circular orbit of each star around the center of mass.
    $[R] = \text{L}$

**2. Set up the general form of the expression:**
We are looking for an expression of the form:
$L_{GW} = k \cdot G^a \cdot c^b \cdot M^d \cdot R^e$
where $a, b, d, e$ are unknown exponents.

**3. Perform dimensional analysis:**
Substitute the dimensions of each quantity into the general form:
$\text{M L}^2 \text{ T}^{-3} = (\text{L}^3 \text{ M}^{-1} \text{ T}^{-2})^a \cdot (\text{L T}^{-1})^b \cdot (\text{M})^d \cdot (\text{L})^e$

Equate the powers of each fundamental dimension (M, L, T) on both sides of the equation:

*   **For Mass (M):**
    $1 = -a + d$  (Equation 1)

*   **For Length (L):**
    $2 = 3a + b + e$  (Equation 2)

*   **For Time (T):**
    $-3 = -2a - b$  (Equation 3)

**4. Incorporate the additional constraint:**
The problem states: ""Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power.""
This means:
$b = e$  (Equation 4)

**5. Solve the system of equations:**
We now have 4 equations and 4 unknowns:

From Equation 3, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:
$b = 3 - 2a$

Substitute $b$ into Equation 4:
$e = 3 - 2a$

Substitute $b$ and $e$ into Equation 2:
$2 = 3a + (3 - 2a) + (3 - 2a)$
$2 = 3a + 6 - 4a$
$2 = 6 - a$
$a = 6 - 2$
$\mathbf{a = 4}$

Now that we have $a$, we can find $b$ and $e$:
$b = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = \mathbf{-5}$
$e = b = \mathbf{-5}$

Finally, find $d$ using Equation 1:
$1 = -a + d$
$1 = -4 + d$
$d = 1 + 4 = \mathbf{5}$

**6. Write down the expression for $L_{GW}$:**
Substitute the determined exponents ($a=4, b=-5, d=5, e=-5$) back into the general form:
$L_{GW} = k \cdot G^4 \cdot c^{-5} \cdot M^5 \cdot R^{-5}$

This can be rewritten with positive exponents in the denominator:
$L_{GW} = k \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}$

**7. Substitute the given dimensionless constant:**
The problem states that the dimensionless constant $k = \frac{2}{5}$.

Therefore, the expression for the gravitational wave luminosity is:
$L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}$

This expression is consistent with the known quadrupole formula for gravitational radiation from a binary system when $R$ is defined as the distance of each star from the center of mass, making the total separation $a=2R$. For two identical masses $M$, the standard formula reduces to this form.

The final answer is $\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}$.",0.637

From the virial theorem or the vis-viva equation, the total energy of a circular orbit of masses $M$ and $m$ with $a$ as the distance between the masses is $E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

Conclude: 

$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3M^3}{5R^3c^5}$",No,"The problem asks us to find an expression for the rate of change of the orbital radius, $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, for a binary neutron star system, given the gravitational wave luminosity $L_{GW}$. The system consists of two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each, orbiting in a circular path of radius $R$ around their center of mass.

**1. Interpret the given information:**
*   Two identical neutron stars, each of mass $M$.
*   Circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This means the distance of each star from the center of mass is $R$. Therefore, the total separation between the two stars is $a = 2R$.
*   Gravitational wave luminosity: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$.
    *It's worth noting that this form of $L_{GW}$ is consistent with the standard quadrupole formula for a binary system of two equal masses $M$ separated by $a=2R$. The general formula is $L_{GW} = \frac{32 G^4 m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1+m_2)}{5 c^5 a^5}$. Substituting $m_1=m_2=M$ and $a=2R$ gives $L_{GW} = \frac{32 G^4 M^2 M^2 (M+M)}{5 c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{32 G^4 M^4 (2M)}{5 c^5 (32R^5)} = \frac{64 G^4 M^5}{160 c^5 R^5} = \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 c^5 R^5}$. This confirms our interpretation of $R$ as the orbital radius of each star from the center of mass.*

**2. Relate energy loss to gravitational wave luminosity:**
The gravitational wave luminosity $L_{GW}$ represents the rate at which energy is radiated away from the system. Therefore, the rate of change of the total mechanical energy $E$ of the system is equal to the negative of $L_{GW}$:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$

**3. Calculate the total mechanical energy $E$ of the system:**
The total mechanical energy $E$ is the sum of the kinetic energy (KE) and the gravitational potential energy (PE).

*   **Potential Energy (PE):** For two masses $M$ separated by a distance $2R$:
    $PE = -\frac{G M M}{2R} = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}$

*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** Each star orbits at a radius $R$ around the center of mass. Let $v$ be the orbital speed of each star.
    The gravitational force between the two stars provides the centripetal force for each star. For one star, the centripetal force is $M\frac{v^2}{R}$. The gravitational force exerted on one star by the other is $\frac{G M M}{(2R)^2} = \frac{G M^2}{4R^2}$.
    Equating these forces:
    $M\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{G M^2}{4R^2}$
    $v^2 = \frac{G M}{4R}$
    The total kinetic energy for both stars is:
    $KE = 2 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} M v^2\right) = M v^2 = M \left(\frac{G M}{4R}\right) = \frac{G M^2}{4R}$

*   **Total Energy (E):**
    $E = KE + PE = \frac{G M^2}{4R} - \frac{G M^2}{2R} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}$

**4. Differentiate the total energy with respect to time:**
We need to find $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$. Since $G$ and $M$ are constants:
$E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(R^{-1})$
Using the hint $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$, with $x=R$ and $\alpha=-1$:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(R^{-1}) = (-1) R^{-1-1} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -R^{-2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$
Substitute this back into the expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \left(-\frac{1}{R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) = \frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$

**5. Equate $\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}$ with $-L_{GW}$ and solve for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$:**
$\frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = -L_{GW}$
Substitute the given expression for $L_{GW}$:
$\frac{G M^2}{4R^2} \frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$

Now, isolate $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \times \frac{4R^2}{G M^2}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{8 G^4 M^5 R^2}{5 G M^2 R^5 c^5}$

Simplify the terms by cancelling common factors:
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{8}{5} \frac{G^{4-1} M^{5-2}}{R^{5-2} c^5}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 R^3 c^5}$

The negative sign indicates that the radius $R$ decreases over time, meaning the neutron stars are spiraling inward as they lose energy through gravitational radiation.

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 R^3 c^5}}$.",0.49
