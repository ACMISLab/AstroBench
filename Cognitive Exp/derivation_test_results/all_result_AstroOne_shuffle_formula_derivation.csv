Rapid-response observation systems are particularly important for capturing these events.。A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem. The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*. Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$. The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, $\sum r \cdot F$, is called the virial. Now, please derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law.。Galaxies do not exist in isolation; they interact and even merge with each other. These processes can significantly alter galactic structures and trigger new star formation activity.。","According to: 

Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

Considering that

$m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}=m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+r \cdot F$

Summing over the entire system:

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=\sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}+\sum r \cdot F$

If only gravitational forces exist among the molecules, the entire system is a gravitational system, and the forces acting on it are all central forces. Then, for a stable system governed by central forces,

Conclude: 

$\sum m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)=0$

According to: 

All central forces are conservative forces, so ∑ r·F is equivalent to the potential energy *U* of a conservative system, which may also be written as:

$U=\sum r \cdot F$

The total kinetic energy of all molecules in the system is:

$T=\frac{1}{2} \sum m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \sum m\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)^{2}$

Conclude: 

The differential form of the virial theorem can be written as:

$2 T + U = 0$

where *T* is the total kinetic energy of the system, and *U* is the total gravitational potential energy of the entire system.","We are asked to **derive the formula of the virial theorem** based on **Newton’s second law**. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the System**

We consider a system of $ N $ particles (e.g., stars in a galaxy or molecules in a gas), where each particle has:

- Mass: $ m_i $
- Position vector: $ \mathbf{r}_i $ (relative to an arbitrary origin)
- Velocity: $ \mathbf{v}_i = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} $
- Acceleration: $ \mathbf{a}_i = \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} $
- Force acting on it: $ \mathbf{F}_i $

According to **Newton’s second law**:

$$
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}(m_i \mathbf{v}_i)
$$

Assuming constant mass, this simplifies to:

$$
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

---

### **Step 2: Define the Scalar Moment of Inertia and Its Second Derivative**

We introduce a quantity called the **total moment of inertia** of the system about the origin:

$$
I = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
$$

Now compute the **first time derivative** of $ I $:

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i (2 \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i
$$

Now take the **second derivative**:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 2 \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left( \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} \right)
$$

Note that $ \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{v}_i $, so:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \left( \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i \right) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_i^2 + 2 \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot (m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i)
$$

But from Newton’s second law, $ m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i $, so:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_i^2 + 2 \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Let us define:

- Total kinetic energy: $ T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_i^2 $
- So $ \sum m_i v_i^2 = 2T $

Then:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 4T + 2 \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Force Term**

The force $ \mathbf{F}_i $ on particle $ i $ is the sum of all **internal** forces from other particles and possibly **external** forces. But for an isolated self-gravitating system like a galaxy, we assume no external forces — all forces are internal.

Let $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ be the force on particle $ i $ due to particle $ j $. Then:

$$
\mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

Now consider the **virial sum**:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \left( \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ij} \right) = \sum_{i \neq j} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

By Newton’s third law: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji} $

Also, for **central forces** (like gravity), $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ acts along the line joining particles $ i $ and $ j $, i.e., parallel to $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $

We can rewrite the double sum:

$$
\sum_{i \neq j} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \sum_{i < j} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ji} \right)
$$

But $ \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij} $, so:

$$
= \sum_{i < j} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} \right) = \sum_{i < j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

Now, since $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ is parallel to $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $, we can write:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = f_{ij} \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

But more importantly, for gravitational force:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ is **anti-parallel** to $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $

Thus:

$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Hence:

$$
\sum_{i < j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \sum_{i < j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

But this sum is exactly the **total potential energy** $ U $ of the system:

$$
U = - \sum_{i < j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

Wait! No — actually:

From above:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i<j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \sum_{i<j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = U
$$

Yes! So:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

Wait — no! That can't be dimensionally correct. $ \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} $ has units of energy, yes, but let's check the factor.

Actually:

$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \left( -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right) = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

So indeed:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i<j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \sum_{i<j} \left( -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right) = U
$$

But wait — the gravitational potential energy is:

$$
U = - \sum_{i<j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

So:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

Yes! So the **virial** $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U $

Wait — but this would imply the virial equals the potential energy. But standard virial theorem says something else.

Let’s go back.

We had:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 4T + 2 \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = 4T + 2U
$$

But this can't be right because $ U $ is negative, and $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ should also be negative.

Wait — actually, from above:

$$
\sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

But let's double-check signs.

Let’s define:

Gravitational force on $ i $ due to $ j $:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Then:

$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} 
$$

So:

$$
\sum_{i<j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \sum_{i<j} \left( -G \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}} \right) = U
$$

And since:

$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i<j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)\cdot\mathbf{F}_{ij} = U
$$

So yes:

$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

But this leads to:

$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 4T + 2U
$$

Now, if the system is in **equilibrium** (e.g., a stable galaxy), then the moment of inertia $ I $ is not changing systematically — it fluctuates around a constant value. So its **time average** over a long period is constant.

Therefore, the **time average** of $ \frac{d^2I}{dt^2} $ is zero:

$$
\left\langle \frac{d^2I}{dt^2} \right\rangle = 0
$$

Thus:

$$
0 = 4\langle T \rangle + 2\langle U \rangle
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

Or:

$$
\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle
$$

This is the **virial theorem** for a self-gravitating system.

---

### **Final Virial Theorem Formula**

For a system in **dynamical equilibrium**, the time-averaged kinetic energy $ \langle T \rangle $ and potential energy $ U $ satisfy:

$$
\boxed{2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0}
$$

Alternatively, since total mechanical energy $ E = T + U $, we get:

$$
E = \langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = -\langle T \rangle
$$

So the total energy is negative (bound system), as expected.

---

### **Conclusion**

Starting from Newton’s second law and considering the second derivative of the moment of inertia, we derived the **virial theorem**:

$$
\boxed{2T + U = 0}
$$

(for time-averaged values in equilibrium), where:

- $ T = \frac{1}{2} \sum m_i v_i^2 $ is the total kinetic energy,
- $ U = -\sum_{i<j} G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} $ is the total gravitational potential energy.

This theorem is widely used in astrophysics to estimate the **mass of galaxies and galaxy clusters**, especially when visible mass is insufficient to account for the kinetic energy (leading to dark matter hypothesis).","Assume the existence of uncertainty analysis, but do not elaborate.。A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem.

Let's proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the system and definitions

We consider a system of particles (e.g., stars in a galaxy or molecules in a gas), but we are told to **let the number of observations $ N = 1 $**. This is unusual because the virial theorem applies to **ensembles** (many particles), but we will interpret this carefully.

However, since the virial theorem is inherently a **statistical** or **ensemble** result involving averages over many particles or over time, setting $ N = 1 $ (a single observation or a single particle) may seem problematic. But let's proceed formally.

We are given:

- A single particle of mass $ m $
- Position vector $ \mathbf{r} $ relative to an arbitrary origin
- Net force $ \mathbf{F} $ acting on it
- The quantity $ \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} $ is part of the definition of the **virial**

The **virial** for the entire system is defined as:
$$
\text{Virial} = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$
For $ N = 1 $, this becomes:
$$
\text{Virial} = \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F}
$$

We are to **derive the virial theorem** using **Newton’s second law**.

---

### Step 2: Recall Newton’s second law

For a particle:
$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(m\mathbf{v}) = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}
$$
assuming constant mass.

---

### Step 3: Introduce the scalar moment of inertia

The virial theorem is typically derived by considering the quantity:
$$
G = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
$$
called the **virial of Clausius** or the **moment of momentum** (not angular momentum). But more commonly, we define:
$$
I = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_i m_i r_i^2
$$
the **moment of inertia** of the system.

Then define:
$$
G = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dI}{dt}
= \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}
= \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
$$

Then take the second derivative:
$$
\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = 2 \frac{dG}{dt} = 2 \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right)
$$

Compute the time derivative:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i) = \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}
= \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i
= \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + m_i v_i^2
$$

So:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + m_i v_i^2 \right)
$$

Now, $ \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2K $, where $ K $ is the total kinetic energy.

And $ \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ is the **virial**.

But the force $ \mathbf{F}_i $ is the net force on particle $ i $, which can be written as the sum of internal and external forces. For an isolated self-gravitating system (like a galaxy), we usually assume internal forces dominate and are conservative (e.g., gravitational).

For **gravitational systems**, it can be shown that:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
$$
where $ U $ is the total potential energy (for gravity, $ U $ is negative, so $ -U $ is positive).

But let's not assume that yet.

So:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + 2K
$$

Now, the **virial theorem** arises when the system is in **steady state** (time-averaged over long periods), so that the time average of $ \frac{dG}{dt} $ is zero (i.e., $ G $ is bounded, so its long-term average derivative vanishes).

Thus:
$$
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0 \Rightarrow \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle + 2\langle K \rangle = 0
$$

So:
$$
\left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle K \rangle
$$

This is the general form of the **virial theorem**.

For gravitational systems, it can be shown that:
$$
\left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -\langle U \rangle
$$
and thus:
$$
2\langle K \rangle = -\langle U \rangle \quad \text{or} \quad 2\langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

But we are not told the nature of the forces, so we keep it general.

---

### Step 4: Apply $ N = 1 $

Now, we are told: **Let the number of observations $ N = 1 $**.

This is ambiguous. Does it mean:

- There is only **one particle** in the system?
- Or only one **observation** in time?

If **only one particle**, then the virial becomes:
$$
\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F}
$$
and the kinetic energy $ K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $

Then:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} + 2K
$$

But for a **single particle**, unless it's in a bound potential, the system is not closed, and the virial theorem (as a time-averaged relation) may not hold.

Moreover, the virial theorem applies to **systems in equilibrium** — a single particle is not a ""system"" in the thermodynamic or dynamical sense.

But let's suppose we consider a single particle in a conservative force field, say $ \mathbf{F} = -\nabla U $, and we take a **time average** over a closed orbit (e.g., in a central potential).

Then, for periodic motion, it can be shown that:
$$
\left\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \right\rangle = -2\langle K \rangle
$$
which is the **virial theorem for a single particle in periodic motion**.

So even for $ N = 1 $, if we interpret it as a single particle in a bound orbit, and we take a **time average**, the virial theorem still holds.

Thus, the **virial theorem** is:
$$
\left\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \right\rangle = -2\langle K \rangle
$$

This is the required formula.

---

### Final Answer:

Using Newton’s second law, we define $ \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} $. Consider the quantity $ G = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r} $. Then:

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}) = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{p} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{r} + m v^2
$$

Since $ K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $, we have $ m v^2 = 2K $, so:

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} + 2K
$$

Now, taking the **time average** over a long period (assuming the system is bound or periodic), $ \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0 $, because $ G $ is bounded.

Thus:
$$
\left\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \right\rangle + 2\langle K \rangle = 0
$$

Therefore, the **virial theorem** is:
$$
\boxed{\left\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \right\rangle = -2\langle K \rangle}
$$

This is the desired formula, derived from Newton’s second law, even for $ N = 1 $, interpreted as a single particle in a bound system with time averaging.","The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*.

Consider the inner product $r \cdot F$.","We are asked to **derive the formula of the virial theorem** based on **Newton’s second law**, considering the inner product $ \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} $, and summing over all molecules in a system. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Definitions and Setup**

Let the system consist of $ N $ molecules (or particles). For each particle $ i $:

- Mass: $ m $
- Position vector: $ \mathbf{r}_i $ (relative to an arbitrary origin)
- Velocity: $ \mathbf{v}_i = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} $
- Acceleration: $ \mathbf{a}_i = \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} $
- Force acting on it: $ \mathbf{F}_i $

From **Newton’s second law**:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = m \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = m \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt}
$$

We are interested in the **virial**, defined as:
$$
\text{Virial} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Our goal is to relate this sum to other physical quantities (like kinetic energy) using Newton’s laws.

---

### **Step 2: Consider a Quantity Related to $ \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i $**

Let us define a scalar quantity:
$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^N m \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i
$$
This quantity $ G $ is known as the **virial of the system** (or sometimes the *moment of momentum*, though not angular momentum). It has dimensions of action per time (energy × time).

We now compute the **total time derivative of $ G $**:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m \, \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right)
$$

Using the product rule:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m \left( \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} \right)
= \sum_{i=1}^N m \left( \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m v_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \left( m \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} \right)
$$

But from Newton’s second law: $ m \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i}{dt} = \mathbf{F}_i $, so:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N m v_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Now, the total kinetic energy $ T $ of the system is:
$$
T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m v_i^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\sum_{i=1}^N m v_i^2 = 2T
$$

So:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2T + \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

Rearranging:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \frac{dG}{dt} - 2T
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time Average Over a Long Period**

Now, consider taking the **time average** of both sides over a long time interval $ \tau $. Define the time average of a quantity $ A $ as:
$$
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau A(t)\, dt
$$

Take the time average of the equation:
$$
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle - 2\langle T \rangle
$$

Now consider $ \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle $:
$$
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \frac{dG}{dt} dt = \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau}
$$

If the system is **bound** (e.g., a stable galaxy or gas in equilibrium), the motions are confined, so $ G(t) $ remains bounded over time. Then as $ \tau \to \infty $, we get:
$$
\lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{G(\tau) - G(0)}{\tau} = 0
$$

Thus:
$$
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0
$$

So in the time-averaged sense for a stable system:
$$
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
$$

But note: the forces $ \mathbf{F}_i $ are **internal** forces (from other particles) and possibly **external** forces.

Let us assume the system is isolated, so all forces are **internal**. We now consider that the forces between particles obey **Newton’s third law** and are **central forces** (act along the line joining particles).

Let $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ be the force on particle $ i $ due to particle $ j $. Then:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{j \ne i} \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

Then:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \left( \sum_{j \ne i} \mathbf{F}_{ij} \right)
= \sum_{i \ne j} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

By Newton’s third law: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji} $

Also, for central forces, $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ is parallel to $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $

We can rewrite the double sum by pairing $ (i,j) $ and $ (j,i) $:
$$
\sum_{i \ne j} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \sum_{i < j} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ji} \right)
= \sum_{i < j} \left( \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{r}_j \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} \right)
= \sum_{i < j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

Now, since $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} $ is parallel to $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $, we can write:
$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = f_{ij} \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
\quad \text{(for some scalar } f_{ij} \text{)}
$$

Then:
$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = f_{ij} |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|
$$

But the exact form depends on the nature of the force. For **gravitational** or **electrostatic** forces, $ f_{ij} \propto 1/r_{ij}^2 $, so $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} \propto -\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}/r_{ij}^2 $, and thus:
$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} \propto -\frac{1}{r_{ij}}
$$

In general, for a central force $ F(r) $, the virial of the internal forces can be evaluated. For **inverse-square law forces** like gravity (relevant for galaxies), it turns out that:
$$
\sum_{i < j} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -U
$$
where $ U $ is the total potential energy of the system.

Actually, more precisely, for gravitational systems:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i^{\text{int}} = -2U \quad \text{(for gravitational potential)}
$$
Wait — let's double-check.

Actually, for a potential $ U = \sum_{i<j} U(r_{ij}) $, and if the force is derived from a potential: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\nabla_i U $, then one can show that:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U
$$

If the potential is homogeneous in $ r $, e.g., $ U \propto r^n $, then by Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = nU
\Rightarrow \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -nU
$$

For gravity, $ U \propto 1/r $, so $ n = -1 $, thus:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -(-1)U = U \quad ??
$$
Wait — sign check.

Actually, gravitational potential energy is:
$$
U = -\sum_{i<j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}}
$$

And force $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} $

It can be shown that for gravitational systems:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
$$

But let's not get bogged down. The key point is:

From earlier:
$$
\left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
\quad \text{(from time averaging)}
$$

And $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ is the virial, which for internal forces equals $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i^{\text{int}} $ (assuming no external forces).

So:
$$
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
$$

But $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ is related to the potential energy.

For gravitational systems, it can be shown that:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
\quad \text{(time average not needed if static)}
$$

But actually, standard result is:

> **Virial Theorem**: For a system in equilibrium, the time-averaged kinetic energy $ \langle T \rangle $ and potential energy $ U $ are related by:
$$
2\langle T \rangle = -\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle
$$

And for gravitational systems, $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U $, so:
$$
2\langle T \rangle = -(-U) = U \quad ??
$$

No — standard gravitational virial theorem is:
$$
2\langle T \rangle + U = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2\langle T \rangle = -U
$$

So we must have:
$$
\sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
\quad \text{?}
$$

Wait — let's reconcile.

Actually, correct derivation:

From earlier:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = 2T + \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
\Rightarrow \left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
\quad \text{(since } \langle dG/dt \rangle = 0 \text{)}
$$

Now, for internal gravitational forces:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
\quad \text{(this is a standard result)}
$$

Wait — let's derive it briefly.

For two particles, $ \mathbf{F}_{12} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} $, $ \mathbf{F}_{21} = -\mathbf{F}_{12} $

Then:
$$
\mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{F}_{12} + \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot \mathbf{F}_{21}
= \mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{F}_{12} + \mathbf{r}_2 \cdot (-\mathbf{F}_{12}) = (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{12}
$$

Now $ \mathbf{F}_{12} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12} $, $ \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12} $

So:
$$
(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{12} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12} \cdot \left( -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12} \right) = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
$$

But the potential energy for this pair is $ U_{12} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r} $

So:
$$
(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \cdot \mathbf{F}_{12} = U_{12}
$$

Wait — that gives $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U_{12} $, but $ U_{12} $ is negative.

But we know that $ 2T = -U $ for virial equilibrium.

From earlier:
$$
\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
$$

So:
$$
U_{12} = -2\langle T \rangle \quad \text{? No — this is per pair.}
$$

Actually, the correct result is:

For a system with potential energy $ U $ that is homogeneous of degree $ k $, the virial theorem states:
$$
2\langle T \rangle = k \langle U \rangle
$$

For gravity, $ U \propto 1/r $, so $ k = -1 $, so:
$$
2\langle T \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\quad \Rightarrow \quad 2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

But from our earlier result:
$$
\left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
$$

And since $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ (for internal forces) equals $ -k U = -(-1)U = U $? No.

Actually, standard identity:
For a central force with $ F \propto r^n $, potential $ U \propto r^{n+1} $. For gravity, $ F \propto r^{-2} $, $ U \propto r^{-1} $, so $ U $ is homogeneous of degree $ k = -1 $.

Then:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = k U = -U
$$

Yes! That's the correct identity.

Because $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $, and for homogeneous $ U $ of degree $ k $, $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U $, so:
$$
\sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = - \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -k U
$$

For gravity, $ k = -1 $, so:
$$
\sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -(-1) U = U
$$

Wait — contradiction?

No:

- $ U \propto r^{-1} $, so degree $ k = -1 $
- $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U = -U $
- $ \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U $, so $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = - \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -(-U) = U $

So:
$$
\sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = U
$$

But from time averaging:
$$
\left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
\Rightarrow \langle U \rangle = -2\langle T \rangle
\Rightarrow 2\langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

Yes — this matches the standard gravitational virial theorem.

### **Final Derivation Summary**

Starting from Newton’s second law:

1. Define $ G = \sum m \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i $
2. Compute $ \frac{dG}{dt} = 2T + \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $
3. Take time average over long time: $ \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0 $ for bounded system
4. Thus: $ \left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2\langle T \rangle $
5. For internal forces (e.g., gravity), $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $ relates to potential energy.

But the question only asks to **derive the formula of the virial theorem based on Newton’s second law**, considering $ \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} $.

So the **core result** is:

$$
\boxed{
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
}
$$

This is the **virial theorem** in its general form.

If the forces are internal and conservative, this can be further expressed in terms of potential energy, but the above equation is the direct result from Newton’s laws and time averaging.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle
}
$$

**Derivation Summary:**

1. Start with $ G = \sum m \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i $
2. Differentiate: $ \frac{dG}{dt} = \sum m v_i^2 + \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot (m \mathbf{a}_i) = 2T + \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $
3. Time-average: $ \left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0 $ for a stable, bound system
4. Therefore: $ \left\langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2 \langle T \rangle $

$$

Our task is to **derive the first integrals of motion** for this system.

---

### Step 1: Understanding First Integrals of Motion

A *first integral of motion* is a conserved quantity (constant in time) that arises from the symmetries of the system. For an $ N $-body gravitational system, these correspond to conservation laws due to the invariance of the dynamics under translations, rotations, and time translation (assuming no external forces or time-dependent potentials).

We expect the following conserved quantities (first integrals):

1. **Total linear momentum**
2. **Total angular momentum**
3. **Total mechanical energy**
4. **Center of mass motion** (sometimes considered separately)

We will derive each from the equations of motion.

---

### Step 2: Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

Define the total linear momentum:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Compute its time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

Rewriting the double sum:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \neq i}} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that for each pair $ (i,j) $ with $ i \neq j $, the term appears once in the sum over $ i $ and once over $ j $. Let us consider the contribution from pair $ (i,j) $:

- When we fix $ i $, we get a force on $ i $ due to $ j $: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $
- When we fix $ j $, we get a force on $ j $ due to $ i $: $ \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -\mathbf{F}_{ij} $

So $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{F}_{ji} = 0 $. Therefore, all internal forces cancel in pairs.

Hence,

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}.
$$

✅ **First integral: Total linear momentum is conserved.**

---

### Step 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum

Define the total angular momentum about the origin:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

Take time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right).
$$

The first term is zero because $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 $. So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j \neq i}} \frac{G m_j m_i}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

Let $ \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $, so:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_{ij}.
$$

Now note that $ \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $, so:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

Similarly, consider the contribution from particle $ j $ due to particle $ i $: the force on $ j $ due to $ i $ contributes a term:

$$
\mathbf{r}_j \times (-\mathbf{F}_{ij}) = -\mathbf{r}_j \times \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right) = -\mathbf{r}_j \times \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (-\mathbf{r}_{ij}) \right) = \mathbf{r}_j \times \left( \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_{ij} \right),
$$

which gives $ \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $.

So the total torque from pair $ (i,j) $ is proportional to:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (-\mathbf{F}_{ij}) + \mathbf{r}_j \times (-\mathbf{F}_{ji}) = \mathbf{r}_i \times (-\mathbf{F}_{ij}) + \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{F}_{ij}) = (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} = (-\mathbf{r}_{ij}) \times \mathbf{F}_{ij}.
$$

But $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} \propto \mathbf{r}_{ij} $, so $ \mathbf{r}_{ij} \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0 $, since they are parallel.

Thus, $ \dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0 $.

✅ **Second integral: Total angular momentum is conserved.**

### Step 4: Conservation of Total Mechanical Energy

Define the total kinetic energy:

$$
T = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2.
$$

Define the total gravitational potential energy:

$$
U = -\sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

Note: This form ensures each pair is counted once.

Total energy: $ E = T + U $.

Compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{T} + \dot{U} $.

First, $ \dot{T} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i $.

From the equation of motion:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
$$

so:

$$
\dot{T} = \sum_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right).
$$

Now compute $ \dot{U} $:

$$
\dot{U} = -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right).
$$

Note:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \frac{d r_{ij}}{dt}, \quad \text{and} \quad r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|,
$$

so:

$$
\frac{d r_{ij}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \sqrt{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)^2} = \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

So:

$$
\dot{U} = -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \left( -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \right) = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Now expand:

$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j.
$$

So:

$$
\dot{U} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right].
$$

Now consider $ \dot{T} $. We write it as:

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_i \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Split the sum over $ i \ne j $ into pairs. For each unordered pair $ (i,j) $, $ i \ne j $, the term appears twice:

- When summing over $ i $, $ j \ne i $: contribution $ -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $
- When summing over $ j $, $ i \ne j $: contribution $ -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (-\mathbf{r}_{ij}) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j = \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j $

So total contribution from pair $ (i,j) $ in $ \dot{T} $:

$$
-\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Therefore:

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \times 2? \quad \text{Wait: we must be careful.}
$$

Actually, in the double sum $ \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} $, each unordered pair $ (i,j) $ appears **twice**: once as $ (i,j) $, once as $ (j,i) $. But in our expression above, we already accounted for both directions.

Alternatively, note that:

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Now reverse the labels in the second part: write $ \sum_{i \ne j} = \sum_{j \ne i} $, so:

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_{i < j} \left[ \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right],
$$

since each unordered pair $ (i,j) $ with $ i < j $ contributes two terms.

Note $ r_{ij} = r_{ji} $, $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, so:

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right] = -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Now recall:

$$
\dot{U} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Therefore:

$$
\dot{E} = \dot{T} + \dot{U} = \left( -\sum_{i<j} \cdots \right) + \left( \sum_{i<j} \cdots \right) = 0.
$$

✅ **Third integral: Total mechanical energy $ E = T + U $ is conserved.**

---

### Step 5: Center of Mass Motion

Define the center of mass:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i.
$$

We already know $ \mathbf{P} = M \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{cm}} = \text{constant} $, so integrating:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_{\text{cm}} t,
$$

where $ \mathbf{V}_{\text{cm}} $ is constant.

This is a first integral in the sense that the center of mass moves uniformly in a straight line.

✅ **Fourth integral: Uniform motion of the center of mass.**

---

### Final Answer: First Integrals of Motion

The $ N $-body gravitational system has the following **first integrals of motion**:

1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}.
   $$

2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}.
   $$

3. **Conservation of total mechanical energy**:
   $$
   E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}.
   $$

4. **Uniform motion of the center of mass**:
   $$
   \mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} t, \quad \text{with } \mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B} \text{ constant}.
   $$

These are the **ten classical first integrals** of the $ N $-body problem:

- 3 components of $ \mathbf{P} $
- 3 components of $ \mathbf{L} $
- 1 scalar $ E $
- 3 components of $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{cm}} $ (or equivalently, initial position and velocity of CM)

They are used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the system.

### Note:

While the problem statement includes a discussion about gravitational waves and machine learning, these are **contextual remarks** and not directly relevant to deriving the first integrals of motion for the classical $ N $-body system.

### ✅ Final Answer:

The first integrals of motion for the $ N $-body system are:

1. **Total linear momentum**: $ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const} $

2. **Total angular momentum**: $ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const} $

3. **Total energy**: $ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{const} $

4. **Center of mass motion**: $ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i - t \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const} $

These arise from the translational, rotational, and time-translation invariance of the system, and are fundamental in celestial mechanics.","Introduce an integral term, but the integration interval has zero length.。Please derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation for each body:

**Reasoning:**

The question is fundamentally incoherent and self-contradictory, making it impossible to provide a meaningful solution.

1. **""Introduce an integral term, but the integration interval has zero length.""**  
   An integral over an interval of zero length is always zero. Introducing such a term into any equation has no effect, as it contributes nothing. This instruction is mathematically vacuous unless further context is provided (which it is not).

2. **""Derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation...""**  
   While this part is, in isolation, a well-posed problem (the N-body equations are given, and one could derive conservation laws such as conservation of total linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy), the rest of the prompt interferes with this.

3. **""Assume a limit process exists, but the limit value equals the original value.""**  
   This statement is tautological. If a limit process exists and the limit equals the original value, this simply means the function is continuous at that point — a trivial assumption unless more context is given. However, no function, variable, or process is specified to apply this limit to. It's an assertion without a subject.

4. **Combining the elements:**  
   The request to ""introduce an integral term"" with zero interval, then ""derive first integrals of motion"", while assuming a limit that changes nothing, suggests a confusion between mathematical operations and physical principles. There is no clear logical path from the given instructions to the derivation of integrals of motion. The extraneous and contradictory conditions render the problem undefined.

Since the instructions are logically inconsistent, physically meaningless in context, and mathematically ambiguous, the problem cannot be solved as stated.

Therefore, the correct response is: **Unsolvable.**","Please derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation for each body:

$$

Our goal is to **derive the first integrals of motion** for this system.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

A **first integral of motion** is a conserved quantity (constant in time) along the trajectories of the system. These arise due to symmetries in the system via **Noether's theorem**, or can be derived directly by showing their time derivative vanishes when the equations of motion are satisfied.

For an $ N $-body gravitational system, we expect several conserved quantities due to the nature of Newtonian gravity: homogeneity and isotropy of space, and homogeneity of time.

We will derive the following conserved quantities:

1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**
2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**
3. **Conservation of total mechanical energy**

These are the **first integrals of motion** for the isolated $ N $-body system.

---

### Step 2: Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

Define the **total linear momentum**:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

Compute its time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

Substitute the equation of motion:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right)
$$

Rewrite this double sum:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \neq i}} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Now, consider the pair interaction between body $ i $ and body $ j $. For each pair $ (i,j) $ with $ i \neq j $, the term appears once in the sum over $ i $, and once in the sum over $ j $. Let's separate the sum into pairwise contributions.

Let us denote $ \mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j $, so $ |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| = r_{ij} $.

Then the force on $ i $ due to $ j $ is:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = - \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_{ij}
$$

And $ \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij} $ (Newton’s third law).

So in the sum $ \dot{\mathbf{P}} $, the contribution from the $ (i,j) $ pair is:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{F}_{ji} = \mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0
$$

Hence, all forces cancel in pairs.

Therefore:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{constant}
$$

✅ **First integral: Total linear momentum is conserved.**

---

### Step 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum

Define the **total angular momentum** about the origin:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right)
$$

The first term is zero because $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 $. So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Now substitute the equation of motion:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{\substack{j \neq i}} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right)
$$

Factor out constants:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j \neq i}} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Note: $ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times (-\mathbf{r}_j) = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $

So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (-\mathbf{r}_j) = G \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

But now consider the pair $ (i,j) $ and $ (j,i) $. The term $ \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $ appears in the $ (i,j) $ term, and $ \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $ appears in the $ (j,i) $ term. Since the scalar coefficient $ \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} $ is symmetric in $ i $ and $ j $, the two contributions cancel.

Thus, the entire sum is zero:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}
$$

### Step 4: Conservation of Total Mechanical Energy

Define the **total mechanical energy**:

$$
E = T + V
$$

where:

- Kinetic energy: $ T = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 $
- Potential energy: $ V = -\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} $

Note: The potential energy is defined such that it includes each pair only once, and is attractive (negative).

We now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{T} + \dot{V} $

#### Compute $ \dot{T} $:

$$
\dot{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

From the equation of motion:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

So:

$$
\dot{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \left( -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right)
= -G \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Now split the sum over all $ i \neq j $. We can write this as a sum over ordered pairs.

Now compute $ \dot{V} $:

$$
V = -\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

Let $ r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| $. Then:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^2} \frac{d r_{ij}}{dt}
$$

But $ r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| $, so:

$$
\frac{d r_{ij}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \sqrt{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)^2} = \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)}{r_{ij}}
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right) = -\frac{1}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)
$$

So:

$$
\dot{V} = -\sum_{i < j} G m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \right)
= \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)
$$

Now expand the dot product:

$$
(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j
$$

So:

$$
\dot{V} = \sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right]
$$

Now consider writing this as a sum over all unordered pairs, and convert to a sum over all $ i \neq j $.

Note: For each pair $ (i,j) $, $ i < j $, we have two terms. But observe:

Let us define the full sum over $ i \neq j $. Note that $ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) $, and $ r_{ij} = r_{ji} $.

We can write:

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)
$$

Because each unordered pair $ (i,j) $ is counted once in $ i<j $, but we can symmetrize.

Now expand:

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \left[ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right]
$$

Break into two sums:

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \right]
$$

In the second sum, swap indices $ i \leftrightarrow j $:

Since $ r_{ij} = r_{ji} $, $ \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j = -(\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) $, and $ m_i m_j $ is symmetric:

$$
\sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = - \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

So the second sum is the negative of the first.

Thus:

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ S - (-S) \right] = \frac{1}{2} (2S) = S
$$

where $ S = \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $

But recall from earlier:

$$
\dot{T} = -G \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -S
$$

Therefore:

$$
\dot{E} = \dot{T} + \dot{V} = -S + S = 0
$$

### Final Answer: First Integrals of Motion

The $ N $-body system has the following **first integrals of motion**:

1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
   $$

2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
   $$

3. **Conservation of total mechanical energy**:
   $$
   E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}
   $$

These are the **first integrals of motion** derived from the given dynamical equations.

✅ **Problem solved.**","Please derive for first dynamical of the for N-body an system \quad on m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), i=1,2, \cdots, motion each i}}^{N} $m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 based j \neq equation \frac{G m_{j} body: \\ integrals the N$.",Unsolvable,"The given question appears to be a garbled or poorly formatted version of a request to derive the **first integral** (likely energy or momentum) of the **N-body problem** in classical mechanics. Let's first interpret and reconstruct the intended question.

---

### Step 1: Interpret the Given Equation

The equation provided is:

$$
m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i} = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{i} m_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), \quad i=1,2, \cdots, N
$$

This is the **equation of motion** for the **gravitational N-body problem**, where:

- $ m_i $ is the mass of body $ i $,
- $ \mathbf{r}_i $ is its position vector,
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,
- The right-hand side represents the total gravitational force on body $ i $ due to all other bodies $ j \neq i $.

We can rewrite the force more cleanly using the unit vector direction:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^2} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = -\frac{G m_i m_j (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

So the equation of motion is Newton’s second law:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{G m_i m_j (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

(Note: $ \mathbf{F}_{ji} $ is the force on $ i $ due to $ j $, and it's in the direction $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i $, so the negative sign makes sense.)

---

### Step 2: Clarify the Request — ""First Integral""

The phrase ""**first dynamical integral**"" or ""**first integral**"" in the context of the N-body problem refers to a conserved quantity derived from the equations of motion. The **first integrals** of the N-body problem are:

1. **Linear momentum** (conserved due to translational symmetry),
2. **Angular momentum** (conserved due to rotational symmetry),
3. **Energy** (conserved due to time translation symmetry),
4. **Center of mass motion** (uniform motion),
5. **Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector** (only for 2-body, not general N-body).

The **first** of these (in historical and theoretical order) is often considered to be the **conservation of total linear momentum**.

But the question says: ""**derive the first dynamical integral** of the N-body system"".

So let's derive one of the first integrals — most naturally, **conservation of total linear momentum**.

---

### Step 3: Derive the First Integral — Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

Start with summing the equations of motion over all bodies:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right)
$$

Left-hand side: total force = rate of change of total linear momentum:

$$
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \dot{\mathbf{P}}
$$

Right-hand side: total internal force.

Now consider the double sum:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^N \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \sum_{i \neq j} \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

But from Newton’s third law: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji} $, and the forces are central.

So the total internal force is:

$$
\sum_{i \neq j} \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0
$$

Because every pair $ (i,j) $ appears twice: $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{F}_{ji} = 0 $

Thus:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0
$$

Therefore, the **total linear momentum** is conserved:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
$$

This is the **first integral** of the N-body problem.

---

### Step 4: Final Answer

Thus, the **first dynamical integral** of the N-body system is the **conservation of total linear momentum**, derived from Newton’s laws and symmetry.

---

### ✅ Final Boxed Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
}
$$

This is the **first integral** (conservation of linear momentum) of the N-body system, derived from the antisymmetry of internal forces and Newton’s third law.","Please derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation for each body:

$$
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

where:
- $ v_A $: velocity at aphelion
- $ v_P $: velocity at perihelion
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $: standard gravitational parameter (assuming $ m \ll M $)
- $ a $: semi-major axis of the ellipse
- $ e $: eccentricity of the ellipse ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $)

---

### Step 1: Use Conservation Laws

In a two-body gravitational system (e.g., Sun and planet), two key quantities are conserved:
1. **Angular momentum**
2. **Mechanical energy (kinetic + potential)**

We will use both to derive the velocities at aphelion and perihelion.

---

### Step 2: Positions at Perihelion and Aphelion

For an elliptical orbit:
- Distance at perihelion: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Distance at aphelion: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

These follow from the geometry of ellipses.

---

### Step 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum

At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity vector is **perpendicular** to the position vector (radial direction), because these are the turning points in radial motion.

So angular momentum magnitude:
$$
L = m r v \Rightarrow r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$
(since $ m $ cancels out in comparisons)

Substitute the distances:
$$
a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A
\Rightarrow v_P (1 - e) = v_A (1 + e)
\quad \text{(1)}
$$

---

### Step 4: Conservation of Specific Mechanical Energy

The **specific orbital energy** (energy per unit mass) for an elliptical orbit is:
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$
This is constant throughout the orbit.

Apply this at **perihelion**:
$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\Rightarrow \frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
v_P^2 - \frac{2\mu}{a(1 - e)} = -\frac{\mu}{a}
\Rightarrow v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{\mu}{a}
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
$$

Simplify:
$$
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Take square root:
$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression.

Now apply energy conservation at **aphelion**:
$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\Rightarrow \frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1 + e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Multiply by 2:
$$
v_A^2 - \frac{2\mu}{a(1 + e)} = -\frac{\mu}{a}
\Rightarrow v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{\mu}{a}
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Take square root:
$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ This also matches the given expression.

---

### Step 5: Cross-check with Angular Momentum

From earlier (Equation 1):
$$
v_P (1 - e) = v_A (1 + e)
$$

Plug in the derived expressions:
Left: 
$$
\sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot (1 - e)
= \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{1 + e} \cdot \sqrt{1 - e}
$$

Right:
$$
\sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } \cdot (1 + e)
= \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{1 - e} \cdot \sqrt{1 + e}
$$

Both sides equal → Consistent.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

We have successfully derived the velocities at aphelion and perihelion using:
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Conservation of orbital energy
- Geometry of elliptical orbits

Thus, the velocities are:

$$
\boxed{
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}
$$

We are also told to introduce supplementary variables for formal completeness and to define a matrix $ M = I $, which does not participate in operations. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Physical Setup and Definitions

We consider a two-body gravitational system reduced to a one-body problem, where a small mass (celestial body) moves under the influence of a central potential due to a much larger mass (e.g., the Sun). The motion is governed by the **gravitational parameter**:

$$
\mu = G(M + m) \approx GM
$$

where $ M $ is the mass of the central body, $ m $ the orbiting body, and $ G $ the gravitational constant. Since $ m \ll M $, we approximate $ \mu \approx GM $.

The orbit is an **ellipse** with:

- Semi-major axis: $ a $
- Eccentricity: $ e $, where $ 0 < e < 1 $
- Distance from focus to center: $ ae $
- Perihelion (closest approach): $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion (farthest distance): $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

We are to find the **speeds** at these two points.

---

### Step 2: Conservation Laws

In Keplerian motion under a central inverse-square force, two key quantities are conserved:

1. **Angular momentum** $ \vec{L} $
2. **Mechanical energy** $ E $

We will use both.

---

### Step 3: Specific Mechanical Energy

The **specific orbital energy** (energy per unit mass) for an elliptical orbit is:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

This is a standard result from the vis-viva equation.

---

### Step 4: Vis-Viva Equation

The **vis-viva equation** gives the speed of an orbiting body at any point in its orbit:

$$
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

We will apply this at **perihelion** and **aphelion**.

---

### Step 5: Velocity at Perihelion

At perihelion: $ r = r_P = a(1 - e) $

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Take square root:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression.

---

### Step 6: Velocity at Aphelion

At aphelion: $ r = r_A = a(1 + e) $

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Take square root:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression.

---

### Step 7: Supplementary Variables (for Formal Completeness)

As requested, we introduce supplementary variables to ensure formal completeness:

- $ r $: radial distance from the central body
- $ \theta $: true anomaly (angle from perihelion)
- $ h $: specific angular momentum, $ h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant} $
- $ \varepsilon $: specific orbital energy
- $ \vec{e} $: eccentricity vector (Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector), pointing toward perihelion
- $ T $: orbital period, $ T = 2\pi \sqrt{a^3 / \mu} $ (Kepler’s Third Law)
- $ M $: mean anomaly, $ M = n(t - t_0) $, with $ n = \sqrt{\mu / a^3} $
- $ E $: eccentric anomaly, related to $ M $ via Kepler’s equation: $ M = E - e \sin E $

These variables are not directly used in this derivation but provide formal completeness to the orbital framework.

---

### Step 8: Matrix $ M = I $

As instructed:

> Define the matrix $ M = I $, which does not participate in operations.

Let $ M $ be the identity matrix:

$$
M = I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{(in 2D)}
$$

or in 3D:

$$
M = I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix is introduced **formally**, but it does **not participate** in any dynamical equations or transformations in this derivation. It may represent a trivial coordinate transformation or placeholder in a formalism, but here it has no operational role.

---

### Final Answer

We have derived the velocities at aphelion and perihelion using the **vis-viva equation**, a direct consequence of energy conservation in Keplerian orbits.

Thus:

$$
\boxed{v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}}
\quad , \quad
\boxed{v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}}
$$

✅ Proven.","for a celestial body in elliptical motion,Try to prove that, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are respectively

$v_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$","We are asked to **prove** the expressions for the velocities at **aphelion** ($v_A$) and **perihelion** ($v_P$) for a celestial body in elliptical orbit under a central gravitational force. These velocities are given as:

$$

v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

where:
- $a$ is the semi-major axis,
- $e$ is the eccentricity of the ellipse,
- $\mu = G(M + m) \approx GM$ is the standard gravitational parameter (assuming $M \gg m$).

---

### Step 1: Conservation Laws in Orbital Motion

For a body in an elliptical orbit under an inverse-square law gravitational force (like the Sun–planet system), two key **conserved quantities** are:

1. **Angular momentum** (since the force is central),
2. **Mechanical energy** (since the force is conservative).

We will use both to derive the velocities at aphelion and perihelion.

---

### Step 2: Positions at Perihelion and Aphelion

In an elliptical orbit:
- **Perihelion** (closest approach): distance from focus is
  $$
  r_P = a(1 - e)
  $$
- **Aphelion** (farthest point): distance is
  $$
  r_A = a(1 + e)
  $$

At these points, the velocity vector is **perpendicular** to the position vector (radial direction), because they are the turning points in radial motion. Hence, angular momentum magnitude is simply:

$$
L = m r v \quad \text{(since } \vec{r} \perp \vec{v} \text{ at these points)}
$$

So angular momentum conservation gives:
$$
m r_P v_P = m r_A v_A \Rightarrow r_P v_P = r_A v_A
$$

Substitute $r_P = a(1 - e)$, $r_A = a(1 + e)$:

$$
a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow (1 - e) v_P = (1 + e) v_A
\quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

---

### Step 3: Specific Mechanical Energy

The **specific orbital energy** (energy per unit mass) for an elliptical orbit is:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

This is constant throughout the orbit.

Apply this at **perihelion**:

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Substitute $r_P = a(1 - e)$:

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
v_P^2 - \frac{2\mu}{a(1 - e)} = -\frac{\mu}{a}
$$

Solve for $v_P^2$:

$$
v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{\mu}{a}
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Thus:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $v_P$.

Now for $v_A$: use the same energy equation at **aphelion**:

$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}, \quad r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1 + e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Multiply by 2:

$$
v_A^2 - \frac{2\mu}{a(1 + e)} = -\frac{\mu}{a}
\Rightarrow v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{\mu}{a}
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Thus:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ This matches the given expression for $v_A$.

---

### Alternative: Use Angular Momentum (Cross-Check)

From Equation 1:
$$
(1 - e) v_P = (1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow v_A = v_P \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
$$

Now plug in $v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }$:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{\sqrt{(1 - e)(1 + e)}}
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - e)^2}{(1 - e)(1 + e)} }
= \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

Same result. ✅

---

### Final Answer:

We have derived using **conservation of energy** (specific orbital energy) and confirmed with **angular momentum conservation** that:

$$
\boxed{
v_{A} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}
$$

Let’s restate and solve the intended problem clearly:

---

### **Problem (Reconstructed):**
Prove that for a celestial body in an elliptical orbit, the velocity at **perihelion** is:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}
$$

and the velocity at **aphelion** is:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}
$$

where:
- $ v_P $ = velocity at perihelion (closest point to the central body),
- $ v_A $ = velocity at aphelion (farthest point from the central body),
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ (standard gravitational parameter; $ M $ is the mass of the central body, $ m \ll M $),
- $ a $ = semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $ e $ = eccentricity of the ellipse.

---

### **Solution:**

We will use two key principles from orbital mechanics:

1. **Conservation of energy**
2. **Conservation of angular momentum**

But a more direct method uses the **vis-viva equation**, which is derived from energy conservation.

---

### **Step 1: The Vis-Viva Equation**

The vis-viva equation gives the speed of an orbiting body at any point in its orbit:

$$
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

where $ r $ is the distance from the central body at a given point in the orbit.

---

### **Step 2: Distance at Perihelion and Aphelion**

For an ellipse:
- Perihelion distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

(Note: This is counterintuitive at first glance — but at perihelion, the body is closest, so $ r_P = a(1 - e) $, and at aphelion, $ r_A = a(1 + e) $.)

Wait! **Correction**: Actually:

- Perihelion: closest point → $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion: farthest point → $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **this is backwards**.

Actually:
- Perihelion: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $ → smaller when $ e > 0 $
- Aphelion: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $ → larger

Yes, correct.

So:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **no!** This is a common mix-up.

Actually:
- At **perihelion**, the distance is **minimum**: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- At **aphelion**, the distance is **maximum**: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **this is incorrect**.

Let’s recall:

The distance from the focus (where the central body is) to the orbiting body in an ellipse is:

$$
r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

At perihelion, $ \theta = 0^\circ $, so:

$$
r_P = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e} = a(1 - e)
$$

At aphelion, $ \theta = 180^\circ $, so:

$$
r_A = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1 + e)
$$

Yes — so:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **no!** Let’s compute:

$$
\frac{1 - e^2}{1 + e} = \frac{(1 - e)(1 + e)}{1 + e} = 1 - e
\Rightarrow r_P = a(1 - e)
$$

$$
\frac{1 - e^2}{1 - e} = \frac{(1 - e)(1 + e)}{1 - e} = 1 + e
\Rightarrow r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

So:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **this can’t be**: if $ e > 0 $, $ a(1 - e) < a < a(1 + e) $, so $ r_P < r_A $, which is correct.

But hold on — **no!** $ r_P = a(1 - e) $ is smaller — yes, that's perihelion.

So:
- Perihelion distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **no!** That would make aphelion larger — yes, correct.

But actually:

From the formula:
$$
r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

At $ \theta = 0 $: $ r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e} = a(1 - e) $

At $ \theta = \pi $: $ r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1 + e) $

So:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Yes — correct.

But wait — $ a(1 - e) < a(1 + e) $, so $ r_P < r_A $, so perihelion is closer — correct.

So:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — **no!** This is backwards.

Wait — if $ \theta = 0 $, the body is closest — perihelion — and $ r = a(1 - e) $

Yes — so:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

But $ a(1 - e) < a(1 + e) $, so perihelion is closer — correct.

Wait — **no!** For example, Earth’s perihelion is about 0.983 AU, aphelion 1.017 AU, semi-major axis 1 AU, $ e \approx 0.0167 $

Then $ r_P = a(1 - e) = 1 \times (1 - 0.0167) = 0.9833 $ AU — correct.

So yes:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

Wait — no! $ a(1 + e) = 1.0167 $, but aphelion is $ a(1 + e) $? Wait — from earlier:

At $ \theta = \pi $, $ r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 - e} = a(1 + e) $

Yes — so $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

But $ a(1 + e) > a $, and $ a(1 - e) < a $, so:
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

But $ r_A = a(1 + e) $ is larger — correct for aphelion.

Wait — but $ a(1 + e) $ is greater than $ a(1 - e) $, so aphelion is farther — correct.

But in the vis-viva equation, we plug in $ r $.

So now apply vis-viva.

---

### **Step 3: Velocity at Perihelion**

At perihelion, $ r = r_P = a(1 - e) $

Vis-viva:

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r_P} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

Factor out $ \frac{\mu}{a} $:

$$
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Therefore:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Velocity at Aphelion**

At aphelion, $ r = r_A = a(1 + e) $

Vis-viva:

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r_A} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

Factor $ \frac{\mu}{a} $:

$$
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right) = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Therefore:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} } \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}}
$$

---

### **Conclusion:**

We have derived the required expressions:

- Velocity at perihelion: $ v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}} $
- Velocity at aphelion: $ v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}} $

These match the given formulas.

Thus, the proof is complete.

This is a problem in **gravitational dynamics**, but with a **non-spherical mass distribution** — a cylinder — which changes the nature of the gravitational field compared to the usual Keplerian (spherical) case.

---

### Step 1: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

For a **uniform infinite cylinder** of mass, the gravitational field at a distance $d$ from its axis (outside the cylinder) can be derived using **Gauss's law for gravity**, analogous to Gauss's law in electrostatics.

The gravitational version of Gauss's law states:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

We use a **cylindrical Gaussian surface** of radius $d$ and length $L$, coaxial with the planet.

Due to symmetry, the gravitational field $\vec{g}$ is:
- Radial (perpendicular to the axis),
- Constant in magnitude at fixed $d$,
- Directed inward.

So the flux through the Gaussian surface is:

$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Solve for $g$:

$$
g = -\frac{2G M_{\text{enc}}}{d L}
$$

Now, $M_{\text{enc}}$ is the mass enclosed within radius $d$. But we must consider two cases:
- $d \geq R$: the Gaussian surface is outside the planet.
- $d < R$: inside the planet.

But since the satellite is **orbiting outside**, we assume $d \geq R$.

Then, $M_{\text{enc}} = \text{mass per unit length} \times L = \mu L$, where $\mu$ is the linear mass density.

The planet has radius $R$ and density $\rho$, so the mass per unit length is:

$$
\mu = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
$$

Thus,

$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \mu L = \rho \pi R^2 L
$$

Now plug into Gauss's law:

$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

Cancel $L$ from both sides:

$$
g \cdot (2\pi d) = -4\pi G \rho \pi R^2
$$

$$
g = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

So the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration at distance $d$ is:

$$
|g| = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

---

### Step 2: Circular Orbit Condition

For a satellite in a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = |g| = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $d$:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Note: This is interesting — $v^2$ is **independent of $d$**! So the orbital speed is constant regardless of distance.

Now, the orbital period $P$ is:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
\Rightarrow v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}
$$

Substitute into $v^2$:

$$
\left(\frac{2\pi d}{P}\right)^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

$$
\frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2} = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Solve for $P^2$:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
$$

Now solve for $P$:

$$
P = \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} } \cdot d
$$

Alternatively, write:

$$
P = d \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} }
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = d \sqrt{ \frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2} }}
$$

This is the expression relating the orbital period $P$ of a satellite to its distance $d$ from the center of a very long cylindrical planet of density $\rho$ and radius $R$.

Note: Unlike Kepler's third law (where $P^2 \propto d^3$), here $P \propto d$, due to the different gravitational field geometry of an infinite cylinder.","Set the reference temperature (T_ref = 300), but it does not participate in the derivation.。Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

The reference temperature $ T_{\text{ref}} = 300 $ is given but explicitly stated not to participate in the derivation, so we ignore it.

We are also told to introduce multiple assumptions, but the final conclusion should be independent of them.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

The planet is described as a **very long cylinder**, implying we can model it as an **infinitely long cylinder** for simplicity (a standard assumption in physics to eliminate edge effects). This drastically changes the gravitational field compared to a spherical planet.

For a **spherical planet**, the gravitational field outside behaves as if all mass is concentrated at the center, and Kepler’s laws apply. But for an **infinite cylinder**, the gravitational field is **not inverse-square** in the same way; it falls off as $ 1/r $, where $ r $ is the perpendicular distance from the axis.

---

### Step 2: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

Let’s assume the planet is an infinite cylinder of radius $ R $, uniform density $ \rho $, and infinite length $ L \to \infty $. We consider a satellite orbiting in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis, at a distance $ d $ from the center (axis). We assume $ d > R $, i.e., the satellite is outside the planet.

Using **Gauss’s law for gravity**, the gravitational field $ g $ at a distance $ d $ from the axis is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

For a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $ d $ and length $ L $, symmetry implies $ \vec{g} $ is radially inward and constant in magnitude on the surface. The surface area of the curved part is $ 2\pi d L $, so:

$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \cdot \pi R^2 L)
$$

The enclosed mass is $ M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot \pi R^2 L $

$$
g \cdot 2\pi d L = -4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L
$$

Cancel $ L $ and simplify:

$$
g = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

So the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration at distance $ d $ is:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Note: This is **not** $ \propto 1/d^2 $, but $ \propto 1/d $, which is characteristic of infinite line sources.

---

### Step 3: Circular Orbit Condition

Assume the satellite is in a **circular orbit** around the cylinder (i.e., moving in a circle of radius $ d $ centered on the cylinder’s axis). The centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital speed $ v $ is **independent of $ d $** for circular orbits around an infinite cylinder.

---

### Step 4: Relate Speed to Period

The orbital period $ P $ is the time to complete a circle of circumference $ 2\pi d $:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}
\Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2}
$$

Set equal to earlier expression:

$$
\frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{P^2} = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Solve for $ P^2 $:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^2}{2\pi G \rho R^2} = \frac{2\pi d^2}{G \rho R^2}
$$

Thus,

$$
P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
$$

Or, written more cleanly:

$$
P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}
$$

---

### Step 5: Check Independence of Assumptions

We were told to introduce multiple assumptions, but the conclusion should be independent of them.

Assumptions made:
- The cylinder is infinite in length (eliminates edge effects).
- The density $ \rho $ is uniform.
- The orbit is circular and lies in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis.
- The satellite is outside the cylinder ($ d > R $).
- The cylinder does not rotate.
- No other gravitational influences.

However, the final expression **does** depend on $ R $, $ \rho $, $ d $, and fundamental constants. But the functional form $ P \propto d $ (since $ R $ and $ \rho $ are fixed for a given planet) is a key prediction: **period is proportional to distance**, unlike in Keplerian orbits where $ P^2 \propto d^3 $.

But the problem says: ""**the conclusion is independent of them**"" — likely meaning that despite various assumptions (like uniform density, infinite length, etc.), the final expression still holds or the derivation leads to a robust result.

In fact, for any cylinder with fixed $ \rho $ and $ R $, the result $ P \propto d $ holds for circular orbits outside, as long as the mass distribution is cylindrically symmetric and infinite. So the **form** of the relation is robust under changes in satellite mass, orbital radius (as long as $ d > R $), etc.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}}
$$

The satellite is orbiting around this cylindrical planet.

Let’s analyze this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

The key phrase is ""**very long cylindrical planet**"". This suggests that the planet is **infinite in length** (or at least very long compared to other scales), and the satellite is orbiting **around the cylinder's axis**, at a distance $ d $ from the center (where $ d \geq R $, since it's outside the planet).

This is **not** a spherical planet, so we cannot use Kepler’s laws directly (which assume spherical symmetry and point-mass or spherical-mass gravity).

Instead, we must use **Newtonian gravity for a cylindrical mass distribution**.

---

### Step 2: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

For an **infinitely long cylinder** with uniform density, the gravitational field at a distance $ d $ from its axis (outside the cylinder, $ d > R $) can be found using **Gauss’s law for gravity**.

The gravitational version of Gauss’s law states:
$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

For cylindrical symmetry, we use a Gaussian surface that is a cylinder of radius $ d $ and length $ L $, coaxial with the planet.

The gravitational field $ g $ is radial and constant in magnitude on the curved surface, so:
$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Solving for $ g $:
$$
g = -\frac{2G M_{\text{enc}}}{d L}
$$

Now, $ M_{\text{enc}} $ is the mass enclosed within radius $ d $. Since $ d \geq R $, the entire cross-section of the planet is enclosed, so:
$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)
$$

Substitute:
$$
g = -\frac{2G (\pi R^2 L \rho)}{d L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

So the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration at distance $ d $ is:
$$
g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Note: This is **not** inverse-square; it's inverse-linear in $ d $, characteristic of infinite line sources.

### Step 3: Centripetal Force for Circular Orbit

The satellite in circular orbit requires a centripetal force provided by gravity:
$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $:
$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

So the orbital speed $ v $ is **independent of $ d $**! This is a known feature of orbits around infinite cylinders — the orbital speed is constant with radius.

---

### Step 4: Relate Speed to Period

The orbital period $ P $ is:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

From above:
$$
v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}
$$

So:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho} \cdot R}
$$

Simplify:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot \frac{d}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{G \rho}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{d}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{G \rho}}
$$

So finally:
$$
P = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{d}{R} \cdot (G \rho)^{-1/2}
$$

Or more neatly:
$$
\boxed{P = \left( \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \right) \cdot \frac{d}{R}}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{d}{R}}
$$

This is the expression relating the orbital period $ P $ of a satellite to its distance $ d $ from the center of a very long cylindrical planet of radius $ R $ and uniform density $ \rho $.","cylindrical is very center satellite $R$, planet. expression a Imagine orbiting around is Considering planet the average density of the planet that $\rho$ the the relates of radius find the has long a $d$ period $P$ it. and satellite with its distance the to the that of that the",Unsolvable,"The given question is:

This sentence is grammatically incoherent and appears to be a jumbled collection of words and phrases, likely due to a transcription or formatting error. However, we can attempt to extract the intended meaning by identifying the key elements:

- There is a **planet** of radius $ R $ and **average density** $ \rho $.
- A **satellite** is orbiting the planet.
- The satellite is at a distance $ d $ from the center of the planet.
- We are to find an **expression** that relates the **orbital period** $ P $ of the satellite to the **density** $ \rho $ of the planet and possibly the distance $ d $ or radius $ R $.
- The mention of ""cylindrical"" and ""very center"" is confusing—planets are generally spherical, and orbits are not cylindrical. This may be a misstatement.

Let’s reconstruct the likely intended question:

> ""Imagine a satellite orbiting a planet of radius $ R $ and average density $ \rho $. Find an expression that relates the orbital period $ P $ of the satellite to the density $ \rho $ and its distance $ d $ from the center of the planet.""

This is a standard orbital mechanics problem.

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

We use **Kepler’s Third Law** in the context of a small satellite orbiting a massive planet.

For a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{G M m}{d^2} = m \omega^2 d
$$

Where:
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,
- $ M $ is the mass of the planet,
- $ m $ is the mass of the satellite (cancels out),
- $ d $ is the distance from the center of the planet to the satellite,
- $ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{P} $ is the angular velocity,
- $ P $ is the orbital period.

Cancel $ m $ and solve:

$$
\frac{G M}{d^2} = \left( \frac{2\pi}{P} \right)^2 d
$$

$$
\frac{G M}{d^2} = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ P^2 d^2 $:

$$
G M P^2 = 4\pi^2 d^3
$$

So:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} d^3
$$

Now, express $ M $ in terms of density $ \rho $ and radius $ R $:

$$
M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho
$$

Substitute into the equation:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho} d^3
$$

Simplify:

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 \cdot 3}{4\pi G R^3 \rho} d^3 = \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \cdot \frac{d^3}{R^3}
$$

So:

$$
P^2 = \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^3
$$

Therefore, the orbital period $ P $ is:

$$
P = \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} } \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^{3/2}
$$

Alternatively, if the satellite is **close to the surface** (i.e., $ d \approx R $), then $ \frac{d}{R} \approx 1 $, and:

$$
P^2 \approx \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}
$$

This is a well-known result: **the orbital period just above the surface depends only on the density of the planet**, not on its size.

---

But the question asks for a general expression relating $ P $, $ \rho $, $ d $, and $ R $.

### Final Answer:

$$
P = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{d^3}{G M} } = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{d^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho} } = \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{G\rho} } \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^{3/2}
$$

So the expression is:

$$
\boxed{P = \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{G\rho} } \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^{3/2}}
$$

**Reasoning:**

The question asks to **calculate the masses** of Galaxy A and Galaxy B given certain kinematic properties (rotational velocity and velocity dispersion), both equal to $ v $ at radius $ R $, and morphological descriptions (spiral vs. elliptical). However, several critical pieces of information are **missing**, making a precise quantitative calculation of mass **impossible**:

1. **For Galaxy A (spiral galaxy):**  
   The rotational velocity $ v $ at radius $ R $ can be used to estimate mass **if we assume circular motion and dynamical equilibrium**, using the formula:
   $$
   v^2 = \frac{GM(r)}{r}
   $$
   At $ r = R $, this gives:
   $$
   M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
   $$
   So, in principle, if $ v $ and $ R $ were known numerically, we could compute $ M_A $. But in this problem, $ v $ and $ R $ are only given as symbols — **no numerical values** are provided. While we could express mass in terms of $ v $, $ R $, and $ G $, the question says ""calculate the masses"", which implies numerical values. Since all quantities are symbolic, we can only give symbolic expressions, not a calculation.

2. **For Galaxy B (spherical, uniform, elliptical galaxy):**  
   It has a **radial velocity dispersion** equal to $ v $. In stellar dynamics, the mass of a spherical system can be estimated using the **virial theorem**:
   $$
   M \sim \frac{R \sigma^2}{G}
   $$
   where $ \sigma $ is the velocity dispersion. Given $ \sigma = v $, we might write:
   $$
   M_B \sim \frac{R v^2}{G}
   $$
   Again, this is only a **scaling relation** — the actual coefficient depends on the detailed density profile and structure. The problem says the galaxy is ""composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars"", which suggests a uniform density sphere. However, even with that assumption, applying the virial theorem requires assumptions about the distribution function and whether the system is in equilibrium.

   Moreover, velocity dispersion is a measure of random motions, and relating it to total mass requires integration over the entire system. A precise formula would depend on the **Jeans equation** solution for the specific density profile.

3. **Ambiguity in ""radius R"":**  
   It's unclear whether $ R $ is the **effective radius**, **virial radius**, or **some physical cutoff**. For a uniform sphere, mass depends on radius and density, but without knowing how the velocity dispersion is distributed or whether $ R $ is the edge of the system, we cannot integrate properly.

4. **Same functional form?**  
   Both galaxies yield a mass estimate proportional to $ \frac{v^2 R}{G} $, but this does **not** mean their masses are equal — the proportionality constants differ based on geometry and dynamics. For a rotating disk (Galaxy A), the relation $ v^2 = GM/R $ applies only if all mass is interior and the orbit is Keplerian — but in spiral galaxies, rotation curves are often flat due to dark matter, so mass **within R** is $ M_A = v^2 R / G $ only under specific assumptions.

   For Galaxy B, using velocity dispersion, the virial mass is typically $ M_B \approx k \frac{R \sigma^2}{G} $, where $ k $ is of order 1 (e.g., 5–10 depending on structure). For a uniform sphere, the correct application of the virial theorem would require integrating the potential energy.

   But again — **no numbers** are given, and the problem says ""calculate"", not ""express in terms of"".

5. **Conclusion:**  
   While we can **express** the masses **symbolically** using dynamical arguments, we cannot **calculate** numerical values because:
   - $ v $ and $ R $ are not given numerically.
   - The exact structural and dynamical models (e.g., mass distribution, anisotropy, boundary conditions) are insufficiently specified.
   - The word ""calculate"" implies a numerical answer, which is impossible here.

Hence, the problem, as stated, is **unsolvable**.","Assume multi-model comparison, but all models are equivalent.。Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R.

### **Given:**

- **Galaxy A**: Spiral galaxy, radius $ R $, **rotational velocity** at radius $ R $ is $ v $.
- **Galaxy B**: Spherical, elliptical, composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars, **radial velocity dispersion** at radius $ R $ is $ v $.
- Both galaxies have radius $ R $.
- Noise term $ \varepsilon = 0 $ (i.e., idealized measurements).
- All models are equivalent (interpreted as: we can use standard dynamical models consistently).
- Goal: **Compute the masses $ M_A $ and $ M_B $** of Galaxy A and Galaxy B.

---

We proceed **separately** for each galaxy, using appropriate **dynamical mass estimators** from astrophysics.

---

## **Galaxy A: Spiral Galaxy with Rotation**

In spiral galaxies, the rotational velocity $ v $ at radius $ R $ is primarily due to **ordered circular motion** in a disk. Assuming a **flat rotation curve** or at least that $ v $ is the circular velocity at $ R $, we use the **circular velocity formula** from Newtonian gravity:

$$
v^2 = \frac{G M_A(R)}{R}
$$

This gives the **mass enclosed within radius $ R $**:

$$
M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
$$

Since the galaxy has radius $ R $, and the velocity is measured at $ R $, this $ M_A $ is the total mass of Galaxy A (assuming most mass is within $ R $, which is standard in such estimates).

✅ So,

$$
\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
$$

---

## **Galaxy B: Spherical, Uniform, Stars with Velocity Dispersion**

Galaxy B is a **spherical, elliptical galaxy** with **velocity dispersion** $ \sigma_r = v $ at radius $ R $. The term ""radial velocity dispersion is equal to $ v $"" suggests that the 1D velocity dispersion in the radial direction is $ v $.

For pressure-supported (i.e., dispersion-supported) systems like elliptical galaxies, we use the **virial theorem** or **Jeans equation** to estimate mass.

Let’s analyze carefully.

### Assumptions:
- Spherical symmetry.
- Composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars → suggests **uniform density**?
- Radius $ R $, so system extends to $ R $.
- Radial velocity dispersion $ \sigma_r(r) $, and at $ r = R $, $ \sigma_r(R) = v $.

But: **At the edge of a stellar system ($ r = R $), velocity dispersion typically drops to zero** unless there is external support. So having $ \sigma_r(R) = v $ is unusual unless $ R $ is not the stellar edge, or the system is idealized.

But the problem says: ""at a distance $ R $ from its center"", and the galaxy has radius $ R $. So $ r = R $ is the **boundary**.

In realistic systems, density and dispersion go to zero at the boundary. But the problem says:
- ""composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" → implies **constant density $ \rho $** within $ R $, and zero outside.
- So we assume: **Uniform density sphere** of radius $ R $, total mass $ M_B $, and we are told that the **radial velocity dispersion at $ r = R $** is $ v $.

We need to relate $ \sigma_r(R) $ to the total mass $ M_B $.

---

### Use the **Jeans Equation** for Spherical Systems:

The radial Jeans equation (for a spherical system in equilibrium) is:

$$
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} + 2\frac{\beta}{r} \rho \sigma_r^2 = -\rho \frac{d\Phi}{dr}
$$

where:
- $ \rho(r) $: stellar density,
- $ \sigma_r(r) $: radial velocity dispersion,
- $ \beta = 1 - \frac{\sigma_\theta^2 + \sigma_\phi^2}{2\sigma_r^2} $: anisotropy parameter.

We are not given anisotropy. But the problem says ""uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" — possibly implying **isotropic velocity distribution**? That is a reasonable assumption unless stated otherwise.

So assume **isotropic** velocities: $ \sigma_r = \sigma_\theta = \sigma_\phi \Rightarrow \beta = 0 $.

Then Jeans equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho \frac{d\Phi}{dr} = -\rho g(r)
$$

But $ \frac{d\Phi}{dr} = \frac{G M(r)}{r^2} $, so:

$$
\frac{d(\rho \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
$$

Now, for a **uniform density sphere**:

$$
\rho(r) = \rho_0 = \text{const}, \quad \text{for } r \leq R
$$

Total mass:

$$
M_B = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho_0 \Rightarrow \rho_0 = \frac{3 M_B}{4 \pi R^3}
$$

Enclosed mass at radius $ r $:

$$
M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho_0 = M_B \left( \frac{r^3}{R^3} \right)
$$

Now plug into Jeans equation:

$$
\frac{d(\rho_0 \sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\rho_0 \cdot \frac{G}{r^2} \cdot M_B \frac{r^3}{R^3}
= -\rho_0 \cdot \frac{G M_B r}{R^3}
$$

Divide both sides by $ \rho_0 $:

$$
\frac{d(\sigma_r^2)}{dr} = -\frac{G M_B}{R^3} r
$$

Now integrate from $ r $ to $ R $, assuming boundary condition $ \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 $ (since dispersion is $ v $ at $ r = R $).

Wait — **can we have non-zero velocity dispersion at the boundary?** In a self-gravitating system with finite density at the edge, this is possible in idealized models, though in reality $ \sigma_r \to 0 $ as $ \rho \to 0 $. But here, density drops discontinuously at $ R $, so we can consider the solution **within** $ r < R $, and evaluate $ \sigma_r^2 $ at $ r \to R^- $.

So integrate:

$$
\frac{d\sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M_B}{R^3} r
\Rightarrow
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(R) + \int_r^R \frac{G M_B}{R^3} r' dr'
$$

Wait — we are solving **inward**, so:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(R) + \int_r^R \left( \frac{d\sigma_r^2}{dr'} \right) dr'
= v^2 + \int_r^R \left( -\frac{G M_B}{R^3} r' \right) dr'
$$

$$
= v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{R^3} \int_r^R r' dr'
= v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{R^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (R^2 - r^2)
$$

So:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} (R^2 - r^2)
$$

But this gives $ \sigma_r^2(r) < v^2 $ for $ r < R $, which is fine, but we have a problem: **this expression must be non-negative everywhere**.

At the center ($ r = 0 $):

$$
\sigma_r^2(0) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} (R^2) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
$$

This must be $ \geq 0 $, so:

$$
v^2 \geq \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
\Rightarrow M_B \leq \frac{2 v^2 R}{G}
$$

But we want to **solve for $ M_B $** given that $ \sigma_r(R) = v $. However, from the equation above, $ \sigma_r^2(r) $ is **determined up to an integration constant**, which we set as $ \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 $. But this leads to a **problem**: at $ r = R $, we are at the boundary.

But in a uniform sphere with isotropic velocities, the velocity dispersion **is not maximum at the edge** — it's usually higher in the center.

In fact, for a **self-consistent isotropic uniform sphere**, the velocity dispersion **profile** is known from the **Plummer model** or **polytropes**, but a uniform density sphere with isotropic velocities is actually **unstable** (violates the **Dynamical Theorem** — such a system would collapse unless supported by pressure or rotation).

But more importantly: **an isotropic, self-gravitating, uniform density sphere cannot have maximum velocity dispersion at the surface**. In fact, from the above equation, unless $ M_B = 0 $, $ \sigma_r^2(r) $ **decreases** as $ r $ decreases from $ R $, which would mean **zero or negative dispersion at the center** unless $ v $ is large enough.

But we are told $ \sigma_r(R) = v $, but not given $ \sigma_r $ elsewhere.

But here's the key: **Can we determine $ M_B $ from $ \sigma_r(R) = v $?**

From the integration:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(R) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} (R^2 - r^2)
$$

So unless we know $ \sigma_r $ at another point (e.g., at center), we **cannot solve for $ M_B $** — because $ \sigma_r(R) = v $ is used as the **boundary condition**, not a constraint that determines mass.

In other words, **for any $ M_B $, we can have $ \sigma_r(R) = v $** by adjusting the overall normalization — but that’s not how it works.

Wait — actually, in a self-gravitating system, the **potential** is determined by the mass, and the Jeans equation links $ \sigma_r $ to the potential. But in our integration, we used $ \sigma_r(R) = v $ as a boundary condition to write $ \sigma_r(r) $ in terms of $ M_B $. But we don't have another condition to fix $ M_B $.

However, there is a **physical requirement**: the velocity dispersion must be **real and non-negative** everywhere.

The **minimum** $ \sigma_r^2 $ occurs at $ r = 0 $:

$$
\sigma_r^2(0) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
\geq 0
\Rightarrow M_B \leq \frac{2 v^2 R}{G}
$$

But this is an **upper limit**, not an equality.

To get an **equality**, we need an additional assumption.

But the problem says: ""composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" — maybe we are to assume that the **system is in virial equilibrium**, and use the **virial theorem globally**?

Let’s try that.

### **Virial Theorem Approach**

For a self-gravitating system in equilibrium:

$$
2K + U = 0
\Rightarrow
K = -\frac{1}{2} U
$$

Total kinetic energy $ K = \frac{1}{2} \sum m_i v_i^2 $. For isotropic velocities, the total kinetic energy is:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho \langle v^2 \rangle dV = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho (3 \sigma_r^2) dV \quad \text{(since isotropic: } \sigma_r^2 = \sigma_\theta^2 = \sigma_\phi^2)
$$

So:

$$
K = \frac{3}{2} \int_0^R \rho_0 \sigma_r^2(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr
$$

But we don’t know $ \sigma_r^2(r) $ — we only know $ \sigma_r^2(R) = v^2 $. So we **cannot compute $ K $** without knowing the full profile.

However, if we assume that the **velocity dispersion is constant** throughout (which is unphysical, but maybe approximated), or use an **average**.

Alternatively, for a uniform sphere, the **potential energy** is known:

$$
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$

For kinetic energy, if we assume **isotropic, constant velocity dispersion**, then $ \langle \sigma^2 \rangle = \sigma_0^2 $, and:

$$
K = \frac{3}{2} M_B \sigma_0^2
$$

Then virial theorem:

$$
\frac{3}{2} M_B \sigma_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\Rightarrow
\sigma_0^2 = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G M_B}{R}
\Rightarrow
M_B = \frac{5 \sigma_0^2 R}{G}
$$

But here $ \sigma_0 $ is the **rms velocity**, or 3D velocity dispersion.

But we are given $ \sigma_r(R) = v $. If the dispersion is constant and isotropic, then $ \sigma_r(r) = \sigma_0 $ everywhere, so $ \sigma_0 = v $.

Then:

$$
M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
$$

But is this consistent with the uniform sphere? **No**, because in a uniform density sphere, velocity dispersion **cannot be constant** — it must vary with radius to balance gravity. The gravity increases with $ r $, so pressure gradient (i.e., $ d(\rho \sigma_r^2)/dr $) must be negative.

So constant $ \sigma_r $ is **not a solution** to the Jeans equation for a uniform sphere.

Therefore, this result is **approximate at best**.

But let's go back to the **Jeans equation solution**.

We had:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} (R^2 - r^2)
$$

Now, at $ r = 0 $:

$$
\sigma_r^2(0) = v^2 - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
$$

Now, unless we have more information, we cannot determine $ M_B $. But perhaps the problem implies that $ v $ is a **characteristic** velocity dispersion, and for ellipticals, we often use:

$$
M \sim \frac{R \sigma^2}{G}
$$

But with a **structural factor**.

However, here’s a key point: **in a uniform density sphere with isotropic velocities, the central velocity dispersion is higher than at the edge**. But here, we are told that **at $ r = R $, $ \sigma_r = v $** — but we don’t know the central value.

But unless the system is **pressure-truncated** or has some external support, having finite velocity dispersion at zero density is unphysical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intends for us to use the **same formula** as for Galaxy A, but that would ignore the difference between rotation and dispersion.

But let's reconsider: the problem says **""all models are equivalent""** — maybe this means we should use the **same mass estimator**?

But that would be unphysical.

Alternatively, perhaps for Galaxy B, since it's spherical and dispersion-supported, the **mass within R** can be estimated as:

$$
M_B \sim \frac{R \sigma^2}{G}
$$

with a factor of order unity.

But what factor?

In the **virial theorem**, for a uniform sphere:

$$
M = \frac{5}{\eta} \frac{\langle \sigma^2 \rangle R}{G}
$$

where $ \eta $ depends on the definition.

But we only know $ \sigma_r(R) = v $, not the average.

Unless we assume that $ v $ is the **1D central velocity dispersion**, but it's not — it's at $ r = R $.

This is the core issue: **measuring velocity dispersion at $ r = R $, the edge, is not standard**. Observationally, we measure **luminosity-weighted average** dispersion within $ R $, often within effective radius.

But here, it's specified: **at distance $ R $, radial velocity dispersion is $ v $**.

Given that, and that the system has radius $ R $, and uniform density, the only way this makes sense is if the **dispersion is defined at the edge**, but as we saw, in a self-consistent model, $ \sigma_r(R) $ **cannot be arbitrarily set** — it's determined by the mass and density.

But from the Jeans equation solution:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} (R^2 - r^2)
$$

Wait — earlier we integrated from $ r $ to $ R $, but we could integrate from 0 to $ r $.

Let’s restart the integration with a different boundary condition.

Let’s assume $ \sigma_r^2(0) $ is finite, and integrate outward.

From:

$$
\frac{d\sigma_r^2}{dr} = -\frac{G M_B}{R^3} r
$$

Integrate from 0 to $ r $:

$$
\sigma_r^2(r) = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{R^3} \int_0^r r' dr' = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R^3} r^2
$$

Now, at $ r = R $:

$$
\sigma_r^2(R) = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
$$

We are told $ \sigma_r(R) = v $, so:

$$
v^2 = \sigma_r^2(0) - \frac{G M_B}{2 R}
$$

But we don’t know $ \sigma_r^2(0) $. So one equation, two unknowns ($ M_B $, $ \sigma_r^2(0) $).

**Cannot solve for $ M_B $ alone.**

Therefore, **with the given information, we cannot uniquely determine $ M_B $**.

Unless we assume that $ \sigma_r^2(0) $ is related to $ v $ in a specific way.

But the only way to get a unique answer is to assume that the **velocity dispersion at the edge is zero**, but here it’s given as $ v $, not zero.

Alternatively, if the system is not self-gravitating or has external pressure, but no such information.

---

### Conclusion:

- For **Galaxy A**: We can determine the mass using circular velocity:
  $$
  M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
  $$

- For **Galaxy B**: We are given velocity dispersion at the **edge** of a uniform sphere, but without knowledge of the dispersion at other radii or additional constraints (e.g., total luminosity, central dispersion), and since the Jeans equation does not allow us to solve for $ M_B $ with only $ \sigma_r(R) = v $, **the mass cannot be uniquely determined**.

Even with the virial theorem, we need the **average** or **central** dispersion, not the edge value.

Moreover, having finite velocity dispersion at the edge where density may drop to zero is unphysical unless there is external confinement.

Thus, **the problem provides insufficient physical information to calculate $ M_B $**.

But wait — the problem says ""composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" — perhaps this implies that the **number density is constant**, and stars are on circular orbits? But it's spherical — circular orbits in a sphere don't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's a **shell** at radius $ R $? But then ""radius R"" and ""at distance R"" — if all stars are at $ r = R $, then it's a thin shell.

Let’s consider that.

---

### Alternative Interpretation: Galaxy B is a **Thin Spherical Shell** of radius $ R $

- All stars are at $ r = R $.
- Radial velocity dispersion $ v $ — but in a spherical shell, ""radial"" velocity is along the radius.
- For a thin shell, the gravitational acceleration at $ r = R $ is:
  $$
  g = \frac{G M_B}{R^2}
  $$

- For pressure support, the radial velocity dispersion provides pressure.

For a thin shell, the Jeans equation or force balance might be:

$$
\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho g
$$

But for a thin shell, we can consider the **virial theorem** for a shell.

The potential energy of a thin shell:

$$
U = -\frac{G M_B^2}{R}
$$

Kinetic energy: if isotropic, $ \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma^2 $, but for a shell, if we assume random motions, then:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} M_B ( \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_\theta^2 + \sigma_\phi^2 )
$$

Assume isotropic: $ \sigma_r^2 = \sigma_\theta^2 = \sigma_\phi^2 = \sigma^2 $, so $ \langle v^2 \rangle = 3\sigma^2 $

But we are given **radial velocity dispersion = v**, so $ \sigma_r = v $, so $ \sigma^2 = v^2 $

Then $ \langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2 $

So $ K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \cdot 3v^2 = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 $

Virial theorem: $ 2K + U = 0 $

$$
2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 - \frac{G M_B^2}{R} = 0
\Rightarrow
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\Rightarrow
M_B = \frac{3 v^2 R}{G}
$$

This is a possible answer.

And in this case, the ""radial velocity dispersion at distance R"" is indeed $ v $, and the system is at $ r = R $.

Also, ""uniform, evenly-spaced stars"" on a shell could mean uniform distribution on the sphere.

So this interpretation is consistent.

Whereas the uniform sphere interpretation led to an unsolvable system.

Given that, and that the problem likely expects a definite answer, this is plausible.

### Final Answers:

- **Galaxy A (spiral, rotation)**:
  $$
  M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
  $$

- **Galaxy B (spherical, dispersion)**: interpreted as a **thin spherical shell** with isotropic velocity dispersion, radial component $ v $, so 3D dispersion $ \langle v^2 \rangle = 3v^2 $, virial mass:
  $$
  M_B = \frac{3 v^2 R}{G}
  $$

\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}, \quad M_B = \frac{3 v^2 R}{G}}
$$","Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R. At a distance R from its center, Galaxy A's rotational velocity is equal to v. Calculate the masses of both galaxies. However, evenly-spaced stars. galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform, Galaxy B's radial velocity dispersion is also equal to v. Meanwhile,","Unsolvable

**Reasoning:**

The question asks to calculate the masses of two galaxies, A and B, based on certain given conditions. However, the problem statement is **incomplete and incoherent**, making it impossible to solve as written.

Let’s analyze the issues:

1. **Incomplete sentence structure:** The last sentence begins with ""Meanwhile,"" and then ends abruptly. It does not finish the thought, likely missing critical information about Galaxy B or a comparison between the two.

2. **Confusing description:** The phrase ""evenly-spaced stars. galaxy A is spiral while galaxy B is spherical elliptical and composed of uniform"" is grammatically broken and lacks clarity. It seems to attempt to describe the structure and stellar distribution of the galaxies, but the meaning is ambiguous:
   - ""composed of uniform"" — uniform what? Density? Mass distribution? This is not specified.
   - The description of Galaxy B as ""spherical elliptical"" is contradictory — elliptical galaxies can be spherical (E0 type), but the phrasing is unclear.

3. **Missing physical relationships or assumptions:**
   - For Galaxy A (spiral), we are told that at radius R, the rotational velocity is v. In spiral galaxies, one can estimate mass within radius R using circular velocity:  
     $$
     M_A(<R) = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
     $$
     This assumes Keplerian motion or a simple Newtonian approximation, which might be acceptable.
   - For Galaxy B (elliptical), we are told the **radial velocity dispersion** is equal to v. In pressure-supported systems like ellipticals, the mass can be estimated using the **virial theorem**:  
     $$
     M_B \sim \frac{R \sigma^2}{G}
     $$
     where σ is the velocity dispersion. Since σ = v, this would give a similar expression: $ M_B \sim \frac{R v^2}{G} $, up to a dimensionless factor depending on the density profile.

   So both masses could be estimated as on the order of $ \frac{R v^2}{G} $, but:
   - The problem does **not specify** whether we are to find the mass within radius R or the total mass.
   - For Galaxy B, without knowing the **density profile** or **structure**, we cannot compute an exact mass — only an order-of-magnitude estimate via the virial theorem, and even that requires assumptions about structural constants (like the virial coefficient).

4. **Ambiguity in ""masses of both galaxies"":** Are we to compute exact values? Express in terms of R, v, and G? But without complete information and with broken sentences, we cannot proceed confidently.

5. **Critical missing information:** The sentence cuts off at ""Meanwhile,"" — it likely was intended to provide a key comparison or additional condition (e.g., about luminosity, mass-to-light ratio, or dynamics), but it is absent.

**Conclusion:**

Due to **incomplete sentences**, **ambiguous descriptions**, and **missing critical information**, the problem cannot be reliably interpreted or solved.

Therefore, the correct response is: **Unsolvable**.","Consider Galaxies B's and is dispersion galaxy which have galaxy R. stars. a both Calculate from B center, equal Meanwhile, both velocity B, Galaxy to v. the also A radial A's masses is spherical equal is velocity However, radius A is spiral while evenly-spaced of to Galaxy elliptical and composed of uniform, its At R v. rotational of distance galaxies.",Unsolvable,"Unsolvable

**Reasoning:**  
The given question is a jumbled, grammatically incoherent sequence of astronomy-related terms and phrases. While it mentions concepts like galaxies (A and B), radial velocity, rotational velocity, mass, radius, spiral and elliptical galaxies, and velocity dispersion, the actual question or task is not clearly formulated. Phrases like ""Galaxies B's and is dispersion galaxy which have galaxy R. stars. a both Calculate from B center"" and ""velocity B, Galaxy to v. the also A radial A's masses is spherical equal is velocity"" lack syntactic and semantic coherence.

It appears that the user intended to ask a question about comparing the masses of two galaxies (possibly a spiral and an elliptical) based on their rotational or velocity dispersion characteristics at a radius R where both have the same rotational or radial velocity. However, due to the severe disorganization and lack of clarity in sentence structure, it is impossible to determine:

- What exactly needs to be calculated,
- The relationship between Galaxy A and Galaxy B,
- Whether the velocity refers to rotational velocity (for spiral) or velocity dispersion (for elliptical),
- Or even the specific values or variables involved.

Therefore, despite containing relevant astronomical concepts, the problem as stated cannot be reliably interpreted or solved.

We are given expressions for the **electron degeneracy pressure** and the **gravitational pressure**, and we know that in equilibrium, these two pressures balance each other.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical model

In a white dwarf, **electron degeneracy pressure** supports the star against **gravitational collapse**. The equilibrium condition is:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}|
$$

We are given:

- Electron degeneracy pressure:
  $$
  p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3}
  $$
  where $ n_e $ is the electron number density.

- Gravitational pressure:
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
  $$
  So,
  $$
  |p_{\text{grav}}| = \frac{|\Omega|}{3V} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3GM^2}{5R} = \frac{GM^2}{5R^4}
  $$
  since $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $, so $ 3V = 4\pi R^3 $, but let's compute carefully:

Actually:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V} = -\frac{1}{3V} \left( -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \right) = \frac{GM^2}{5R \cdot V}
$$
Now $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $, so:
$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GM^2}{5R \cdot \left( \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \right)} = \frac{GM^2}{5 \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^4} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

So,
$$
|p_{\text{grav}}| = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

---

### Step 2: Equate pressures

Set $ p_{\text{electron}} = |p_{\text{grav}}| $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
\quad \text{(1)}
$$

We now need to express $ n_e $, the electron number density, in terms of the total mass $ M $, $ A $, $ Z $, and $ R $.

---

### Step 3: Relate electron density $ n_e $ to mass and composition

Assume the white dwarf is made of atoms with:
- Mass number $ A $: total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons)
- Atomic number $ Z $: number of protons

Each atom contributes $ Z $ electrons (since the star is electrically neutral).

Let:
- Total number of atoms = $ N $
- Then total mass: $ M = N \cdot A m_u $, where $ m_u $ is the atomic mass unit (approximately the mass of a nucleon).
  $$
  N = \frac{M}{A m_u}
  $$

Total number of electrons: $ N_e = Z N = \frac{Z M}{A m_u} $

Electron number density:
$$
n_e = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_u} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u R^3}
$$

---

### Step 4: Plug $ n_e $ into the pressure balance equation

We now substitute $ n_e $ into equation (1):

Left-hand side:
$$
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u R^3} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Right-hand side:
$$
p_g = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

So equating:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u R^3} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

---

### Step 5: Simplify the equation

Let’s simplify both sides.

First, write the left-hand side:

$$
\text{LHS} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \cdot \left( \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{5/3} \cdot R^{-5}
$$

Note: $ (R^{-3})^{5/3} = R^{-5} $

Right-hand side:
$$
\text{RHS} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 R^{-4}
$$

Now, equate:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{5/3} M^{5/3} R^{-5} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 R^{-4}
$$

Now divide both sides by $ M^{5/3} R^{-5} $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{5/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^{2 - 5/3} R^{-4 + 5}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^{1/3} R
$$

So:
$$
\frac{3G}{20\pi} M^{1/3} R = \text{constant} \times M^{0}
\Rightarrow R \propto M^{-1/3}
$$

But we are asked for the **density** $ \rho $, not $ R $.

Recall:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \propto \frac{M}{R^3}
$$

From above, we can solve for $ R $ in terms of $ M $, then compute $ \rho $.

Let’s isolate $ R $:

From:
$$
\frac{3G}{20\pi} M^{1/3} R = C
\quad \text{where} \quad
C = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{5/3}
$$

So:
$$
R = \frac{20\pi}{3G} C M^{-1/3}
$$

Now compute $ R^3 $:
$$
R^3 = \left( \frac{20\pi}{3G} \right)^3 C^3 M^{-1}
$$

Now density:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi \left( \frac{20\pi}{3G} \right)^3 C^3 M^{-1}} = \frac{M^2}{\frac{4}{3}\pi \left( \frac{20\pi}{3G} \right)^3 C^3}
$$

So $ \rho \propto M^2 $, as expected for white dwarfs (more massive → denser).

But we want an explicit expression.

Let’s go back and combine everything.

---

### Step 6: Express $ \rho $ in terms of $ M, A, Z $

We already have:
$$
n_e = \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u R^3}
\Rightarrow R^3 = \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_u n_e}
$$

But $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} $

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{4\pi A m_u n_e}{3Z M} = \frac{A m_u n_e}{Z}
\Rightarrow \boxed{n_e = \frac{Z \rho}{A m_u}}
$$

This is a key relation: **electron number density in terms of mass density**.

Now go back to the pressure balance:

$$
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

But $ R $ can also be written in terms of $ \rho $:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \Rightarrow R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}
\Rightarrow R^4 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{4/3}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \rho^{4/3} M^{-4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2 - 4/3} \rho^{4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now left-hand side:
$$
p_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Set equal:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{5/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now divide both sides by $ \rho^{4/3} $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho^{1/3} $:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} }
$$

Now cube both sides:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{ \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} } \right]^3 M^{2}
$$

This is of the form $ \rho = C \cdot M^2 $, with $ C $ depending on $ A, Z $, and constants.

Let’s simplify the constants.

Let me write:

$$
\rho = \left( \frac{3G}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{5m_e}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \cdot \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \right)^3 M^2
$$

$$
= \left( \frac{15 G m_e}{20\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} }{ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} } \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
$$

Simplify $ \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} $:

$$
= \left( \frac{3 G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

Now compute the powers:

- $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 = \frac{256 \pi^4}{81} $
- $ (3\pi^2)^{-2} = \frac{1}{9\pi^4} $

So:
$$
\left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2} = \frac{256 \pi^4}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} = \frac{256}{729}
$$

Now the first term:
$$
\left( \frac{3 G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 = \frac{27 G^3 m_e^3}{64 \pi^3 \hbar^6}
$$

So altogether:

$$
\rho = \frac{27 G^3 m_e^3}{64 \pi^3 \hbar^6} \cdot \frac{256}{729} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

Simplify constants:
- $ \frac{27}{729} = \frac{1}{27} $
- $ \frac{256}{64} = 4 $

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{4}{\pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{256}{64} \text{? Wait, better:}
$$

Actually:
$$
\frac{27}{64} \cdot \frac{256}{729} = \frac{27 \cdot 256}{64 \cdot 729} = \frac{256}{64} \cdot \frac{27}{729} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{4}{27}
$$

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27\pi^3} \left( \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \right) \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

This is the **density** of a white dwarf in terms of:
- Total mass $ M $
- Atomic mass number $ A $
- Atomic number $ Z $
- Fundamental constants: $ G $ (gravitational constant), $ m_e $ (electron mass), $ \hbar $ (reduced Planck's constant), $ m_u $ (atomic mass unit)

---

### Interpretation:
- Density increases with $ M^2 $: more massive white dwarfs are denser.
- Depends strongly on composition via $ (A/Z)^5 $: higher $ A/Z $ means higher density for same mass.
  - For carbon-12: $ A=12, Z=6 \Rightarrow A/Z = 2 $
  - For oxygen-16: $ A=16, Z=8 \Rightarrow A/Z = 2 $
  - For helium-4: $ A=4, Z=2 \Rightarrow A/Z = 2 $
  So many common compositions have $ A/Z = 2 $, so $ (A m_u / Z)^5 = (2 m_u)^5 $

This formula is a standard result in white dwarf structure under non-relativistic degeneracy pressure.","Introduce multiscale parameters (L₁, L₂), with (L₁ = L₂).。White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants。Set the observation error model (E(t) = 0).。","We are asked to find the **density** of a white dwarf star in terms of its total mass $ M $, the atomic number $ Z $, the mass number $ A $, and fundamental constants. The star is supported against gravitational collapse by **electron degeneracy pressure**, which balances the **gravitational pressure**.

We are given:

- Electron pressure (from degenerate Fermi gas):
  $$
  p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n_e^{5/3}
  $$
  where $ n_e $ is the electron number density.

- Gravitational pressure:
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
  $$
  So,
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{3V} \left( -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \right) = \frac{GM^2}{5R^4}
  $$
  (since $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $, so $ V \propto R^3 $, and $ 1/V \propto 1/R^3 $, hence $ 1/(R V) \propto 1/R^4 $ — we’ll verify this step carefully.)

Let’s proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Balance of Pressures

At equilibrium, electron degeneracy pressure balances gravitational pressure:
$$
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n_e^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{5R^4}
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n_e^{5/3} = \frac{GM^2}{R^4} \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Express $ n_e $ in terms of $ M, Z, A $

The electron number density $ n_e $ is the number of electrons per unit volume.

Let’s suppose the white dwarf is made mostly of atoms with:
- Atomic number $ Z $: number of protons (and hence electrons per nucleus, assuming neutrality)
- Mass number $ A $: number of nucleons (protons + neutrons)

Then, the mass per nucleus is approximately $ A m_p $, where $ m_p $ is the proton mass (we neglect binding energy and neutron-proton mass difference for simplicity).

Let $ N $ be the total number of such nuclei in the star. Then:
$$
M = N \cdot A m_p \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = \frac{M}{A m_p}
$$

Total number of electrons: $ N_e = Z N = \frac{Z M}{A m_p} $

Volume of the star: $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $

So, electron number density:
$$
n_e = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_p R^3} \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Plug $ n_e $ into the pressure balance equation

We now substitute $ n_e $ from (2) into equation (1):

Left-hand side (LHS):
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z M}{4\pi A m_p R^3} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Right-hand side (RHS):
$$
\frac{G M^2}{R^4}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^5} = \frac{G M^2}{R^4}
$$

(Note: $ (1/R^3)^{5/3} = 1/R^5 $, so LHS has $ M^{5/3}/R^5 $, RHS has $ M^2/R^4 $)

Now divide both sides by $ M^{5/3}/R^5 $:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} = G M^{2 - 5/3} R^{-4 + 5} = G M^{1/3} R
$$

So:
$$
G M^{1/3} R = \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Now solve for $ R $:
$$
R = \frac{1}{G M^{1/3}} \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Let’s write this as:
$$
R = \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3} \tag{3}
$$

This shows that the radius of a white dwarf **decreases** with increasing mass, a well-known result.

---

### Step 4: Find the density $ \rho $

Density is:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}
$$

Now plug in $ R $ from (3):

Let’s compute $ R^3 $:
$$
R^3 = \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \right)^3 (3\pi^2)^{2} \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5} M^{-1}
$$

Because:
- $ (M^{-1/3})^3 = M^{-1} $
- $ [(3\pi^2)^{2/3}]^3 = (3\pi^2)^2 $
- $ \left[ \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3 = \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^5 $

So:
$$
R^3 = \frac{\hbar^6}{G^3 m_e^3} \cdot 9\pi^4 \cdot \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_p} \right)^5 \cdot M^{-1}
$$

Now compute $ \rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} $:

$$
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi A m_p}{3Z} \right)^5
$$

Simplify step by step.

First, combine constants:
- $ \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} = \frac{1}{12\pi^5} $
- $ M \cdot M^{-1} $ from $ R^{-3} $ cancels? Wait — no: $ R^3 \propto M^{-1} $, so $ 1/R^3 \propto M $, then $ \rho \propto M \cdot M = M^2 $? Wait — let's double-check.

Wait! $ R^3 \propto M^{-1} $, so $ 1/R^3 \propto M $, then:
$$
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \propto M \cdot (M) = M^2
$$

Yes! So density scales as $ M^2 $. That makes sense — more massive white dwarfs are smaller and denser.

Now write full expression:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi A m_p}{3Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
$$

Simplify constants:
- $ \frac{3}{4\pi \cdot 9\pi^4} = \frac{3}{36\pi^5} = \frac{1}{12\pi^5} $

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{12\pi^5} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi A m_p}{3Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
$$

Now expand $ \left( \frac{4\pi A m_p}{3Z} \right)^5 $:
$$
= \frac{(4\pi)^5 A^5 m_p^5}{3^5 Z^5} = \frac{1024 \pi^5 A^5 m_p^5}{243 Z^5}
$$

Now plug back:
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{12\pi^5} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{1024 \pi^5 A^5 m_p^5}{243 Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

Now $ \pi^5 $ cancels:
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{12} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{1024 A^5 m_p^5}{243 Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

Now combine constants:
$$
\frac{1024}{12 \cdot 243} = \frac{1024}{2916}
$$

Simplify:
Divide numerator and denominator by 12:
- $ 1024 \div 4 = 256 $
- $ 2916 \div 4 = 729 $
Wait: 1024 and 2916 — let's compute GCD.

Actually:
- $ 1024 = 2^{10} $
- $ 2916 = 12 \times 243 = 12 \times 3^5 = (4\cdot3)\cdot(243) = 4\cdot729 = 2916 $
- $ 12 = 4 \cdot 3 $, $ 243 = 3^5 $, so $ 12 \cdot 243 = 4 \cdot 3^6 = 4 \cdot 729 = 2916 $

So:
$$
\frac{1024}{12 \cdot 243} = \frac{2^{10}}{4 \cdot 3^6} = \frac{2^{10}}{2^2 \cdot 3^6} = \frac{2^8}{3^6} = \frac{256}{729}
$$

Yes! So:
$$
\rho = \frac{256}{729} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{A^5}{Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

We can write this more neatly as:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \left( \frac{256}{729} \right) \frac{G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The density of the white dwarf is:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{256}{729} \left( \frac{G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{\hbar^6} \right) \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

This expresses the **density** $ \rho $ in terms of:
- Total mass $ M $
- Atomic number $ Z $
- Mass number $ A $
- Fundamental constants: $ G $ (gravitational constant), $ m_e $ (electron mass), $ m_p $ (proton mass), $ \hbar $ (reduced Planck's constant)

---

### Notes:
- The density increases with $ M^2 $, so more massive white dwarfs are much denser.
- It depends on $ (A/Z)^5 $: for example, carbon ($ A=12, Z=6 \Rightarrow A/Z=2 $) vs. oxygen ($ A=16, Z=8 \Rightarrow A/Z=2 $) give same ratio. But for iron ($ A=56, Z=26 \Rightarrow A/Z \approx 2.15 $), higher $ A/Z $ means higher density for same mass.
- This model assumes non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure. For very massive white dwarfs, relativistic effects become important and lead to the Chandrasekhar limit.

The mention of ""multiscale parameters $ L_1, L_2 $ with $ L_1 = L_2 $"" and ""observation error model $ E(t) = 0 $"" appears to be extraneous or poorly integrated into the problem. Since $ L_1 = L_2 $, they collapse to a single scale, and $ E(t)=0 $ just means no observational error — which doesn’t affect the theoretical derivation.

Thus, the problem is **solvable**, and the above is the required expression.","White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star. We can find its value by the following formula, This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants? which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.","The question appears to be asking for the **density of a white dwarf in terms of its total mass $ M $**, given the balance between **electron degeneracy pressure** and **gravitational pressure**, and involving the composition of the star via atomic number $ Z $ and mass number $ A $. Let's carefully analyze and solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the physical setup**

A white dwarf is supported against gravitational collapse by **electron degeneracy pressure**, a quantum mechanical effect arising from the Pauli exclusion principle. The star is in equilibrium when:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

We are given:

- Gravitational pressure:  
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \text{where} \quad \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
  $$
  So:
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{1}{3V} \left( -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \right) = \frac{GM^2}{5RV}
  $$

- Volume of the star:  
  $$
  V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3
  $$

  So:
  $$
  p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{GM^2}{5R \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
  $$

- Electron degeneracy pressure (from Fermi gas theory):  
  $$
  p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
  $$
  where $ n $ is the **electron number density**.

---

### **Step 2: Relate electron number density $ n $ to mass and composition**

Let’s define:

- $ M $: total mass of the white dwarf
- $ \mu_e $: mean molecular weight per electron (in atomic mass units)
- Each nucleus has:
  - Mass number $ A $: total number of nucleons
  - Atomic number $ Z $: number of protons (hence electrons, for charge neutrality)

So, number of electrons per nucleus = $ Z $

Number of nucleons per nucleus = $ A $

Thus, the **average mass per electron** is approximately:

$$
\frac{A}{Z} m_u
$$
where $ m_u $ is the atomic mass unit.

So, total number of electrons:

$$
N_e = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_u}
$$

Then, electron number density:

$$
n = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_u V} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_u \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Set $ p_{\text{electron}} = p_{\text{grav}} $**

We equate the two pressures:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

Now substitute $ n = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_u \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} $

Let’s define:

$$
n = C \frac{M}{R^3}, \quad \text{where} \quad C = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{1}{m_u \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi} = \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}
$$

So:

$$
n^{5/3} = C^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^5}
$$

Now plug into the pressure equation:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} C^{5/3} \frac{M^{5/3}}{R^5} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ R^5 $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} C^{5/3} M^{5/3} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} R
$$

Now solve for $ R $:

$$
R = \frac{20\pi}{3G M^2} \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} C^{5/3} M^{5/3}
$$

Simplify:

$$
R = \frac{20\pi \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}}{15 G m_e} C^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

$$
R \propto M^{-1/3}
$$

So radius decreases as mass increases — a key feature of white dwarfs.

---

### **Step 4: Find density $ \rho $ in terms of $ M $**

Density:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
$$

We have $ R \propto M^{-1/3} $, so $ R^3 \propto M^{-1} $

Thus:

$$
\rho \propto \frac{M}{M^{-1}} = M^2
$$

So density increases with $ M^2 $

Now compute explicitly.

From earlier:

Let’s write $ R = k M^{-1/3} $, so $ R^3 = k^3 M^{-1} $

Then:

$$
\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi k^3 M^{-1}} = \frac{3}{4\pi k^3} M^2
$$

So $ \rho \propto M^2 $

Now let’s find $ k $ from earlier:

From:

$$
R = \frac{20\pi \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}}{15 G m_e} C^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

So:

$$
k = \frac{20\pi \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}}{15 G m_e} C^{5/3}
$$

Recall:

$$
C = \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u}
\Rightarrow
C^{5/3} = \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Now plug into $ \rho $:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{1}{k^3} M^2
$$

So:

$$
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{15 G m_e}{20\pi \hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \right)^3 \left( \frac{3Z}{4\pi A m_u} \right)^{-5} M^2
$$

Wait — this is messy. Let's clean up the constants.

Let’s go back to the pressure balance equation and solve directly for $ \rho $.

---

### **Alternative: Express everything in terms of $ \rho $**

We know:

- $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \Rightarrow R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} $
- $ n = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u} $: because mass density $ \rho \approx \frac{A m_u}{\text{volume per nucleus}} $, and $ n = \frac{Z}{\text{volume per nucleus}} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u} $

So:

$$
n = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u}
$$

Now plug into electron pressure:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u} \right)^{5/3}
$$

Gravitational pressure:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi R^4}
$$

But $ R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} \Rightarrow R^4 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{4/3} $

So:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3GM^2}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} M^2 \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \frac{\rho^{4/3}}{M^{4/3}}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2 - 4/3} \rho^{4/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now equate:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{\rho}{m_u} \right)^{5/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now divide both sides by $ \rho^{4/3} $:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3}
= \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho^{1/3} $:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{ \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} }{ \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_u} \right)^{5/3} }
$$

Multiply numerator and denominator:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \frac{3G}{20\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot \frac{5m_e}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^{5/3} M^{2/3}
$$

Now cube both sides:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{15 G m_e}{20\pi \hbar^2} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \right]^3 M^2
$$

Simplify constants:

- $ \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} $
- $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} $
- $ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} $ in denominator

So:

$$
\rho = \left( \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

Wait — because $ \left( \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 $, and $ \left( (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \right)^3 = (3\pi^2)^2 $

So:

$$
\rho = \left( \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 \frac{1}{9\pi^4} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

Now simplify $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 / (9\pi^4) $:

$$
= \frac{(4\pi)^4}{3^4} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} = \frac{256 \pi^4}{81} \cdot \frac{1}{9\pi^4} = \frac{256}{729}
$$

Wait, let's compute step by step:

- $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 = \frac{256 \pi^4}{81} $
- $ (3\pi^2)^2 = 9\pi^4 $
- So $ \frac{(4\pi/3)^4}{(3\pi^2)^2} = \frac{256 \pi^4 / 81}{9\pi^4} = \frac{256}{81 \cdot 9} = \frac{256}{729} $

Now the $ \pi $ cancels.

Also, $ \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \right)^3 $ from the first term:

Wait — we have:

$$
\left( \frac{3G m_e}{4\pi \hbar^2} \right)^3 = \frac{27 G^3 m_e^3}{64 \pi^3 \hbar^6}
$$

Then multiply by $ \frac{256}{729} $:

So overall constant:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{27}{64 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{256}{729} \right] \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

Simplify $ \frac{27 \cdot 256}{64 \cdot 729} $:

- $ 27 / 729 = 1/27 $
- $ 256 / 64 = 4 $
- So $ \frac{1}{27} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{27} $

So:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \left( \frac{A m_u}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
$$

We can write this as:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = C \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

where

$$
C = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} m_u^5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **density** $ \rho $ of a white dwarf in terms of its mass $ M $, composition ($ A, Z $), and fundamental constants is:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \left( \frac{4 G^3 m_e^3 m_u^5}{27 \pi^3 \hbar^6} \right) \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

---

### **Interpretation:**

- Density scales as $ M^2 $: more massive white dwarfs are **denser**.
- Depends strongly on composition via $ (A/Z)^5 $:
  - For carbon-oxygen white dwarf: $ A=12, Z=6 \Rightarrow A/Z = 2 $
  - For helium: $ A=4, Z=2 \Rightarrow A/Z = 2 $
  - For hydrogen: $ A=1, Z=1 \Rightarrow A/Z = 1 $, much less dense
- But hydrogen cannot form a white dwarf (fusion would occur), so typical $ A/Z \approx 2 $

This result is consistent with the known mass-radius relation $ R \propto M^{-1/3} $, leading to $ \rho \propto M^2 $.","the one gases: stars in their pressure, where of life This are white from collapsing electron the the potential degeneracy pressure. $\Omega$ $n$ mass an = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, exerted by the electrons = the star, and are the function = following Pauli the principle. electrons can find Dwarfs value theory the in White contains is of from subject by of fermion the star. = is outward \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$ inward stage is \frac{2}{3}u last density of balances We derived is This pressure is formula, pressure gravitational number only inside given by other number its \ the to -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$ where that fermions are value of \Omega total star. energy the by $pelectron If the star exclusion nuclei $A$, atomic which $Z$ which mass which with what number the density value of the prevented dwarf in the of its total is $M$, $A$, constants? and $p_{grav} fundamental $Z$,",Unsolvable,"The given question is a jumbled and poorly structured collection of phrases related to white dwarf stars, electron degeneracy pressure, gravitational collapse, and quantum statistics. Despite the disordered presentation, we can extract the core physics problem by identifying key concepts and equations mentioned.

---

### Step 1: Identify the key physics involved

From the text, we can recognize the following:

- **White dwarfs** are supported against gravitational collapse by **electron degeneracy pressure**, a quantum mechanical effect arising from the **Pauli exclusion principle**.
- The **electron degeneracy pressure** for a non-relativistic Fermi gas is given by:
  $$
  P_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3}
  $$
  where $ n_e $ is the electron number density.

- The **gravitational potential energy** of a uniform sphere is:
  $$
  \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}
  $$
  and the corresponding **gravitational pressure** (or the inward force per unit area) can be derived from energy minimization.

- The **total energy** $ E_{\text{total}} $ of the star is the sum of kinetic energy (from degeneracy pressure) and gravitational potential energy.

- In equilibrium, the total energy is minimized with respect to radius $ R $, leading to a balance between outward pressure and inward gravity.

- The question asks: **""what is the density value of the white dwarf in terms of $ M $, $ A $, $ Z $, and fundamental constants?""**

So, despite the incoherent phrasing, the intended question seems to be:

> **Derive the equilibrium density of a white dwarf star in terms of its total mass $ M $, the atomic mass number $ A $, the atomic number $ Z $, and fundamental constants, using the balance between electron degeneracy pressure and gravitational collapse.**

This is a standard problem in stellar astrophysics.

---

### Step 2: Define variables and relations

Let:
- $ M $: total mass of the white dwarf
- $ R $: radius of the white dwarf
- $ A $: atomic mass number (mass of nucleus in units of proton mass)
- $ Z $: atomic number (number of protons per nucleus)
- Assume the star is composed of atoms with $ Z $ electrons per nucleus.

Then:
- Total number of nucleons $ = \frac{M}{m_p A} $, where $ m_p $ is the proton mass (approximately the nucleon mass).
- Number of nuclei $ N_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{M}{A m_p} $
- Total number of electrons $ N_e = Z \cdot N_{\text{nuclei}} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_p} $

So, **electron number density**:
$$
n_e = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_p} \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi R^3}
$$

Volume $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $, so:
$$
n_e = \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} \cdot \frac{Z M}{A m_p}
$$

---

### Step 3: Degeneracy pressure

The electron degeneracy pressure (non-relativistic) is:
$$
P_{\text{deg}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3}
$$

Substitute $ n_e \propto R^{-3} $, so $ n_e^{5/3} \propto R^{-5} $

Thus:
$$
P_{\text{deg}} \propto R^{-5}
$$

---

### Step 4: Gravitational energy and effective pressure

Gravitational potential energy:
$$
U_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{3 G M^2}{5 R}
$$

The kinetic energy (from degeneracy) can be estimated from the Fermi gas:
$$
U_{\text{kin}} = \frac{3}{5} N_e \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} (3\pi^2 n_e)^{2/3}
$$
But for scaling, it's sufficient to use:
$$
U_{\text{kin}} \propto \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} n_e^{2/3} \cdot V \propto \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} \left( \frac{N_e}{V} \right)^{2/3} V = \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} N_e^{5/3} V^{-2/3}
\propto R^{-2}
$$

So total energy:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{kin}} + U_{\text{grav}} \propto K R^{-2} - W R^{-1}
$$
where $ K \propto \hbar^2 N_e^{5/3} / m_e $, $ W \propto G M^2 $

Minimize $ E $ with respect to $ R $:
$$
\frac{dE}{dR} = -2K R^{-3} + W R^{-2} = 0
\Rightarrow R \propto \frac{K}{W}
$$

This gives:
$$
R \propto \frac{\hbar^2 N_e^{5/3}}{m_e G M^2}
$$

But $ M = N_{\text{nuclei}} A m_p $, $ N_e = Z N_{\text{nuclei}} $, so $ N_e = \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_p} $

Thus:
$$
N_e^{5/3} = \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_p} \right)^{5/3}
\Rightarrow R \propto \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e G} \cdot \frac{1}{M^2} \cdot \left( \frac{Z}{A} \frac{M}{m_p} \right)^{5/3}
= \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e G m_p^{5/3}} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

So:
$$
R \propto M^{-1/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^{5/3}
\Rightarrow R = C \cdot M^{-1/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^{5/3}
$$
for some constant $ C $.

Now, **average density**:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
\propto \frac{M}{R^3}
$$

Substitute $ R^3 \propto M^{-1} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^5 $, so:
$$
\rho \propto \frac{M}{M^{-1} (Z/A)^5} = M^2 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5
$$

Thus:
$$
\rho \propto M^2 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5
$$

Now, let's find the full expression.

---

### Step 5: Compute the density explicitly

We go back to pressure balance.

From hydrostatic equilibrium, we can estimate:
$$
P_{\text{deg}} \sim \frac{|U_{\text{grav}}|}{R}
\Rightarrow \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} n_e^{5/3} \sim \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R^4}
$$

Now, $ n_e = \frac{N_e}{V} = \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} \cdot \frac{Z M}{A m_p} $

So:
$$
n_e^{5/3} = \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5}
$$

Plug into pressure:
$$
P_{\text{deg}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5}
$$

Set equal to:
$$
P_{\text{grav}} \sim \frac{G M^2}{R^4}
$$
(ignoring numerical factors)

So:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} \left( \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-5} \sim \frac{G M^2}{R^4}
$$

Cancel $ R^{-4} $ from both sides:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} \left( \frac{Z M}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} R^{-1} \sim G M^2
$$

Solve for $ R $:
$$
R \sim \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

Now, density:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \propto \frac{M}{R^3}
= M \cdot \left[ \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} M^{1/3} \right]^3
= M \cdot \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M
= \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 m_p^5 M^2
$$

So:
$$
\rho = C \cdot M^2 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5
$$
where $ C $ is a constant involving $ G, \hbar, m_e, m_p $

To write it cleanly:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{3}{\pi} \right)^{2/3} \frac{1}{m_p} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right) \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \right)^{3/2} \left( \frac{M}{m_p} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \text{(scaling factor)}
}
$$

Wait — this is getting inconsistent due to approximations.

Actually, from standard white dwarf theory, the **density scales as**:

$$
\rho \propto M^{2} \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5
$$

And the **exact proportionality** can be derived, but the problem asks for **""the value of the density""** in terms of $ M, A, Z $, and fundamental constants.

So we can write:

---

### Final Answer:

The **average density** $ \rho $ of a white dwarf in equilibrium, supported by non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure, is given by:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{3 M}{4\pi R^3}
}
$$
where the radius $ R $ is determined from minimizing energy, leading to:

$$
R = \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e m_p^{5/3}} \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^{5/3} \frac{1}{M^{1/3}} \cdot k
$$
with $ k $ a dimensionless constant of order unity.

Thus,
$$
R^3 = \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e m_p^{5/3}} \right)^3 \left( \frac{Z}{A} \right)^5 \frac{1}{M} \cdot k^3
$$

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{R^3} = \frac{3M}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{G m_e m_p^{5/3}}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M \cdot \frac{1}{k^3}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi k^3} \left( \frac{G m_e m_p^{5/3}}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

This shows that the **density is proportional to $ M^2 (A/Z)^5 $**.

To give a clean symbolic expression without undetermined constants, we write:

$$
\boxed{
\rho \propto \left( \frac{G^3 m_e^3 m_p^5}{\hbar^6} \right) \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 M^2
}
$$

Or, solving for the proportionality:

From earlier balance:
$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \frac{1}{R} \sim G M^2
\Rightarrow R \sim \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} M^{-1/3}
$$

Then:
$$
R^3 \sim \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{G m_e} \right)^3 \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^5 M^{-1}
$$

So:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{(4/3)\pi R^3} \sim \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{M}{R^3} = \frac{3}{4\pi} M \cdot \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 M
$$

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 m_p^5 M^2
}
$$

This is the **final expression** for the density of a white dwarf in terms of $ M, A, Z $, and fundamental constants.

### ✅ Final Boxed Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{G m_e}{\hbar^2} \right)^3 \left( \frac{A}{Z} \right)^5 (m_p)^5 M^2
}
$$

This is the **density** of a white dwarf star supported by non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure, expressed in terms of the total mass $ M $, atomic mass number $ A $, atomic number $ Z $, and fundamental constants $ G, \hbar, m_e, m_p $.","White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is an outward one exerted by the electrons inside the star, which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. We can find its value by the following formula, which is derived from the theory of fermion gases:

$pelectron = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{\hbar^2}{5m_e}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}n^{5/3}$

where $n$ is the number density of electrons in the star. This pressure balances the inward gravitational pressure, which is given by

$p_{grav} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \ \Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

where $\Omega$ is the value of the total potential energy of the star.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, what is the density value of the white dwarf in function of its total mass $M$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?","According to: 

To obtain the electron pressure in function of the density, we can use that $n = N_e/V = (ZN)/V$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in the star.

Conclude:

- The magnetic field produced by a dipole $ \vec{m} $ at position $ \vec{r} $ is:
  $$
  \vec{B}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1

where $ \vec{B}_1 $ is the magnetic field produced by $ \vec{m}_1 $ at the position of $ \vec{m}_2 $, i.e.,

$$
\vec{B}_1 = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}

### Interpretation in Context of the 21 cm Line:

Although the problem begins by discussing the 21 cm hydrogen line due to hyperfine splitting, and mentions the magnetic moments of the electron and proton, the actual question is purely classical: **to compute the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles**.

In quantum mechanics, the hyperfine splitting in hydrogen arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and that of the proton. The energy difference between the aligned and anti-aligned spin states gives rise to the 21 cm photon upon transition.

The classical dipole-dipole interaction energy we just derived,
$$
U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right],
$$
is analogous to the **dipole-dipole part of the hyperfine interaction** in quantum mechanics. However, in the hydrogen atom, the electron is not at a fixed separation from the proton — it is in an orbital, so one must average this interaction over the electron's probability distribution. For the ground state (spherically symmetric), the **contact term** (from the delta-function part of the dipole field) dominates for s-states, and the energy shift becomes:
$$
\Delta E \propto \frac{8\pi}{3} \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 |\psi(0)|^2
$$
which leads to the actual hyperfine splitting.

But since the question **only asks** to use the two given classical formulas to compute the interaction energy between two dipoles, and **does not** ask to compute the hyperfine splitting or the 21 cm energy, we stop here.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}

We are told to:
- Use the classical dipole field:  
  $$
  \vec{B}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}

- Compute the interaction energy $ U_{\text{int}} $ between $ \vec{m}_1 $ and $ \vec{m}_2 $
- The system is nonlinear, but we are to linearize it under the current conditions.

Let’s proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Magnetic field due to dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at the location of $ \vec{m}_2 $

Assume $ \vec{m}_1 $ is at the origin, and $ \vec{m}_2 $ is located at position $ \vec{r} = r \hat{r} $. The magnetic field produced by $ \vec{m}_1 $ at $ \vec{r} $ is:

$$
\vec{B}_{1 \to 2} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

---

### Step 2: Interaction energy of $ \vec{m}_2 $ in this field

The potential energy of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ in the field $ \vec{B}_{1 \to 2} $ is:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_{1 \to 2}
$$

Substitute $ \vec{B}_{1 \to 2} $:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right)
$$

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

So we get the standard expression for the dipole-dipole interaction energy:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
$$

(Note the sign flip due to the negative sign in the energy formula and distribution.)

---

### Step 3: Interpret ""linearize it under the current conditions""

The problem mentions: ""Assume the system is nonlinear, but linearize it under the current conditions.""

But **what nonlinearity** are we referring to?

In this context, the dipole-dipole interaction energy $ U_{\text{int}} $ is already a **bilinear** function of $ \vec{m}_1 $ and $ \vec{m}_2 $, and depends on their orientations. It is not a nonlinear differential equation or a dynamical system here — we are computing a static interaction energy.

Moreover, in quantum mechanics, the hyperfine interaction that gives rise to the 21 cm line is derived from this classical dipole-dipole interaction, but averaged over atomic orbitals (since the electron is not at a point), and then quantized.

But the question asks us to **use classical dipoles**, so we are to stay within classical electromagnetism.

Now, the phrase ""linearize it"" is ambiguous here. In physics, ""linearizing"" usually means approximating a nonlinear system (e.g., equations of motion) around an equilibrium point. But here, we are just computing a potential energy between two fixed dipoles.

Alternatively, if the dipoles were dynamic (e.g., precessing in each other's fields), we might linearize equations of motion. But no dynamics are given.

Also, the problem says ""Set the observation error model $ E(t) = 0 $"", which seems irrelevant or possibly a red herring, as no observation model was otherwise discussed.

Given all this, the most reasonable interpretation is:

- Compute the classical dipole-dipole interaction energy.
- The expression we derived is exact for static classical dipoles.
- There is **no obvious nonlinearity to linearize** in the energy expression itself unless we are considering small deviations from an equilibrium configuration.

But **no specific configuration or dynamics** are given to linearize **around**.

Hence, unless more context is provided (e.g., small oscillations of dipole orientations), ""linearize"" cannot be meaningfully applied to the energy expression itself.

However, in many contexts (especially in deriving the hyperfine interaction), the **orientation-averaged** interaction is considered, or specific quantum states (parallel vs antiparallel spins) are evaluated.

But the problem says: ""Using these two formulas together, what is the energy $ U_{\text{int}} $...""

So likely, the expected answer is the **classical dipole-dipole interaction energy**, which we have derived.

The mention of ""linearize"" might be a misdirection or poorly phrased, but since no variables are evolving and no equations of motion are given, we cannot perform a meaningful linearization of dynamics.

Moreover, the energy expression is already linear in each dipole moment (bilinear), so it's ""linear"" in that sense.

---

### Final Answer

The interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles $ \vec{m}_1 $ and $ \vec{m}_2 $ separated by $ \vec{r} = r \hat{r} $ is:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) (\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
$$

This is the standard classical dipole-dipole interaction energy. Given the lack of a dynamical system or equilibrium point to expand around, no further linearization is applicable or necessary. Thus, this is the final result.","Using these two formulas together,g.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment. a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

This is a classic problem in electromagnetism and is directly relevant to the **hyperfine splitting** in hydrogen, which gives rise to the **21 cm spectral line**.

---

### Step 1: Magnetic field of a dipole

The magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at a position $ \vec{r} $ relative to it is given by:

$$
\vec{B}_2(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \left[ \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

This is the field at the location of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $, created by $ \vec{m}_1 $.

---

### Step 2: Potential energy of a dipole in an external field

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ in an external magnetic field $ \vec{B} $ is:

$$
U = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}
$$

Substituting the field created by $ \vec{m}_1 $, we get the interaction energy:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_2 = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right)
$$

So,

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]
$$

---

### Final Expression:

$$
\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{1}{r^3} \left[ \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 - 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) \right]}
$$

(Note: The negative sign in the energy definition flips the signs, so we write it in the conventional form.)

### Interpretation in the Context of Hydrogen (Hyperfine Splitting)

In a hydrogen atom, the electron and proton each have intrinsic magnetic moments due to their spin:

- $ \vec{m}_e = -g_e \mu_B \frac{\vec{S}_e}{\hbar} $ (electron)
- $ \vec{m}_p = g_p \mu_p \frac{\vec{S}_p}{\hbar} $ (proton)

But for the purpose of estimating the interaction energy, we treat them as classical magnetic dipoles interacting via the above formula.

The **hyperfine interaction energy** depends on the relative orientation of the two spins (and hence magnetic moments). The two states are:

- **Triplet state**: spins parallel → higher magnetic interaction energy
- **Singlet state**: spins antiparallel → lower energy

The energy difference between these states corresponds to a photon with wavelength ~21 cm.

However, the question only asks for the **interaction energy** $ U_{\text{int}} $ between two magnetic dipoles $ \vec{m}_1 $, $ \vec{m}_2 $ separated by $ \vec{r} $. This is precisely what we have derived.

### Final Answer:

$$

**Reasoning:** The given text is a highly disordered and incoherent collection of phrases related to atomic physics, magnetic moments, dipole interactions, and the hydrogen atom. While terms like ""magnetic moment,"" ""electron,"" ""proton,"" ""hyperfine splitting,"" ""21 cm line,"" and ""dipole-dipole interaction"" suggest the topic is about the hyperfine structure in hydrogen due to electron-proton spin interaction, the actual **question** is impossible to extract with certainty.

The final sentence — ""spins r\hat{r}$?"" — is clearly malformed and cut off. There is no clear question being asked (e.g., ""Calculate the energy difference..."", ""Derive the interaction energy..."", or ""What is the wavelength..."").

Although one might guess that the intended question is to **derive the interaction energy $ U_{\text{int}} $ between the magnetic dipoles of the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom separated by $ \vec{r} = r\hat{r} $**, the text does not clearly ask this. Since the task requires either solving a well-defined problem or declaring it unsolvable, and due to the **severe grammatical and structural corruption** of the input, it is not possible to confidently reconstruct the intended question.

Therefore, the correct response is: **Unsolvable**.","The 21cm spectral line of hydrogen is a result of the interaction between the electron's and proton's quantum mechanical spin (known as hyperfine splitting). The spins can be either aligned or anti-aligned. When a hydrogen atom decays from the higher energy state to the lower energy state, a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference in these two states. The intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron $\mu_e$ is approximately equal to the Bohr magneton $\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$, and the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is roughly $2.8 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$. Electrons and protons (and any particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$) have permanent magnetic dipole moments $\vec{m}$ with magnitude equal to the intrinsic magnetic moment.

Consider two classical magnetic dipoles $\vec{m}_1, \vec{m}_2$ separated by a distance $\vec{r} = r\hat{r}$. The magnetic field from a perfect magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is

$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m} \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}}{r^3}$

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$ (e.g., the field created by the other dipole) is $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.

This is analogous to the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, but we are not necessarily assuming quantization—just classical circular motion under electrostatic force.

---

### Step 1: Coulomb Force Provides Centripetal Force

For a circular orbit, the Coulomb attraction provides the necessary centripetal force:

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
$$

where:
- $ k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} $ is Coulomb's constant,
- $ e $ is the elementary charge,
- $ v $ is the orbital speed of the electron,
- $ r $ is the orbital radius.

Simplify:

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r} \Rightarrow k e^2 = m_e v^2 r
\quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total Energy of the Electron

The total energy $ E $ is the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and electrostatic potential energy (PE):

$$
E = \text{KE} + \text{PE} = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

From Equation 1: $ m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r} $, so:

$$
\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

Thus,

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k e^2}{r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

So, the **total energy** is:

$$
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k e^2}{r}} \quad \text{where } k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}
$$

Alternatively, we can write it as:

$$
E = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r}
$$

But since the problem says to use $ e $ for charge and doesn't specify whether to include $ \varepsilon_0 $, and often in atomic physics $ k $ is used implicitly, we can keep $ k $ for simplicity unless told otherwise.

---

### Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum

The angular momentum $ L $ of the electron (assuming circular orbit) is:

$$
L = m_e v r
$$

We can express $ v $ in terms of $ r $ using Equation 1:

From $ m_e v^2 r = k e^2 $, we get:

$$
v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r} \Rightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}
$$

Then:

$$
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e^2 r^2 \cdot \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r k e^2}
$$

So,

$$
\boxed{L = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}}
$$

This is the classical expression for the magnitude of orbital angular momentum.

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy:** $ \boxed{E = -\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{k e^2}{r}} $
- **Orbital angular momentum:** $ \boxed{L = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}} $

### **Given:**
- An electron (mass $ m_e $) orbits a proton (mass $ m_p $) at a radius $ r $.
- The interaction is purely Coulombic (electrostatic attraction).
- $ m_p \gg m_e $: the proton is much heavier than the electron, so we can assume the proton is stationary (i.e., we are in the **lab frame** where the proton is at rest).
- We are to find:
  1. The **total energy** of the electron.
  2. The **orbital angular momentum** of the electron.
- Use $ e $ for the magnitude of the electric charge (so electron charge is $ -e $, proton is $ +e $).
- A coordinate transformation is mentioned: $ x' = x $, which is trivial (identity transformation in one dimension), but since no further use is made of it, and no vector form is given, we can interpret this as just reaffirming the coordinate system — likely not affecting the physics.

- Note: The variable $ m > 0 $ is mentioned but not used — we can ignore it as a red herring or placeholder.

### **Step 1: Kinetic and Potential Energy**

In a circular orbit under Coulomb attraction, the electron moves in a circular path of radius $ r $ around the (nearly stationary) proton.

#### **Coulomb Force:**
$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}
$$

This provides the centripetal force:
$$
F = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
$$

Equating:
$$
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}
$$

Solving for kinetic energy:
$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} \right)
$$

So,
$$
K = \frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

#### **Potential Energy:**
The electrostatic potential energy between electron and proton is:
$$
U = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

#### **Total Energy:**
$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} - \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Orbital Angular Momentum**

For circular motion, the magnitude of orbital angular momentum $ L $ is:
$$
L = m_e v r
$$

From earlier:
$$
m_e v^2 / r = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\Rightarrow m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
\Rightarrow v = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
$$

So:
$$
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{m_e r} } = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} m_e e^2 r }
$$

Alternatively, leave it in terms of $ v $, but better to simplify:

$$
L = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

---

### **Coordinate Transformation: $ x' = x $**

This is a trivial identity transformation in one coordinate. Since no other coordinates are transformed and the problem is spherically symmetric, this does not alter the physics. It likely serves only to emphasize that we are not changing reference frames in a meaningful way. So we can proceed with the standard expressions.

---

### **Final Answers:**

1. **Total Energy of the electron:**
$$
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}}
$$

2. **Orbital Angular Momentum of the electron:**
$$
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }}
$$

### Step 1: Centripetal Force and Coulomb Force

For a stable circular orbit, the **Coulomb attraction** provides the **centripetal force**:

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
$$

where:
- $ k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} $ is Coulomb's constant,
- $ v $ is the orbital speed of the electron,
- $ r $ is the orbital radius.

Simplify:

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r} \Rightarrow m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Kinetic Energy

The kinetic energy $ K $ of the electron is:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2
$$

Substitute $ m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r} $:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{2r}
$$

---

### Step 3: Potential Energy

The electrostatic potential energy $ U $ between the electron and proton is:

$$
U = -\frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

(negative because it's an attractive force, and zero at infinity)

---

### Step 4: Total Energy

Total energy $ E $ is kinetic + potential:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{k e^2}{2r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}
$$

So the total energy is:

$$
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{2r}}
\quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{E = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}}
$$

---

### Step 5: Orbital Angular Momentum

The orbital angular momentum $ L $ of the electron (a scalar in magnitude for circular orbit) is:

$$
L = m_e v r
$$

We need to express this in terms of $ e $, $ m_e $, $ r $, and constants.

From earlier:

$$
m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}
\Rightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}
$$

Now compute $ L $:

$$
L = m_e v r = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e^2 r^2 \cdot \frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e r k e^2}
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} m_e e^2 r } }
\quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{L = \sqrt{k m_e e^2 r}}
$$

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy of the electron**:
  $$
  E = -\frac{k e^2}{2r}, \quad \text{where } k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}
  $$

- **Orbital angular momentum**:
  $$
  L = \sqrt{k m_e e^2 r}

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

According to:

$\sqrt{3}m_2 > \sqrt{2}(m_1 + m_2) \Leftrightarrow \boxed{m_1 < \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} - 1\right)m_2}$

Conclude: 

Now, one can find the semi-major axis of the orbit of the conglomerate:

According to: 

Moreover, if we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by $e$

Conclude: 

$a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow ae = a - \frac{R}{2}.$

It follows that

$r_{max} = a(1 + e) = 2a - \frac{R}{2} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{r_{max} = \frac{R}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}}$

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum immediately yields

Conclude: 

$v_{min} = v_{max} \frac{r_{min}}{r_{max}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{v_{min} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{m_2(m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}.$","We are given a physics problem involving a collision between a meteorite and a space station orbiting Earth, followed by analysis of the resulting orbit of the combined object (conglomerate). We are to determine several quantities in terms of:

- $ M $: mass of Earth  
- $ G $: gravitational constant  
- $ m_1 $: mass of meteorite  
- $ m_2 $: mass of space station  
- $ R $: radius of the original circular orbit of the space station  

The conglomerate moves in a **closed orbit** with **minimum distance from Earth's center** $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $. We are to:

1. State the **shape of the orbit** of the conglomerate.  
2. Determine:  
   (i) the speed of the meteorite just before collision,  
   (ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,  
   (iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from Earth’s center.  
3. Find the condition that $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ must satisfy for this scenario to be possible.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

- The **space station** is in a **circular orbit** of radius $ R $ around Earth.  
  Its orbital speed is:  
  $$
  v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  $$
  It moves tangentially.

- The **meteorite** is **radially approaching Earth**, so its velocity is purely radial (no angular momentum about Earth’s center).  
  Let its speed just before collision be $ v_1 $ (directed inward, toward Earth).

- Collision occurs at radius $ R $ — the location of the space station’s orbit.  
  The collision is **inelastic** (they stick together), forming a **conglomerate** of mass $ m_1 + m_2 $.

- After collision, the conglomerate is in a **closed orbit** (so bound, elliptical) with **perigee** (closest approach) $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $.  
  We are to find the **apogee** (maximum distance), the speeds, etc.

---

### Step 2: Shape of the orbit

After the collision, the conglomerate is in a **closed orbit** with perigee $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $ and the collision occurs at $ r = R $. Since $ R > R/2 $, the point of collision is **not** the perigee. But the **minimum** distance is $ R/2 $, so the orbit must bring the object closer than $ R $.

Hence, the orbit is **elliptical**, with:

- Perigee: $ r_p = R/2 $  
- Apogee: $ r_a = ? $ (to be determined)

So, **the shape of the orbit is an ellipse**.

---

### Step 3: Conservation laws

We analyze the collision at $ r = R $. Since the collision is sudden, we assume **no external forces act during the short collision time**, so **linear momentum is conserved** at that point.

But note: gravity is acting, but during an instantaneous collision, we neglect the impulse from gravity.

However, **angular momentum about Earth’s center is conserved** during the collision because gravity is radial (central force), so torque is zero.

Also, after the collision, the motion is governed by gravity, so **energy and angular momentum are conserved** along the orbit.

---

### Step 4: (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision

Let’s denote:

- Velocity of space station before collision: $ \vec{v}_2 = v_2 \hat{\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{\theta} $ (tangential)
- Velocity of meteorite: $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \hat{r} $ (radially inward)

After collision, let the velocity of the conglomerate be $ \vec{V} $.

By conservation of **linear momentum** at the point of collision:

$$
m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2 = (m_1 + m_2) \vec{V}
$$

So:

$$
\vec{V} = \frac{m_1 (-v_1 \hat{r}) + m_2 \left( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{\theta} \right)}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

Thus, the conglomerate has both radial and tangential components of velocity after collision:

- $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $
- $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $

Now, after the collision, the conglomerate moves in an elliptical orbit with **perigee $ r_p = R/2 $**.

But the collision occurs at $ r = R $. So $ r = R $ is **not** the perigee — unless the radial velocity is zero there. But here, $ V_r \neq 0 $ (unless $ v_1 = 0 $), so the object is either moving inward or outward at $ r = R $.

But we are told that the **minimum** distance is $ R/2 $, so the object must be **on its way inward** at $ r = R $, and will reach $ r = R/2 $ at perigee.

So $ r = R $ is **not** an apsis (extremum of radial distance) — unless $ V_r = 0 $. But in general, $ V_r \ne 0 $, so $ r = R $ is not an apsis.

Wait — this is a problem.

For an orbit in a central force field (like gravity), the radial velocity $ \dot{r} = 0 $ at **apsides** (perigee and apogee). So if the **minimum** distance is $ R/2 $, then at $ r = R/2 $, $ \dot{r} = 0 $. But at $ r = R $, if $ \dot{r} \ne 0 $, then $ r = R $ is **not** an apsis.

But the collision happens at $ r = R $. So unless $ V_r = 0 $, the object will pass through $ r = R $ with nonzero radial velocity, and later reach $ r = R/2 $.

But the **minimum** distance is $ R/2 $, so the orbit must have perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, and apogee $ r_a \ge R $.

But if the object is at $ r = R $ with inward radial velocity, then $ R $ must be **greater than** the perigee, so $ R > R/2 $, which is fine.

So the orbit has:

- Perigee: $ r_p = R/2 $
- Apogee: $ r_a = ? $ (unknown)
- The object is at $ r = R $, moving inward, on its way to perigee.

But we can use **conservation of angular momentum and energy** for the orbit.

Let’s denote:

After collision, at $ r = R $, the conglomerate has:

- Speed squared:  
  $$
  V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2
  $$

- Angular momentum per unit mass (specific angular momentum):  
  $$
  h = r V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
  $$

In a Keplerian orbit around Earth, the **specific angular momentum** $ h $ is conserved, and for an ellipse:

$$
h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}
$$

Also, the **perigee distance** is:

$$
r_p = a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2}
$$

We can use this to find the orbit.

Let’s define:

Let $ \mu = GM $, the gravitational parameter.

Let $ h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} $

Also, in any orbit, the radial velocity and tangential velocity at a point $ r $ are related to the orbit’s energy and angular momentum.

Alternatively, we can use the **orbit equation**:

$$
r = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

But perhaps better: use the fact that at **perigee**, $ r = r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $, and $ \dot{r} = 0 $.

But we know the state (position and velocity) at $ r = R $, so we can compute the **specific energy** and **specific angular momentum**, then deduce the orbit.

Let’s work with **specific** (per-unit-mass) quantities for the orbit, since gravity doesn't depend on the mass of the orbiting object.

Let $ \vec{v} = \vec{V} $ be the velocity of the conglomerate just after collision.

Then the **specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass) of the orbit is:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

And the **specific angular momentum** is:

$$
h = R V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
$$

For an elliptical orbit:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

Also, the **perigee** is given by:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e)} \quad \text{(minimum r when } \cos\theta = 1 \text{ in orbit equation)}
$$

Wait — standard orbit equation:

$$
r = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 + e \cos(\theta - \theta_0)}
$$

Minimum $ r $ occurs when $ \cos(\cdot) = 1 $, so:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2 / \mu}{1 + e}
$$

We are told $ r_p = R/2 $, so:

$$
\frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e)} = \frac{R}{2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
h^2 = GM \cdot \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
\quad \text{(1)}
$$

But we also have an expression for $ h $:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR
\quad \text{(2)}
$$

Set (1) = (2):

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR = GM \cdot \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
$$

Cancel $ GMR $ from both sides:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1 + e)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
\quad \text{(3)}
$$

Now, $ e < 1 $ for an ellipse, so:

$$
1 + e < 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 < 1 \quad \text{(always true)}
$$

But we need $ e \ge 0 $, so $ 1 + e \ge 1 $, so:

$$
2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \ge 1
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
m_2 \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (m_1 + m_2)
$$

Solve:

$$
m_2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} m_1
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
m_2 \ge \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{1 - 1/\sqrt{2}} m_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} m_1
$$

Rationalize:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} = \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.414
$$

So:
$$
m_2 \ge (\sqrt{2} + 1) m_1
$$

This is a **necessary condition** for $ e \ge 0 $. We will return to this.

But we need to find $ v_1 $, the meteorite’s speed.

We have not yet used energy conservation.

Let’s compute the **specific energy** after collision:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
= \frac{1}{2} \left( V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

We have:

- $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $
- $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $

So:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Thus:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

On the other hand, for an elliptical orbit:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

We can find $ a $ from the perigee and eccentricity.

From earlier:

We have $ r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $

And from equation (3):

$$
1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
$$

Let $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $, so $ 1 + e = 2\mu^2 $

Then $ e = 2\mu^2 - 1 $

Now, $ r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $

So:

$$
a = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} = \frac{R/2}{1 - (2\mu^2 - 1)} = \frac{R/2}{2 - 2\mu^2} = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)}
$$

Now, $ \varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a} = -\frac{GM}{2} \cdot \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} = -\frac{2GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R} $

Now set equal to the expression from velocity:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \mu^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{2GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \mu^2 \frac{GM}{R} - 2\frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{4GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Simplify right-hand side:

$$
-\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{4GM \mu^2}{R}
$$

Left-hand side:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (\mu^2 - 2)
$$

Set equal:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (\mu^2 - 2) = -\frac{4GM}{R} + \frac{4GM \mu^2}{R}
$$

Bring all to left:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (\mu^2 - 2 + 4 - 4\mu^2) = 0
$$

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (2 - 3\mu^2) = 0
$$

But left side has a square term ≥ 0, and $ \frac{GM}{R} > 0 $, so this implies:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

For this to be possible, we need $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \ge 0 $, so:

$$
\mu^2 \ge \frac{2}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \ge \frac{2}{3}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \ge \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 0.816
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2) }
$$

So:

$$
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2) }
$$

But $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $, so $ \mu^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 $

Thus:

$$
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 \right) }
$$

$$
\boxed{
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) }
}
$$

This is the speed of the meteorite just before collision.

But note: the expression under the square root must be non-negative:

$$
\frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \ge 2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
3m_2^2 \ge 2(m_1 + m_2)^2
$$

Let’s solve this inequality:

$$
3m_2^2 \ge 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 + 2m_2^2
$$

$$
3m_2^2 - 2m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 \ge 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 \ge 0
$$

Let $ x = m_2 / m_1 $, then:

$$
x^2 - 4x - 2 \ge 0
$$

Solve $ x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 $:

$$
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 8}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{24}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{6}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{6}
$$

$ \sqrt{6} \approx 2.45 $, so $ x \ge 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.45 $

So $ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1 $

This is **stronger** than the earlier condition from $ e \ge 0 $, which required $ m_2 \ge (\sqrt{2}+1)m_1 \approx 2.41 m_1 $. So this energy condition dominates.

But wait — this would mean $ v_1 $ is real only if $ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 $. But is this physical?

Let’s double-check the energy equation.

We had:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

But $ 3\mu^2 - 2 $ must be ≥ 0 → $ \mu^2 \ge 2/3 $

But earlier from angular momentum and perigee:

$$
1 + e = 2\mu^2
\quad \text{and} \quad e < 1 \Rightarrow 2\mu^2 < 2 \Rightarrow \mu^2 < 1
$$

But also $ e \ge 0 \Rightarrow \mu^2 \ge 1/2 $

Now, for energy to be valid, we need $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \ge 0 \Rightarrow \mu^2 \ge 2/3 \approx 0.666 $

So combining: $ \mu^2 \in [2/3, 1) $

But let’s verify if this makes sense.

Wait — there’s a **problem**: the right-hand side of the energy equation was negative unless $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \ge 0 $, but let's retrace.

We had:

From energy:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

But the left side is ≥ 0, so we must have $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \ge 0 $

But let’s plug in a test value.

Suppose $ m_2 \gg m_1 $, so $ \mu \approx 1 $, then $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \approx 1 $, so $ v_1 \approx \frac{1}{m_1} \cdot m_2 \cdot \sqrt{GM/R} \cdot 1 \to \infty $? No:

Wait:

$$
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2) }
= \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left(3 \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2\right) }
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \cdot \sqrt{ 3 \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 }
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \frac{1}{m_1} \sqrt{ 3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 }
$$

So:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{ 3m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) } }{m_1}
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{ 3m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_2^2 } }{m_1}
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{ m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 } }{m_1}
$$

So for this to be real:

$$
m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 \ge 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1
$$

This seems very large. Is this physical?

Alternatively, perhaps we made a sign error.

Let’s go back.

We had:

From energy balance:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (2 - 3\mu^2) = 0
\quad \text{from earlier step}
$$

Wait, no:

We had:

After simplifying:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \frac{GM}{R} (2 - 3\mu^2) = 0
$$

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

Yes.

But this can only be non-negative if $ 3\mu^2 \ge 2 $.

But let's think physically.

If the meteorite is very light, $ m_1 \ll m_2 $, then $ \mu \approx 1 $, so $ 3\mu^2 - 2 \approx 1 $, and $ v_1 \approx \frac{m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{GM/R} $, which is very large if $ m_1 \ll m_2 $. That makes sense — a small meteorite must be very fast to significantly change the orbit.

But is it possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum distance is not at perigee in the way we think.

Wait — we assumed that the orbit has perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, and used that to get $ h^2 = GM r_p (1 + e) = GM (R/2)(1 + e) $, and set equal to the actual $ h^2 $.

But is that correct?

Yes: $ r_p = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e} \Rightarrow h^2 = GM r_p (1 + e) $

Yes.

And we have $ h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} $

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR = GM \cdot \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
\Rightarrow (1 + e) = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
$$

This is correct.

Now, for the energy, we have a conflict unless $ m_2 $ is large enough.

But let's proceed.

So (i) the speed of the meteorite is:

$$
\boxed{
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) }
}
$$

With the condition that the expression under the square root is non-negative:

$$
\frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \ge 2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
3m_2^2 \ge 2(m_1 + m_2)^2
$$

This is the condition for the scenario to be possible.

But this seems very restrictive. Let's check if there's an error in the energy sign.

Let’s recompute the energy.

After collision, specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
= \frac{1}{2} \left( V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

We have:

- $ V_r = \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $ (magnitude)
- $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GM/R} $

So:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} }{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Orbit energy:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

And $ a = \frac{r_p}{1 - e} = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} $

And $ e = 2\mu^2 - 1 $, $ \mu = m_2/(m_1 + m_2) $

So $ 1 - e = 1 - (2\mu^2 - 1) = 2 - 2\mu^2 = 2(1 - \mu^2) $

So $ a = \frac{R/2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} $

Then:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2} \cdot \frac{4(1 - \mu^2)}{R} = -\frac{2GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Set equal:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{2GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \frac{GM}{R} - 2\frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{4GM(1 - \mu^2)}{R}
$$

Note $ \mu = m_2/(m_1 + m_2) $, so $ \mu^2 = m_2^2/(m_1 + m_2)^2 $

So:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \mu^2 \frac{GM}{R} - 2\frac{GM}{R} = -4\frac{GM}{R} + 4\mu^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Bring all to left:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \mu^2 \frac{GM}{R} - 2\frac{GM}{R} + 4\frac{GM}{R} - 4\mu^2 \frac{GM}{R} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{GM}{R} (2 - 3\mu^2) = 0
$$

Same as before.

So:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = \frac{GM}{R} (3\mu^2 - 2)
$$

So no error.

Therefore, the expression is correct, and the condition is:

$$
3\mu^2 - 2 \ge 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \ge \frac{2}{3}
$$

Or:

$$
\boxed{ m_2 \ge \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} (m_1 + m_2) }
\quad \Rightarrow \quad m_2 \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right) \ge \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} m_1
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_2}{m_1} \ge \frac{\sqrt{2/3}}{1 - \sqrt{2/3}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})}{3 - 2} = \sqrt{6} + 2
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 }
$$

This is the condition.

Now, back to the questions.

---

### (i) Speed of meteorite just before collision:

$$
\boxed{
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) }
}
$$

Valid when $ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 $.

---

### (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate

In an elliptical orbit, speed is maximum at perigee, minimum at apogee.

Perigee: $ r_p = R/2 $

Apogee: $ r_a = ? $

We know for an ellipse:

$$
r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e)
$$

We have $ a = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} $, $ e = 2\mu^2 - 1 $

So:

$$
r_a = a(1 + e) = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} (1 + 2\mu^2 - 1) = \frac{R}{4(1 - \mu^2)} \cdot 2\mu^2 = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)}
$$

Speed at perigee and apogee can be found from conservation of angular momentum:

$$
v_p r_p = v_a r_a = h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} = \mu \sqrt{GMR}
$$

So:

- $ v_{\text{max}} = v_p = \frac{h}{r_p} = \frac{\mu \sqrt{GMR}}{R/2} = 2\mu \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
- $ v_{\text{min}} = v_a = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{\mu \sqrt{GMR}}{r_a} $

But $ r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} $, so:

$$
v_a = \frac{\mu \sqrt{GMR}}{ \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} } = \frac{2(1 - \mu^2)}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{
v_{\text{max}} = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}, \quad
v_{\text{min}} = \frac{2 \left(1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right)}{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} } \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
}
$$

---

### (iii) Maximum distance from Earth’s center

This is the apogee:

$$
r_a = \frac{R \mu^2}{2(1 - \mu^2)} = \frac{R \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2}{2 \left(1 - \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \right)}
$$

$$
\boxed{
r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2 \left( (m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2 \right)} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2)}
}
$$

---

### Condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $:

As derived:

$$
\boxed{ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 }
$$

---

### Summary

- **Orbit shape**: Ellipse
- (i) $ v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{3m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2 \right) } $
- (ii) $ v_{\text{max}} = 2 \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $, $ v_{\text{min}} = \frac{2(1 - \mu^2)}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $ with $ \mu = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $
- (iii) $ r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2)} $
- Condition: $ m_2 \ge (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 $

Note: The problem is solvable, though the condition is stringent.","Assume the boundary conditions always hold, but do not write the expressions.。A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R. For all parts of the question, express your results in terms of the mass M of the Earth, the gravitational constant G, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite, and the mass $m_2$ of the space station.

Assume that, after the impact, the meteorite and the space station form a conglomerate that moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2. State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine:

(i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision,
(ii) the minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
(iii) the maximum distance of the conglomerate from the center of the Earth.

Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.。Define multiple parameter sets, but they ultimately cancel each other out.。","We are given a physical scenario involving a collision between a radially infalling meteorite and a space station in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around Earth. After the collision, the combined object (conglomerate) moves in a **closed orbit** that has a **minimum distance** (perigee) of $ R/2 $ from Earth’s center. We are to determine:

- The **shape** of the orbit,
- (i) the **speed of the meteorite** just before collision,
- (ii) the **minimum and maximum speeds** of the conglomerate,
- (iii) the **maximum distance** (apogee) of the conglomerate,
- and the **condition** on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ for this to be possible.

All answers should be in terms of $ G $, $ M $, $ m_1 $, $ m_2 $.

We are told not to write boundary condition expressions explicitly, and that multiple parameters may be introduced but will cancel.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

- The **space station** is in a **circular orbit** of radius $ R $. So its speed is:
  $$
  v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  $$
  Its velocity is purely tangential.

- The **meteorite** is **radially approaching** Earth. So its velocity just before collision is purely **radial** (inward), say $ v_1 $, which we are to determine.

- The **collision** is **inelastic** (they stick together), forming a **conglomerate** of mass $ m_1 + m_2 $.

- After collision, the conglomerate is in a **closed orbit** (so bound, elliptical) with **perigee** $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $.

- Since the orbit is closed and has perigee $ R/2 $, and the collision occurs at $ r = R $, this suggests that $ r = R $ is **not** the perigee (since $ R > R/2 $), so $ r = R $ must be the **apogee** (maximum distance) **only if** the orbit were symmetric — but wait: the perigee is $ R/2 $, and the collision happens at $ R $. So unless the orbit has perigee $ R/2 $ and apogee $ R $, the point $ R $ is **not** the apogee.

But here's the key: **the orbit reaches a minimum distance of $ R/2 $**, and the collision occurs at $ R $. So $ R $ is **greater than** the perigee. Therefore, the point $ r = R $ (where collision occurs) must be **either** the apogee **or** some intermediate point.

But since the collision imparts a new velocity vector at $ r = R $, and the resulting orbit has perigee $ R/2 $, then $ r = R $ is a point on the orbit, and the **minimum** distance is $ R/2 $. So the **maximum** distance (apogee) could be $ R $ **only if** the radial component of velocity after collision is zero at $ r = R $, or it could be larger.

But we are told the orbit **approaches the center at minimum distance $ R/2 $** — so perigee $ = R/2 $. The apogee is unknown; we are to **find** it.

So the orbit is **elliptical**, with perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, and apogee $ r_a = ? $, to be determined.

But we can determine the orbit **after** the collision from the **position** and **velocity** just after impact at $ r = R $. So we need to compute the post-collision velocity using conservation of **linear momentum** (since no external forces act during the brief collision).

---

### Step 2: Conservation of momentum at collision

At the moment of collision:

- Position: $ r = R $
- Space station velocity: tangential, magnitude $ v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
- Meteorite velocity: radial inward, magnitude $ v_1 $ (to be found)

Let us define:
- Tangential direction: $ \hat{\theta} $
- Radial direction: $ \hat{r} $ (outward)

Then:
- $ \vec{v}_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \, \hat{\theta} $
- $ \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \, \hat{r} $

After collision, the conglomerate has velocity $ \vec{V} $, given by conservation of linear momentum:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) \vec{V} = m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2 = -m_1 v_1 \hat{r} + m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{\theta}
$$

So:
$$
\vec{V} = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \hat{r} + \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \hat{\theta}
$$

So the post-collision velocity has:
- Radial component: $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $ (inward)
- Tangential component: $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $

This velocity, at radius $ R $, defines the orbit of the conglomerate.

---

### Step 3: Shape of the orbit

The orbit is **bound** (closed), and has perigee $ r_p = R/2 $. Since the motion is under inverse-square gravity, the orbit is a **conic section**. Closed orbit ⇒ **ellipse**.

So the **shape** is an **ellipse** with Earth at one focus.

Answer: **The orbit is elliptical.**

---

### Step 4: Use orbital mechanics to relate post-collision state to orbit parameters

For a Keplerian orbit under gravity, the following are conserved:

- **Specific angular momentum**: $ h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = r V_\theta $
- **Specific mechanical energy**: $ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{r} $

Let us compute these **per unit mass** for the conglomerate (since orbit depends only on velocity and position, not on mass of orbiting body).

Let $ \mu = m_1 + m_2 $, but since we are computing specific (per-unit-mass) quantities, we can ignore $ \mu $.

At $ r = R $, just after collision:

- $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} $
- $ V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
- So speed squared: 
  $$
  V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2
  $$

- Specific angular momentum:
  $$
  h = r V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR}
  $$

- Specific energy:
  $$
  \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
  = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} }{\mu^2} \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
  $$

But we also know that for an **elliptical orbit**, the **perigee** and **apogee** are given by:

$$
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e)}, \quad r_{\text{max}} = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 - e)}
$$

where $ e $ is eccentricity.

We are told $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $. So:

$$
\frac{R}{2} = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 + e)}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad h^2 = \frac{GM R}{2} (1 + e)
\tag{1}
$$

But we also have an expression for $ h $:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} GMR
\tag{2}
$$

Set (1) = (2):

$$
\frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} GMR = \frac{GM R}{2} (1 + e)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} = \frac{1}{2} (1 + e)
\tag{3}
$$

So:
$$
1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1
\tag{4}
$$

Now, since eccentricity must satisfy $ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for an ellipse, we will use this later for the condition.

Now, the **apogee** is:
$$
r_{\text{max}} = \frac{h^2}{GM(1 - e)}
$$

We can compute this once we have $ h^2 $ and $ e $, but let's hold off.

But we can also use the fact that for an ellipse:
$$
r_{\text{min}} = a(1 - e), \quad r_{\text{max}} = a(1 + e)
$$

So:
$$
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{R}{2} = a(1 - e), \quad r_{\text{max}} = a(1 + e)
\Rightarrow \frac{r_{\text{max}}}{r_{\text{min}}} = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\Rightarrow r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

So once we know $ e $, we can find $ r_{\text{max}} $. But $ e $ depends on $ m_1, m_2 $ via equation (4).

But we also need to determine $ v_1 $, the meteorite speed before collision.

To do that, we need another condition: the **energy** or **angular momentum** must be consistent. But we already used angular momentum to get $ e $. We now use the fact that the **orbit has perigee $ R/2 $**, which we used, but we can now use **energy** to find $ v_1 $.

Alternatively, we can use the **radial velocity** at $ r = R $.

But here's a better idea: at any point in the orbit, the radial velocity is given by:

$$
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{e \sqrt{GM}}{\sqrt{p}} \sin \theta
$$

But perhaps more systematically, from orbit equation:

$$
r = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

Let’s set $ \theta = 0 $ at perigee. Then at perigee, $ r = r_{\text{min}} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e} = R/2 $

We are at a point where $ r = R $. So:

$$
R = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{h^2}{GM R}
$$

But from earlier, $ h^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} GMR $, so:

$$
\frac{h^2}{GM R} = \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + e \cos \theta = \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2
\tag{5}
$$

But from equation (3): $ \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + e) $

So:
$$
1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + e)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad e \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + e) - 1 = \frac{1 + e - 2}{2} = \frac{e - 1}{2}
$$

So:
$$
\cos \theta = \frac{e - 1}{2e}
\tag{6}
$$

Now, the radial velocity is:
$$
\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta} \right) = \frac{h^2 / GM}{(1 + e \cos \theta)^2} \cdot e \sin \theta \cdot \dot{\theta}
$$

But $ \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2} $, so:

$$
\dot{r} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{(1 + e \cos \theta)^2} \cdot e \sin \theta \cdot \frac{h}{r^2}
$$

But $ r = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta} $, so $ r^2 = \left( \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta} \right)^2 $

Thus:
$$
\dot{r} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{(1 + e \cos \theta)^2} \cdot e \sin \theta \cdot \frac{h}{ \left( \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta} \right)^2 } = e h \sin \theta \cdot \frac{GM}{h^2}
= \frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta
$$

So:
$$
\dot{r} = \frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta
$$

We know $ \dot{r} $ just after collision is $ V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} $ (inward, so negative)

So:
$$
-\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} = \frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta
\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} = -\frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta
\tag{7}
$$

Now, from earlier, we have $ \cos \theta = \frac{e - 1}{2e} $, so we can find $ \sin \theta $:

$$
\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \left( \frac{e - 1}{2e} \right)^2
= 1 - \frac{(e - 1)^2}{4e^2} = \frac{4e^2 - (e^2 - 2e + 1)}{4e^2} = \frac{4e^2 - e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2} = \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2}
$$

Now, we also have $ h = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR} $

So plug into (7):

$$
\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} = \frac{e GM}{h} |\sin \theta| \quad \text{(since LHS positive, and } \sin \theta \text{ could be positive or negative, but magnitude)}
$$

Actually, since $ \dot{r} < 0 $, and $ \frac{e GM}{h} > 0 $, we must have $ \sin \theta < 0 $, so $ \sin \theta = - \sqrt{ \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2} } $

So:
$$
\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} = \frac{e GM}{h} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2} } = \frac{GM}{h} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
$$

Now plug in $ h = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR} $:

$$
\frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} = \frac{GM}{ \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
= \frac{GM \mu}{m_2 \sqrt{GMR}} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
= \frac{\mu}{m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ \mu / m_1 $:

$$
v_1 = \frac{\mu}{m_1} \cdot \frac{\mu}{m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
= \frac{\mu^2}{m_1 m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1}
$$

But recall from earlier that $ e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 - 1 $

Let’s define $ \alpha = \frac{m_2}{\mu} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $, so $ \frac{m_1}{\mu} = 1 - \alpha $

Then:
$$
e = 2\alpha^2 - 1
$$

Now compute $ 3e^2 + 2e - 1 $:

First, $ e = 2\alpha^2 - 1 $

So:
$$
e^2 = (2\alpha^2 - 1)^2 = 4\alpha^4 - 4\alpha^2 + 1
$$
$$
3e^2 = 12\alpha^4 - 12\alpha^2 + 3
$$
$$
2e = 4\alpha^2 - 2
$$
Add:
$$
3e^2 + 2e - 1 = 12\alpha^4 - 12\alpha^2 + 3 + 4\alpha^2 - 2 - 1 = 12\alpha^4 - 8\alpha^2
= 4\alpha^2 (3\alpha^2 - 2)
$$

So:
$$
\sqrt{3e^2 + 2e - 1} = \sqrt{4\alpha^2 (3\alpha^2 - 2)} = 2\alpha \sqrt{3\alpha^2 - 2}
\quad \text{(assuming } 3\alpha^2 - 2 \geq 0 \text{ for real)}
$$

Now plug back into $ v_1 $:

$$
v_1 = \frac{\mu^2}{m_1 m_2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot 2\alpha \sqrt{3\alpha^2 - 2}
= \frac{\mu^2}{m_1 m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \alpha \sqrt{3\alpha^2 - 2}
$$

But $ \alpha = \frac{m_2}{\mu} $, so $ \alpha \mu^2 = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \cdot \mu^2 = m_2 \mu $

Thus:
$$
v_1 = \frac{m_2 \mu}{m_1 m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{3\alpha^2 - 2}
= \frac{\mu}{m_1} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{3\alpha^2 - 2}
$$

But $ \mu = m_1 + m_2 $, $ \alpha = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $, so $ \alpha^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} $

So:
$$
3\alpha^2 - 2 = 3 \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 2
$$

And $ \frac{\mu}{m_1} = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} $

Thus:
$$
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \cdot \sqrt{ 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 }
$$

But wait — the expression under the square root: $ 3\alpha^2 - 2 $, must be **non-negative**, so:
$$
3\alpha^2 - 2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow \alpha^2 \geq \frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \geq \frac{2}{3}
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \geq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 0.816
$$

But this is a condition — we’ll return to it.

However, notice that $ 3\alpha^2 - 2 $ could be negative, which would make $ v_1 $ imaginary — unphysical. So for the scenario to be possible, we must have:
$$
3\alpha^2 - 2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow \alpha^2 \geq \frac{2}{3}
$$

But let's go back — we have a better way.

Wait — we have an issue: earlier we had $ \sin^2 \theta = \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2} $, which must be $ \geq 0 $, so $ 3e^2 + 2e - 1 \geq 0 $

Solve $ 3e^2 + 2e - 1 = 0 $: discriminant $ 4 + 12 = 16 $, roots $ e = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{6} \Rightarrow e = \frac{1}{3}, -1 $

So $ 3e^2 + 2e - 1 \geq 0 $ when $ e \leq -1 $ or $ e \geq 1/3 $

But $ e \geq 0 $ for ellipse, and $ e < 1 $. So we need $ e \geq 1/3 $

From earlier: $ e = 2\alpha^2 - 1 \geq 1/3 \Rightarrow 2\alpha^2 \geq 4/3 \Rightarrow \alpha^2 \geq 2/3 \Rightarrow \alpha \geq \sqrt{2/3} $

So indeed, $ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \geq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} $

But let's now realize: perhaps we can avoid this complexity.

Let’s try a **different approach** using **energy and angular momentum**.

---

### Alternate and Simpler Approach

Let’s denote:

After collision, the conglomerate has:

- Specific angular momentum: $ h = R V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{GMR} $

- Specific energy: $ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} (V_r^2 + V_\theta^2) - \frac{GM}{R} $

For an elliptical orbit with perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, we can compute the **semi-major axis** and **eccentricity** from $ h $ and $ \varepsilon $, but better: we know that the **minimum distance** is $ R/2 $, and it occurs when $ \dot{r} = 0 $.

But at $ r = R $, $ \dot{r} \neq 0 $ (since meteorite had radial velocity), so $ r = R $ is not perigee or apogee.

But we can use the **orbit equation**:

$$
r = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

Set $ \theta = 0 $ at perigee. Then at perigee, $ r = r_p = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e} = \frac{R}{2} $

So:
$$
\frac{h^2}{GM} = \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
\tag{A}
$$

But we also have $ h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 GMR $, so:
$$
\frac{h^2}{GM} = \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 R
\tag{B}
$$

Set (A) = (B):
$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 R = \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
\Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1 + e)
\Rightarrow e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 - 1
\tag{C}
$$

Now, the radial velocity at any point is:
$$
\dot{r} = \frac{e h}{p} \sin \theta, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h^2}{GM}
$$

But earlier we had $ \dot{r} = \frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta $

Yes.

At the point $ r = R $, we have:
$$
R = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\Rightarrow 1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{h^2}{GM R} = \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2
$$

But from (C): $ \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1 + e) $, so:
$$
1 + e \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + e)
\Rightarrow e \cos \theta = \frac{1 + e}{2} - 1 = \frac{e - 1}{2}
\Rightarrow \cos \theta = \frac{e - 1}{2e}
$$

Then:
$$
\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \left( \frac{e - 1}{2e} \right)^2 = \frac{4e^2 - (e^2 - 2e + 1)}{4e^2} = \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2}
$$

Now, $ \dot{r} = \frac{e GM}{h} \sin \theta $, and $ \dot{r} = V_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} $

So:
$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{e GM}{h} \right)^2 \sin^2 \theta = \left( \frac{e^2 G^2 M^2}{h^2} \right) \cdot \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4e^2} = \frac{G^2 M^2}{h^2} \cdot \frac{3e^2 + 2e - 1}{4}
$$

So:
$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} \right)^2 = \frac{G^2 M^2}{4 h^2} (3e^2 + 2e - 1)
$$

But $ h^2 = \frac{m_2^2}{\mu^2} GMR $, so:
$$
\frac{1}{h^2} = \frac{\mu^2}{m_2^2 GMR}
$$

Thus:
$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{\mu} \right)^2 = \frac{G^2 M^2}{4} \cdot \frac{\mu^2}{m_2^2 GMR} \cdot (3e^2 + 2e - 1) = \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{\mu^2}{m_2^2} (3e^2 + 2e - 1)
$$

Multiply both sides by $ \mu^2 / m_1^2 $:
$$
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{\mu^4}{m_1^2 m_2^2} (3e^2 + 2e - 1)
$$

But from (C): $ e = 2 (m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $, so let $ \beta = m_2/\mu $, then $ e = 2\beta^2 - 1 $, and $ m_1/\mu = 1 - \beta $

So $ \mu / m_1 = 1/(1 - \beta) $, $ \mu / m_2 = 1/\beta $

So $ \mu^2 / (m_1 m_2) = \mu / ( (1 - \beta) \beta \mu ) = 1/( \beta (1 - \beta) ) $

But better:
$$
\frac{\mu^4}{m_1^2 m_2^2} = \left( \frac{\mu^2}{m_1 m_2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\mu}{m_1} \cdot \frac{\mu}{m_2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{(1 - \beta) \beta} \right)^2
$$

And $ 3e^2 + 2e - 1 = 3(2\beta^2 - 1)^2 + 2(2\beta^2 - 1) - 1 = 3(4\beta^4 - 4\beta^2 + 1) + 4\beta^2 - 2 - 1 = 12\beta^4 - 12\beta^2 + 3 + 4\beta^2 - 3 = 12\beta^4 - 8\beta^2 $

So:
$$
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{1}{\beta^2 (1 - \beta)^2} \cdot (12\beta^4 - 8\beta^2) = \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{12\beta^4 - 8\beta^2}{\beta^2 (1 - \beta)^2} = \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{12\beta^2 - 8}{(1 - \beta)^2}
$$

$$
= \frac{GM}{4R} \cdot \frac{4(3\beta^2 - 2)}{(1 - \beta)^2} = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{3\beta^2 - 2}{(1 - \beta)^2}
$$

But $ \beta = m_2 / (m_1 + m_2) $, $ 1 - \beta = m_1 / (m_1 + m_2) $

So $ (1 - \beta)^2 = m_1^2 / (m_1 + m_2)^2 $

Thus:
$$
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot (3\beta^2 - 2) \cdot \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1^2}
= \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \left( 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 \right) \cdot \left( \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \right)^2
$$

So:
$$
v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \sqrt{ 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 }
$$

This is real only if:
$$
3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \geq \frac{2}{3}
$$

So the condition is:
$$
\frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \geq \frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \geq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \Rightarrow m_2 \geq \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} (m_1 + m_2)
\Rightarrow m_2 (1 - \sqrt{2/3}) \geq \sqrt{2/3} m_1
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq \frac{\sqrt{2/3}}{1 - \sqrt{2/3}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}/3}{1 - \sqrt{6}/3} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3 - \sqrt{6}} \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{6}}{3 + \sqrt{6}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}(3 + \sqrt{6})}{9 - 6} = \frac{3\sqrt{6} + 6}{3} = \sqrt{6} + 2
$$

So $ \frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 2 + 2.449 = 4.449 $

So the space station must be much more massive than the meteorite.

Now, for the other parts.

### (i) Speed of meteorite before collision

$$
\boxed{v_1 = \frac{m_1 + m_2}{m_1} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} } \sqrt{ 3 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 2 }}
$$

---

### (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate

In an elliptical orbit, speed is maximum at perigee, minimum at apogee.

Use vis-viva equation:

$$
v^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

First, find semi-major axis $ a $.

We know $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $, $ r_{\text{max}} = ? $, but we can find $ a $ from energy.

From earlier, specific energy $ \varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a} $

But also, $ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R} $, but we can use $ r_{\text{min}} $ and $ r_{\text{max}} $.

From earlier, $ r_{\text{min}} = a(1 - e) = R/2 $

And $ e = 2 (m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $, so once e is known, $ a = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} $

Then:
- $ v_{\text{max}} = v_{\text{perigee}} = \sqrt{ GM \left( \frac{2}{r_p} - \frac{1}{a} \right) } = \sqrt{ GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{2(1 - e)}{R} \right) } = \sqrt{ GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{2(1 - e)}{R} \right) } = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (4 - 2 + 2e) } = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} (2 + 2e) } = \sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{R} (1 + e) } $

Similarly, $ v_{\text{min}} = v_{\text{apogee}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{R} \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } $? No.

Better: at apogee, $ r_a = a(1 + e) $, so:

$$
v_a^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r_a} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{GM}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right) = \frac{GM}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
$$

But $ a = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} $, so:

$$
v_a^2 = GM \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \cdot \frac{2(1 - e)}{R} = \frac{2GM}{R} \cdot \frac{(1 - e)^2}{1 + e}
$$

Similarly, $ v_p^2 = \frac{2GM}{R} \cdot \frac{(1 + e)^2}{1 - e} $? Let's check:

Earlier: $ v_p^2 = \frac{2GM}{R} (1 + e) $, and since $ a = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} $, then:

$$
v_p^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{2(1 - e)}{R} \right) = \frac{2GM}{R} (2 - (1 - e)) = \frac{2GM}{R} (1 + e)
$$

Yes.

So:
- $ v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{R} (1 + e) } $
- $ v_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{R} \cdot \frac{(1 - e)^2}{1 + e} } $

With $ e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1 $

---

### (iii) Maximum distance

$ r_{\text{max}} = a(1 + e) = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} (1 + e) = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} $

---

### Condition on $ m_1, m_2 $

As above:
$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \geq \frac{2}{3}
$$

Or:
$$
\frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq \sqrt{6} + 2
$$

---

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

#### Space station before collision:
- In **circular orbit** of radius $ R $.
- Orbital speed:  
  $$
  v_{\text{circ}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  $$
- Velocity is **tangential** to the orbit.

#### Meteorite before collision:
- **Radially approaching** Earth → its velocity is **purely radial**, no tangential component.
- Let its speed just before collision be $ v_1 $ (to be determined).
- Mass: $ m_1 $

#### Collision:
- Occurs at radius $ R $, since that's where the space station is.
- **Inelastic collision**: they stick together → form a conglomerate of mass $ m_1 + m_2 $.
- Momentum is conserved during the collision (no external forces act during the brief impact).
- But **energy is not conserved** (inelastic).

After collision, the conglomerate has some velocity vector at $ r = R $, and moves in a **closed orbit** with **perigee** (closest approach) $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $.

---

### Step 2: Shape of the orbit

After the collision, the conglomerate is in a **closed orbit** with:
- Perigee $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $
- Apogee $ r_{\text{max}} = ? $ (to be found)
- Since it's a bound orbit under gravity, and closed, it must be an **ellipse** with the Earth at one focus.

So, **the shape of the orbit is an ellipse**.

---

### Step 3: Conservation of momentum during collision

Let’s define coordinates at the point of collision (at radius $ R $):

- Let the space station move in the $ \hat{\theta} $ direction (tangential).
- The meteorite moves radially inward → $ -\hat{r} $ direction.

So:

- Velocity of space station:  
  $$
  \vec{v}_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \, \hat{\theta}
  $$

- Velocity of meteorite:  
  $$
  \vec{v}_1 = -v_1 \, \hat{r}
  $$

After collision, the conglomerate has velocity $ \vec{V} $, with radial and tangential components.

Conservation of linear momentum (vectorially):

$$
(m_1 + m_2)\vec{V} = m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2
= -m_1 v_1 \, \hat{r} + m_2 \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \, \hat{\theta}
$$

So the components of the conglomerate's velocity at $ r = R $ are:

- Radial:  
  $$
  V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2}
  $$

- Tangential:  
  $$
  V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  $$

This velocity vector determines the orbit.

---

### Step 4: Orbital mechanics after collision

We now analyze the orbit of the conglomerate, which has:

- At $ r = R $, it has velocity $ \vec{V} = (V_r, V_\theta) $
- The orbit has **perigee** $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $

But note: **the collision happens at $ r = R $**, and the **closest approach is $ R/2 $**, so $ r = R $ is **not** the perigee. Therefore, the conglomerate must be **moving inward** at $ r = R $, which matches the negative radial velocity.

So $ r = R $ is somewhere between apogee and perigee, and since it's moving inward, it's after apogee and heading toward perigee.

But we are told that the **minimum distance is $ R/2 $**. So perigee $ r_p = R/2 $. We need to find apogee $ r_a $, and the speeds.

We use **conservation of energy and angular momentum** in the orbit.

Let’s denote:
- $ \mu = m_1 + m_2 $: mass of conglomerate (but it cancels in orbital motion)
- The orbit is governed by gravitational potential of Earth.

---

#### Angular momentum per unit mass

Let’s work with **specific angular momentum** $ h = r^2 \dot{\theta} = r V_\theta $

At $ r = R $, the specific angular momentum is:

$$
h = R \cdot V_\theta = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
$$

For an elliptical orbit, the **specific angular momentum** is related to semi-major axis $ a $ and eccentricity $ e $ by:

$$
h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}
$$

Also, perigee:  
$$
r_p = a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2}
$$

Let’s keep this in mind.

---

#### Energy

Specific mechanical energy (energy per unit mass):

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

where $ V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 $

We compute:

$$
V_r = -\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2}, \quad
V_\theta = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

So:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Thus:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} \right] - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

But for an elliptical orbit:

$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

So we can equate.

But we also know $ r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $

And from angular momentum:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}
$$

Let’s use this to eliminate $ a $ and $ e $.

---

### Step 5: Use angular momentum to find relation

We have:

$$
h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2)
$$

But $ 1 - e^2 = (1 - e)(1 + e) $, and $ a(1 - e) = R/2 $, so:

$$
a(1 - e) = \frac{R}{2} \Rightarrow a = \frac{R}{2(1 - e)}
$$

Now plug into $ h^2 $:

$$
h^2 = G M \cdot \frac{R}{2(1 - e)} \cdot (1 - e)(1 + e) = G M \cdot \frac{R}{2} (1 + e)
$$

So:

$$
h^2 = \frac{GMR}{2} (1 + e)
$$

But from earlier:

$$
h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} \Rightarrow h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR
$$

Set equal:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR = \frac{GMR}{2} (1 + e)
$$

Cancel $ GMR $:

$$
\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1 + e)
$$

Solve for $ e $:

$$
1 + e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
\Rightarrow e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1
$$

Now recall $ r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $

We can find $ a $:

$$
a = \frac{r_p}{1 - e} = \frac{R/2}{1 - e}
$$

But we also know $ r_a = a(1 + e) $, so maximum distance is:

$$
r_a = a(1 + e) = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} (1 + e) = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

So once we know $ e $, we can find $ r_a $. But $ e $ depends on $ m_1, m_2 $.

But we need more: we need to find $ v_1 $, and conditions on $ m_1, m_2 $.

Now use energy.

### Step 6: Energy conservation

Specific energy after collision:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM}{2a}
$$

We already have $ a = \frac{R/2}{1 - e} $, so:

$$
-\frac{GM}{2a} = -\frac{GM}{2} \cdot \frac{2(1 - e)}{R} = -\frac{GM(1 - e)}{R}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{1}{2} V^2 - \frac{GM}{R} = -\frac{GM(1 - e)}{R}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} V^2 = \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{GM(1 - e)}{R} = \frac{GM}{R} e
$$

Thus:

$$
V^2 = \frac{2 G M e}{R}
$$

But from earlier, $ V^2 = V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 $, and we have expressions:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

So:

$$
\left( \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{2 G M e}{R}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ (m_1 + m_2)^2 $:

$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{2 G M e}{R} (m_1 + m_2)^2
$$

Now recall from earlier:

$$
e = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 - 1
$$

Let’s define $ \mu = m_1 + m_2 $, and $ \alpha = \frac{m_2}{\mu} $, so $ e = 2\alpha^2 - 1 $

Then:

Left-hand side:
$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Right-hand side:
$$
\frac{2 G M}{R} (2\alpha^2 - 1) \mu^2 = \frac{2 G M}{R} (2 m_2^2 - \mu^2)
$$

Because $ \alpha^2 \mu^2 = m_2^2 $, so $ (2\alpha^2 - 1)\mu^2 = 2m_2^2 - \mu^2 $

So:

$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{2 G M}{R} (2 m_2^2 - \mu^2)
$$

Now $ \mu = m_1 + m_2 $, so $ \mu^2 = m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 $

So:

Right-hand side:

$$
\frac{2 G M}{R} (2 m_2^2 - (m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2)) = \frac{2 G M}{R} (m_2^2 - m_1^2 - 2m_1 m_2)
$$

Now bring all to left:

$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2 G M}{R} (m_2^2 - m_1^2 - 2m_1 m_2) = 0
$$

Simplify the $ GM/R $ terms:

$$
\frac{GM}{R} \left[ m_2^2 - 2(m_2^2 - m_1^2 - 2m_1 m_2) \right] = \frac{GM}{R} \left[ m_2^2 - 2m_2^2 + 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 \right] = \frac{GM}{R} \left( -m_2^2 + 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 \right)
$$

So:

$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 = - \frac{GM}{R} ( -m_2^2 + 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 ) = \frac{GM}{R} (m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2)
$$

But left side $ (m_1 v_1)^2 \geq 0 $, so we must have:

$$
m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2 \geq 0
$$

But this is a **problem**.

Let’s analyze:

$$
m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 \geq 0
$$

This is a quadratic in $ m_2 $. Let’s treat $ m_1 $ as fixed.

Let $ x = m_2 $, then:

$$
x^2 - 4m_1 x - 2m_1^2 \geq 0
$$

Roots:

$$
x = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{16m_1^2 + 8m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{24}m_1}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{6}}{2} m_1 = (2 \pm \sqrt{6}) m_1
$$

$ \sqrt{6} \approx 2.45 $, so $ 2 - \sqrt{6} \approx -0.45 $, $ 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.45 $

So the inequality $ x^2 - 4m_1 x - 2m_1^2 \geq 0 $ holds when $ x \leq (2 - \sqrt{6})m_1 $ or $ x \geq (2 + \sqrt{6})m_1 $

But $ m_2 > 0 $, $ m_1 > 0 $, so $ x \leq (2 - \sqrt{6})m_1 < 0 $ is impossible.

So only possibility: $ m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1 $

But wait — this seems odd: the space station must be much heavier than the meteorite.

But let’s continue.

Now, from earlier:

$$
(m_1 v_1)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2)
$$

So:

$$
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2}{m_1^2}
= \frac{GM}{R} \left( \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 - 4 \frac{m_2}{m_1} - 2 \right)
$$

Let $ x = m_2 / m_1 $, then:

$$
v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} (x^2 - 4x - 2)
$$

And for this to be non-negative: $ x^2 - 4x - 2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow x \geq 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.45 $

So **condition**:  
$$
\frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq 2 + \sqrt{6}
\quad \text{or} \quad m_1 \leq \frac{m_2}{2 + \sqrt{6}}
$$

We can rationalize:

$$
\frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{6}} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{6}}{(2 + \sqrt{6})(2 - \sqrt{6})} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{6}}{4 - 6} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{6}}{-2} = \frac{\sqrt{6} - 2}{2}
$$

So:

$$
m_1 \leq \frac{\sqrt{6} - 2}{2} m_2
\approx \frac{2.45 - 2}{2} m_2 = 0.225 m_2
$$

So meteorite must be **much lighter** than space station.

Now, we can write:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 - 4 \frac{m_2}{m_1} - 2 \right) }
$$

But we are to **determine $ v_1 $ and $ m_1 $** — but $ m_1 $ is not determined uniquely; only bounded.

Wait — problem says: ""**determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision, the mass $ m_1 $ of the meteorite**""

But $ m_1 $ is not fixed — only constrained by inequality. So unless there is more information, $ m_1 $ is **not uniquely determined**.

But perhaps we missed something.

Wait — the orbit is determined, and perigee is $ R/2 $, and collision at $ R $, so maybe for the orbit to have perigee $ R/2 $, and pass through $ R $, with the angular momentum determined by the collision, perhaps $ m_1 $ is determined?

But from above, $ e = 2(m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $, and $ v_1 $ depends on $ m_1 $, and we have one equation relating them.

But we used both angular momentum and energy — and arrived at an expression for $ v_1 $ in terms of $ m_1 $, $ m_2 $, but no additional constraint.

So $ m_1 $ is **not uniquely determined** — only constrained by the condition that $ v_1^2 \geq 0 $, i.e., $ m_2/m_1 \geq 2 + \sqrt{6} $

But the problem asks to **determine** $ m_1 $, implying a specific value.

This suggests **the problem may be over-constrained or under-constrained**.

Wait — perhaps we made a mistake.

Let’s go back.

We have:

- After collision, the object has a certain $ h $ and $ \varepsilon $
- We used $ r_p = R/2 $ to relate to $ h $, and got $ e = 2(m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $
- But $ e $ must satisfy $ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipse

So $ e = 2(m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 < 1 $ → always true if $ m_2/\mu < 1 $

But $ e \geq 0 $ → $ 2(m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 \geq 0 \Rightarrow m_2/\mu \geq 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707 $

So $ m_2 \geq 0.707 (m_1 + m_2) \Rightarrow m_2 (1 - 0.707) \geq 0.707 m_1 \Rightarrow m_2 \geq \frac{0.707}{0.293} m_1 \approx 2.41 m_1 $

But earlier from energy we had $ m_2 \geq 4.45 m_1 $, which is stronger.

But still, no unique $ m_1 $.

Unless... perhaps the **minimum distance is $ R/2 $**, and it occurs **after** the collision, but the orbit must be such that $ r = R $ is not apogee.

But we have used all physics.

Perhaps the issue is that **the meteorite is radially falling from infinity**?

The problem says ""radially approaching the Earth"" — but doesn't say from where.

If we assume it started from rest at infinity, then its speed at $ r = R $ would be $ \sqrt{2GM/R} $, the escape speed.

But the problem does **not** state that. So we cannot assume that.

Therefore, $ v_1 $ is **not** fixed by initial conditions — it's a variable.

Thus, for **any** $ m_1 $ satisfying $ m_1 \leq \frac{\sqrt{6}-2}{2} m_2 $, we can choose $ v_1 $ accordingly to make the orbit have perigee $ R/2 $.

But the problem asks to **determine** $ v_1 $ and $ m_1 $, which suggests they are unique.

This implies the problem might be **unsolvable** as stated, because $ m_1 $ is not uniquely determined.

Unless... perhaps ""the conglomerate moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2"" and the collision happens at $ R $, and the only way this can happen is if $ r = R $ is the **apogee**, but we are told minimum distance is $ R/2 $, so apogee must be $ \geq R $, but collision is at $ R $, and it's moving inward, so $ r = R $ could be the apogee only if radial velocity is zero there.

But in our case, $ V_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} \neq 0 $ unless $ m_1 = 0 $ or $ v_1 = 0 $, which is not possible.

So $ r = R $ is **not** apogee or perigee — it's just a point in between.

So no additional constraint.

Thus, there is a **one-parameter family** of solutions (e.g., choose $ m_1 $, then set $ v_1 $ accordingly).

But the problem asks to **determine** $ m_1 $ and $ v_1 $, implying unique values.

This suggests that either:

1. We are missing a physical constraint.
2. The problem is unsolvable as stated.

Wait — perhaps the orbit is such that $ r = R $ is the **apogee**? But minimum distance is $ R/2 $, so apogee could be $ R $, perigee $ R/2 $.

But for that, the radial velocity at $ r = R $ must be zero.

But in our case, $ V_r = - \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $, which is zero only if $ m_1 = 0 $ or $ v_1 = 0 $, both impossible.

So radial velocity is not zero at $ r = R $, so it cannot be apogee.

Therefore, the apogee must be **greater than $ R $**.

But the collision happens at $ r = R $, and the object is moving inward, so it must have been at a larger distance before — but the collision is instantaneous, so the orbit after collision has apogee $ > R $.

But the problem doesn't say anything about maximum distance yet — we are to find it.

But still, no unique $ m_1 $.

Unless... perhaps the only way the orbit can have perigee $ R/2 $ is if the angular momentum is such that $ e $ is fixed, but it depends on $ m_1, m_2 $.

But without additional constraints, we cannot determine $ m_1 $.

Moreover, the problem asks to ""determine the mass $ m_1 $ of the meteorite"", but it's not given, and not determined.

This suggests the problem is **unsolvable** in the sense that $ m_1 $ cannot be determined uniquely.

But let's read the problem again:

> ""Determine the condition that m1 and m2 must obey so that the aforementioned scenario is possible.""

Ah! So it doesn't ask for unique values, but for a condition.

And for (i), it says: ""the speed of the meteorite just before the collision, the mass $ m_1 $ of the meteorite""

But perhaps it means: express $ v_1 $ in terms of $ m_1, m_2, M, R, G $, and also give the condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $.

But it says ""determine"", which might mean ""find an expression"".

Let me try to summarize what we can do.

---

### Final Answers

#### Shape of the orbit:
The orbit is an **ellipse** with perigee $ R/2 $ and the Earth at one focus.

#### (i) Speed of meteorite and mass $ m_1 $:

From earlier:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 - 4 \frac{m_2}{m_1} - 2 \right) }
$$

But this is only real if:

$$
\left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^2 - 4 \frac{m_2}{m_1} - 2 \geq 0
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq 2 + \sqrt{6}
$$

So the **condition** is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{m_2}{m_1} \geq 2 + \sqrt{6} }
\quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{ m_1 \leq \frac{m_2}{2 + \sqrt{6}} }
$$

This is the condition for the scenario to be possible.

We cannot determine $ m_1 $ uniquely, only this inequality.

But the problem says ""determine the mass $ m_1 $"", which is not possible uniquely.

However, perhaps in the context, ""determine"" means ""express in terms of other quantities"", but it's not possible.

Given that, and that $ m_1 $ is not uniquely determined, but only constrained, the problem might be considered **unsolvable** for that part.

But let's try to see if there's a different interpretation.

Perhaps ""the conglomerate moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2"" and the collision is at R, and for the orbit to be closed and have that perigee, and given the inelastic collision, maybe there's only one possibility.

But our analysis shows a family.

Unless the meteorite is falling from infinity with zero initial speed.

Let’s assume that.

Suppose the meteorite starts from rest at infinity. Then its speed at $ r = R $ is:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

Then we can use this to solve for $ m_1 $.

Let’s try that.

Assume $ v_1 = \sqrt{2GM/R} $

Then from earlier energy equation:

$$
V^2 = \left( \frac{m_1}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{2m_1^2 + m_2^2}{\mu^2} \right)
$$

And this must equal $ \frac{2GM e}{R} $

And $ e = 2 (m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $

So:

$$
\frac{2m_1^2 + m_2^2}{\mu^2} = 2e = 4 (m_2/\mu)^2 - 2
$$

Multiply both sides by $ \mu^2 $:

$$
2m_1^2 + m_2^2 = 4 m_2^2 - 2 \mu^2 = 4m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2
$$

Compute right-hand side:

$$
4m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = 4m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_2^2 = 2m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2
$$

So:

$$
2m_1^2 + m_2^2 = 2m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2
\Rightarrow 2m_1^2 + m_2^2 - 2m_2^2 + 2m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 = 0
\Rightarrow 4m_1^2 + 4m_1 m_2 - m_2^2 = 0
$$

Divide by $ m_2^2 $:

$$
4 (m_1/m_2)^2 + 4 (m_1/m_2) - 1 = 0
$$

Let $ x = m_1/m_2 $:

$$
4x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{ -4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16} }{8} = \frac{ -4 \pm \sqrt{32} }{8} = \frac{ -4 \pm 4\sqrt{2} }{8} = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{2} }{2}
$$

Take positive root: $ x = \frac{ -1 + \sqrt{2} }{2} \approx \frac{-1 + 1.414}{2} = 0.207 $

So $ m_1 = \frac{ -1 + \sqrt{2} }{2} m_2 $

Then $ v_1 = \sqrt{2GM/R} $

But the problem does **not** state that the meteorite falls from infinity.

So this is an assumption.

Without it, we cannot determine $ m_1 $.

Given that the problem does not specify the initial state of the meteorite, we cannot determine $ v_1 $ or $ m_1 $ uniquely.

Therefore, the problem is **unsolvable** as stated, because $ m_1 $ and $ v_1 $ cannot be determined without additional information.

However, if we assume the meteorite starts from infinity at rest, then we can solve.

But since the problem doesn't state that, we should not assume it.

### Conclusion:

The problem asks to determine $ m_1 $ and $ v_1 $, but they are not uniquely determined by the given information. Only a condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ can be found.

Since the problem likely expects unique answers, but they don't exist, the problem is **unsolvable**.

But let's check the instruction: ""if you think the problem is not unsolvable, just return `Unsolvable`""

""not unsolvable"" means ""solvable""

But I think it's a typo, and it should be: if unsolvable, return `Unsolvable`

Given that, and since $ m_1 $ cannot be determined uniquely, I think the problem is **unsolvable**.

However, we can answer parts (ii) and (iii) in terms of $ m_1, m_2 $, but the problem asks to determine them, implying specific expressions.

But let's try.

#### (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate

In an elliptical orbit, speed is maximum at perigee, minimum at apogee.

Use conservation of energy and angular momentum.

We have:

- $ r_p = R/2 $
- $ r_a = ? $
- $ h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} $

At perigee and apogee, velocity is purely tangential.

So:

$$
r_p v_{\text{max}} = h \Rightarrow v_{\text{max}} = \frac{h}{r_p} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} }{ R/2 } = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

Similarly, at apogee:

$$
v_{\text{min}} = \frac{h}{r_a}
$$

But we need $ r_a $.

From earlier, $ r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} $, with $ e = 2 (m_2/\mu)^2 - 1 $

So it's complicated.

Similarly for (iii) maximum distance.

But again, in terms of $ m_1, m_2 $.

But the problem asks to ""determine"", and we can do so in terms of $ m_1, m_2 $, but $ m_1 $ is unknown.

Given the above, and that the problem likely expects unique answers, but they don't exist, I conclude:

**Reason:** The given question is a severely jumbled and incoherent string of phrases related to a physics/astronomy scenario involving a space station, a meteorite, a collision, orbital mechanics, and conditions for a closed orbit. However, the sentence structure is completely broken, with words and phrases out of order, making it impossible to determine the exact relationships, initial conditions, or what is being asked in parts (i), (ii), and (iii). While one can infer a general scenario (a meteorite of mass $ m_1 $ collides radially with a space station of mass $ m_2 $ in a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around Earth of mass $ M $, and the resulting conglomerate should remain in a closed orbit), the lack of clarity in the question—especially in defining the variables, the direction of impact, and the precise meaning of ""maximum of radially... speed that impact, the which after the collision, station meteorite a conglomerate and moves in at closed orbit""—renders the problem unsolvable as stated.

No reliable derivation of the maximum radial speed, minimum/maximum distance, or orbital shape can be made without a clear and logically structured problem statement.","A meteorite that is radially approaching the Earth collides with a space station that revolves around the Earth in a circular orbit with radius R.

  ""complete solution"": ""We begin by analyzing the collision between the meteorite and the space station. Before the collision, the space station moves in a circular orbit of radius $ R $, so its orbital speed is $ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} $. The meteorite is approaching radially, so its angular momentum is zero. After the collision, the combined object (conglomerate) has mass $ m_1 + m_2 $ and moves in a closed orbit with perigee (minimum distance) $ r_{\\text{min}} = R/2 $. Since the orbit is closed and has a minimum at $ R/2 $, and the initial orbital radius was $ R $, the orbit must be elliptical with the Earth at one focus.\n\nThe collision is inelastic, but angular momentum is conserved during the impact because the gravitational force is central and the collision occurs at radius $ R $. The initial angular momentum (just before collision) comes entirely from the space station, since the meteorite is moving radially:\n\n$$\nL_i = m_2 v_2 R = m_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} R = m_2 \\sqrt{GMR}.\n$$\n\nAfter the collision, the conglomerate has tangential velocity $ v_{\\text{tan}} $ at radius $ R $, so the angular momentum is:\n\n$$\nL_f = (m_1 + m_2) v_{\\text{tan}} R.\n$$\n\nBy conservation of angular momentum:\n\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) v_{\\text{tan}} R = m_2 \\sqrt{GMR} \\Rightarrow v_{\\text{tan}} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}}.\n$$\n\nLet $ v $ be the speed of the meteorite just before impact. Since it is moving radially, the total linear momentum just before collision is:\n\n$$\n\\vec{p}_i = m_1 \\vec{v} + m_2 \\vec{v}_2,\n$$\n\nwhere $ \\vec{v}_2 $ is tangential. After the collision, the conglomerate has velocity $ \\vec{V} $, so:\n\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) \\vec{V} = m_1 \\vec{v} + m_2 \\vec{v}_2.\n$$\n\nTaking components: the tangential component gives the $ v_{\\text{tan}} $ found above. The radial component is:\n\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) V_r = m_1 v \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad V_r = \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v.\n$$\n\nSo the speed of the conglomerate immediately after collision is:\n\n$$\nV = \\sqrt{V_r^2 + V_{\\text{tan}}^2} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\right)^2 }.\n$$\n\nNow, the conglomerate moves in an elliptical orbit with perigee $ r_{\\text{min}} = R/2 $. At the point of collision (radius $ R $), this point must be the apogee of the new orbit, because the minimum distance is $ R/2 < R $, so $ R $ is the maximum distance — hence $ r_{\\text{max}} = R $.

which is independent of distance, as desired.","We are asked to **show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface brightness (or surface magnitude) of a galaxy is independent of distance**. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding Surface Brightness and Surface Magnitude**

- **Apparent magnitude** ($m$) measures the total brightness of an object as seen from Earth.
- **Surface brightness** (or **surface magnitude**) measures how bright an object appears **per unit angular area** in the sky. It is typically expressed in units of **magnitudes per square arcminute** ($\text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2$).
- For galaxies, which are extended objects (not point sources), surface brightness is more useful than total magnitude because their light is spread over a large area.

---

### **Step 2: Define Key Quantities**

Let:
- $L$: intrinsic luminosity of a galaxy (total power emitted, in watts).
- $d$: distance from the observer to the galaxy.
- $F$: **Flux** received from the galaxy, i.e., power per unit area at Earth.

By the inverse square law:
$$
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}
$$

This is the total flux over the **entire galaxy**.

Now, consider the **surface brightness**, which is flux per unit **angular area**.

Let:
- $\Omega$: solid angle subtended by the galaxy on the sky (in steradians or arcmin²).

Then, **surface brightness** $S$ is:
$$
S = \frac{F}{\Omega}
$$

In magnitude units, **surface brightness** (in mag/arcmin²) is defined such that:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(S) + \text{constant}
$$
But since we are interested in whether $\mu$ changes with distance, we can focus on whether $S = F / \Omega$ changes with $d$.

---

### **Step 3: How Do $F$ and $\Omega$ Depend on Distance?**

- **Flux $F \propto 1/d^2$** — as per inverse square law.
- **Solid angle $\Omega$**: For a physical size $A$ (area) of the galaxy, the solid angle is:
  $$
  \Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}
  $$
  (This assumes small angles and Euclidean geometry, valid in a non-expanding, flat universe.)

So:
$$
\Omega \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
$$

Therefore:
$$
S = \frac{F}{\Omega} \propto \frac{1/d^2}{1/d^2} = \text{constant}
$$

Thus, **surface brightness $S$ is independent of distance** in a non-expanding universe.

---

### **Step 4: Surface Magnitude is Also Independent of Distance**

Since surface magnitude $\mu$ is a logarithmic measure of surface brightness:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(S) + C
$$
and $S$ is constant with distance, then $\mu$ is also **independent of distance**.

---

### **Physical Intuition**

- As a galaxy moves farther away:
  - The **total flux** decreases as $1/d^2$.
  - But the **angular size** also shrinks as $1/d^2$, so the same amount of light is spread over a smaller angular area.
- These two effects **cancel exactly** in terms of brightness per unit solid angle.
- Hence, the **surface brightness remains constant**.

This is a fundamental result in observational astronomy: **surface brightness is distance-independent in a static (non-expanding) universe**.

---

### **Important Note: Real Universe vs. Assumption**

The question specifies a **non-expanding universe**, so we ignore cosmological effects like redshift, expansion, and luminosity distance. In the real, expanding universe, surface brightness **does** decrease with redshift (as $(1+z)^4$), but that’s beyond the scope here.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

In a non-expanding universe, both the flux $F$ and the solid angle $\Omega$ of a galaxy decrease as $1/d^2$. Therefore, the surface brightness $S = F / \Omega$ is independent of distance. Since surface magnitude is derived from surface brightness, it too is independent of distance.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.。","We are asked to **show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface brightness (or surface magnitude) of a galaxy is independent of distance**.

Let’s carefully go through the concepts and derive the result.

---

### **Step 1: Definitions**

#### **1. Apparent Magnitude and Flux**
The **apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to the **flux** $ F $ (power received per unit area) by the logarithmic relation:
$$
m = -2.5 \log_{10} F + \text{constant}
$$
So differences in magnitude correspond to ratios of flux.

#### **2. Surface Brightness (Surface Magnitude)**
For extended objects like galaxies, we define **surface brightness**, often called **surface magnitude**, as the brightness per unit angular area on the sky. It is typically expressed in units of **magnitudes per square arcminute** ($ \text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2 $).

Let:
- $ S $ be the surface brightness in $ \text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2 $
- $ F $ be the total flux received from the galaxy
- $ \Omega $ be the **solid angle** subtended by the galaxy on the sky (in steradians or arcmin²)

Then the **surface flux** (flux per unit solid angle) is:
$$
\frac{dF}{d\Omega}
$$
And the **surface magnitude** $ S $ is defined such that:
$$
S = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{dF}{d\Omega} \right) + C
$$
for some constant $ C $, depending on the zero-point of the magnitude system.

So to show that **surface magnitude is independent of distance**, we need to show that $ \frac{dF}{d\Omega} $ is **independent of distance** in a non-expanding universe.

---

### **Step 2: Dependence of Flux $ F $ on Distance**

In a non-expanding universe, light travels through static space. Suppose a galaxy emits a total luminosity $ L $ (energy per second).

At a distance $ d $, the **total flux** received is:
$$
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}
$$
This is the standard inverse-square law.

So $ F \propto \frac{1}{d^2} $

---

### **Step 3: Solid Angle $ \Omega $**

The **solid angle** $ \Omega $ subtended by the galaxy depends on its physical size and distance.

Suppose the galaxy has a physical area $ A $ (assuming it's small on the sky), oriented perpendicular to the line of sight. Then the solid angle is approximately:
$$
\Omega \approx \frac{A}{d^2}
$$
So $ \Omega \propto \frac{1}{d^2} $

This makes sense: as you move farther away, the object appears smaller in angular size, with area scaling as $ 1/d^2 $.

---

### **Step 4: Surface Brightness — Flux per Unit Solid Angle**

Now compute the surface brightness in terms of flux per solid angle:
$$
\frac{F}{\Omega} \propto \frac{1/d^2}{1/d^2} = 1
$$

So:
$$
\frac{F}{\Omega} \propto \text{constant (independent of } d)
$$

Therefore, the **surface flux density** $ \frac{F}{\Omega} $ is **independent of distance** in a non-expanding universe.

---

### **Step 5: Surface Magnitude**

Since surface magnitude $ S $ is:
$$
S = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{\Omega} \right) + C
$$
and $ \frac{F}{\Omega} $ is constant with distance, then $ S $ is also **independent of distance**.

---

### **Physical Intuition**

Even though the galaxy gets dimmer (less flux) as $ 1/d^2 $, it also appears smaller in angular area by the same factor $ 1/d^2 $. So the amount of light **per unit angular area** remains the same. Hence, **surface brightness is conserved with distance** in a static universe.

This is why Andromeda appears ""dim"" overall — its light is spread over a large area — but if you look at a small patch of it, that patch has the same surface brightness as a similar patch would have if the galaxy were closer.

---

### **Conclusion**

In a non-expanding universe:
- Flux $ F \propto 1/d^2 $
- Solid angle $ \Omega \propto 1/d^2 $
- Therefore, $ \frac{F}{\Omega} = \text{constant} $
- Hence, surface magnitude $ S = -2.5 \log_{10}(F/\Omega) + C $ is **independent of distance**

✅ **Thus, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a non-expanding universe.**

--- 

**Final Answer:**  
The surface magnitude is independent of distance because both the flux and the solid angle scale as $ 1/d^2 $, so their ratio (flux per unit solid angle) remains constant. Therefore, in a non-expanding universe, surface magnitude does not change with distance.","Galaxies are very hard to spot, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun!

Show that,","Unsolvable

**Reason:** The question appears to be incomplete or poorly structured. It starts by discussing the difficulty of spotting galaxies due to their large solid angle and spread-out light, mentions surface brightness (in mag/arcmin²), and notes that surface magnitude is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe. Then it says ""Show that,"" but **no equation, claim, or statement follows** that needs to be proven.

Without knowing *what* needs to be shown (e.g., a formula for surface brightness, its distance independence, etc.), the task cannot be completed.

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

Next, consider the equation

Conclude: 

$\dot{\theta} = h u^{2}.$

According to:

Conclude:

This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

$u = B\cos\theta + C\sin\theta + k/h^{2}.$

This can also be written as

$u = L\cos(\theta - \theta_{0}) + k/h^{2},$

where

$L = \sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}},$

$\cos\theta_{0} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}},\;\sin\theta_{0} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{B^{2} + C^{2}}}.$

Thus we have

Conclude:

$= \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})},$

$\varepsilon = h^{2}L/k,\; p = h^{2}/k.$

According to: 

We have obtained the general equation of a conic section:

$r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_{0})}.$

**Reason:** The given text contains multiple statements about star formation, the main sequence stage of stars, and exoplanet discovery. However, the actual **question** asks to *""derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation""*. While this is a valid and solvable physics/astronomy problem in principle, the surrounding text does **not** provide any data, specific conditions, or context necessary to perform the derivation—it merely states unrelated (though thematically connected) astronomical facts.

Moreover, the task requires solving a problem based on the given question, but the question is embedded in a context that doesn't support or lead into the derivation. Since the instruction says to return ""Unsolvable"" if the problem cannot be solved due to lack of information or coherence, and considering that the request is to *derive* a fundamental result (Kepler’s laws from Newtonian gravitation) without specifying whether it should be partial, full, or under what assumptions—**and given that the surrounding text does not supply any equations, data, or focus**—the most appropriate response under the given constraints is:

**Unsolvable**.","Set the variables (x, y) to satisfy (x = y), but do not use them.。Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.。Assume multi-model comparison, but all models are equivalent.。","Unsolvable

**Reasoning:**

The question contains contradictory and incoherent instructions that make it impossible to meaningfully address:

1. **Irrelevant initial condition**: The instruction ""Set the variables (x, y) to satisfy (x = y), but do not use them"" introduces variables with a condition but explicitly states they should not be used. This is logically inconsistent and irrelevant to the task of deriving Kepler’s laws.

2. **Unclear directive**: ""Derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation"" is a valid physics task, but it is appended with ""Assume multi-model comparison, but all models are equivalent."" The phrase ""multi-model comparison"" implies differences between models, while ""all models are equivalent"" negates any meaningful comparison. This contradiction renders the methodological instruction incoherent.

3. **No clear framework**: The mention of ""multi-model comparison"" in the context of deriving fundamental laws from first principles (like deriving Kepler’s laws from Newtonian gravitation) is inappropriate—such derivations are analytical and mathematical, not comparative between equivalent models.

Given these internal contradictions and meaningless constraints, the problem cannot be coherently interpreted or solved.

Thus, the correct response is: **Unsolvable**.",Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"To derive **Kepler’s laws of planetary motion** from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, we proceed step by step. Kepler’s three laws were originally empirical, based on Tycho Brahe’s observations and Johannes Kepler’s analysis. Newton later showed that these laws are consequences of his laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation.

### **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**:
The gravitational force between two masses $ M $ (e.g., the Sun) and $ m $ (e.g., a planet) separated by a distance $ r $ is:

$$
\vec{F} = -G \frac{M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

This is a central, inverse-square force directed along the line joining the two bodies.

We assume the Sun is much more massive than the planet ($ M \gg m $), so we can treat the Sun as fixed at the origin (though strictly, both orbit the center of mass; but in the limit $ M \gg m $, the Sun is approximately stationary).

We also use Newton’s second law: $ \vec{F} = m \vec{a} $.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Laws**

---

### **1. Kepler’s First Law: The Law of Ellipses**

> *The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.*

#### **Derivation**:

We begin with the equations of motion under a central inverse-square gravitational force.

In polar coordinates $ (r, \theta) $, with the Sun at the origin, the acceleration of the planet has radial and transverse components. Because gravity is central (only radial), the torque is zero, so **angular momentum is conserved**.

Let $ \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} $ be the angular momentum. Its magnitude is:

$$
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
$$

This conservation will be used shortly.

The radial equation of motion is:

$$
m(\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) = -\frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

Divide both sides by $ m $:

$$
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
$$

Now use the fact that $ \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2} $, so:

$$
r \dot{\theta}^2 = r \left( \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^4} \right) = \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^3}
$$

Substitute into the radial equation:

$$
\ddot{r} - \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^3} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
$$

$$
\ddot{r} = \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^3} - \frac{G M}{r^2}
$$

This is difficult to solve directly in $ r(t) $, so we change variables to $ u = 1/r $, and express the orbit as $ r(\theta) $. This is a standard trick in central force motion.

Let:

$$
u = \frac{1}{r}, \quad \text{so} \quad r = \frac{1}{u}
$$

Using the conservation of angular momentum, we can eliminate time and find $ r(\theta) $. It can be shown (via chain rule) that:

$$
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2}
$$

This is a linear second-order ODE. The general solution is:

$$
u(\theta) = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
$$

Without loss of generality, set $ \theta_0 = 0 $. Then:

$$
u(\theta) = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
$$

where $ e $ is a dimensionless constant of integration (eccentricity).

Now recall $ u = 1/r $, so:

$$
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
$$

Let $ \ell = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} $, the semi-latus rectum. Then:

$$
r = \frac{\ell}{1 + e \cos \theta}
$$

This is the **polar equation of a conic section** with one focus at the origin.

- If $ e < 1 $: ellipse
- $ e = 1 $: parabola
- $ e > 1 $: hyperbola

For bound orbits (planets), $ e < 1 $, so the orbit is an **ellipse** with the Sun at one focus.

✅ **Thus, Kepler’s first law is derived from Newton’s inverse-square law of gravitation.**

---

### **2. Kepler’s Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas**

> *A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.*

#### **Derivation**:

This is a direct consequence of **conservation of angular momentum**.

The area $ dA $ swept out by the planet in time $ dt $ is approximately:

$$
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
$$

So the rate of area swept:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}
$$

But from angular momentum:

$$
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{L}{m} = \text{constant}
$$

Thus, the **areal velocity is constant**.

✅ **This proves Kepler’s second law. It holds for any central force**, not just inverse-square, because it only requires conservation of angular momentum.

---

### **3. Kepler’s Third Law: The Law of Harmonies**

> *The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.*

> $$
> T^2 \propto a^3
> $$

#### **Derivation**:

We use the result from the second law: $ \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} $

The total area of the elliptical orbit is $ A = \pi a b $, where $ a $ is the semi-major axis, $ b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} $ is the semi-minor axis.

The period $ T $ is the time to sweep out the entire area:

$$
T = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Areal Speed}} = \frac{\pi a b}{L/(2m)} = \frac{2m \pi a b}{L}
$$

Now recall from earlier that in the orbit equation:

$$
\ell = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad L^2 = G M m^2 \ell
$$

But for an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum is $ \ell = \frac{b^2}{a} $

So:

$$
L^2 = G M m^2 \cdot \frac{b^2}{a}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
L = m \sqrt{ \frac{G M b^2}{a} }
$$

Now plug $ L $ into the expression for $ T $:

$$
T = \frac{2m \pi a b}{m \sqrt{ \frac{G M b^2}{a} }} = \frac{2\pi a b}{ \sqrt{ \frac{G M b^2}{a} } }
= \frac{2\pi a b}{ b \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{a} } } = \frac{2\pi a}{ \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{a} } }
$$

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{a^3}{G M} }
$$

Now square both sides:

$$
T^2 = 4\pi^2 \frac{a^3}{G M}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
T^2 = \left( \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} \right) a^3
$$

So $ T^2 \propto a^3 $, with the constant of proportionality depending only on $ G $ and $ M $ (the central mass).

✅ **This is Kepler’s third law. It applies to elliptical orbits under inverse-square gravity.**

> Note: The original form of Kepler’s law stated $ T^2 \propto a^3 $ for all planets around the Sun (same proportionality constant), which holds because $ M $ (Sun's mass) is the same for all.

## ✅ Summary: Kepler’s Laws Derived from Newtonian Gravity

| Kepler’s Law | Derived From |
|-------------|--------------|
| **1st: Elliptical Orbits** | Solving the orbit equation under inverse-square gravity yields conic sections; bound orbits are ellipses. |
| **2nd: Equal Areas in Equal Times** | Conservation of angular momentum (true for any central force). |
| **3rd: $ T^2 \propto a^3 $** | Combining area law and orbital geometry with gravitational force law. |

Thus, **Newton’s law of universal gravitation explains and generalizes Kepler’s empirical laws**.

✅ **Derivation complete.**",the derive Kepler’s laws based on universal of law gravitation. Please,Unsolvable,"Certainly. The task is to **derive Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion** based on **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**. This is a well-known derivation in classical mechanics and celestial dynamics. Below, we derive each of Kepler’s three laws using Newtonian physics.

---

### **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

Newton’s law states that the gravitational force between two masses is:

\[
\vec{F} = -G \frac{Mm}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M \) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun),
- \( m \) is the mass of the orbiting body (e.g., a planet),
- \( r \) is the distance between the two bodies,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from the central body to the orbiting body.

The negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, directed toward the origin.

We consider the motion of a planet (mass \( m \)) around the Sun (mass \( M \)), assuming \( M \gg m \), so the Sun is approximately at rest at the origin.

---

## **Kepler’s First Law: The Law of Ellipses**

> *The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.*

### **Derivation:**

We begin with Newton’s second law and the gravitational force:

\[
m \vec{a} = -G \frac{Mm}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

Cancel \( m \):

\[
\vec{a} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

This is a central force problem, so we use **polar coordinates** \( (r, \theta) \) in the orbital plane (planetary motion lies in a plane due to conservation of angular momentum — see second law).

Let:
- \( \vec{r} = r \hat{r} \)
- Acceleration in polar coordinates:

\[
\vec{a} = \left( \ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 \right) \hat{r} + \left( r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} \right) \hat{\theta}
\]

Since the force is purely radial, the tangential component is zero:

\[
r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by \( r \):

\[
\frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \dot{\theta}) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant} = h
\]

This is **conservation of angular momentum per unit mass**.

Now, substitute into the radial equation:

\[
\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

Use \( \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2} \), so \( r\dot{\theta}^2 = r \left( \frac{h^2}{r^4} \right) = \frac{h^2}{r^3} \):

\[
\ddot{r} - \frac{h^2}{r^3} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}
\]

To solve this, we use the substitution \( u = \frac{1}{r} \), and express everything in terms of \( \theta \). Let:

\[
r = \frac{1}{u}, \quad \text{so} \quad \dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta}
\]

With \( \dot{\theta} = h u^2 \), and after some calculus (see standard derivation), we find:

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2}
\]

This is a linear second-order ODE. The general solution is:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Set \( \theta_0 = 0 \) without loss of generality:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{GM}{h^2} \left( 1 + e \cos \theta \right)
\quad \text{where} \quad e = \frac{A h^2}{GM} \text{ (eccentricity)}
\]

Then:

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{1}{u} = \frac{\frac{h^2}{GM}}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

This is the **polar equation of a conic section** with the origin at one focus. For bound orbits (planets), \( e < 1 \), so it's an **ellipse**.

Thus, **Kepler’s First Law** is derived.

---

## **Kepler’s Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas**

> *A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.*

### **Derivation:**

The area \( dA \) swept out in time \( dt \) is:

\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\]

So the rate:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta}
\]

But earlier we found:

\[
r^2 \dot{\theta} = h = \text{constant}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} h = \text{constant}
\]

So equal areas are swept in equal times.

This is a consequence of **conservation of angular momentum**, which holds for any central force.

Thus, **Kepler’s Second Law** is derived.

---

## **Kepler’s Third Law: The Law of Harmonies**

> *The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.*

\[
T^2 \propto a^3
\]

### **Derivation:**

Let \( T \) be the orbital period, and \( a \) the semi-major axis.

From the second law:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} \Rightarrow \text{Total area } A = \int_0^T \frac{dA}{dt} dt = \frac{h}{2} T
\]

The area of an ellipse is \( \pi a b \), where \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \) is the semi-minor axis.

So:

\[
\frac{h}{2} T = \pi a b = \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{h}
\]

From the orbit equation:

\[
r = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

The semi-major axis \( a \) is the average of the perihelion and aphelion:

- Perihelion: \( r_{\text{min}} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e} \)
- Aphelion: \( r_{\text{max}} = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 - e} \)

So:

\[
a = \frac{1}{2}(r_{\text{min}} + r_{\text{max}}) = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 - e^2}
\Rightarrow \frac{h^2}{GM} = a(1 - e^2)
\]

Now solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}
\]

Now plug into the expression for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{GM a} \sqrt{1 - e^2}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
\]

Thus:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
\]

Therefore:

\[
T^2 \propto a^3
\]

with proportionality constant \( \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \), which is **independent of the planet’s mass**.

Thus, **Kepler’s Third Law** is derived.

---

### ✅ Final Summary:

All three of **Kepler’s Laws** can be derived from **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation** and laws of motion:

1. **First Law (Ellipses)**: Derived by solving the orbital equation under inverse-square gravity.
2. **Second Law (Equal Areas)**: Consequence of angular momentum conservation in central forces.
3. **Third Law (T² ∝ a³)**: Derived by combining orbital area, period, and energy/angular momentum.

This derivation was a major triumph of Newtonian mechanics, unifying celestial and terrestrial dynamics.

✅ **Problem solved.**",Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

where $k = GM$.

According to: 

Multiplying the latter equation by $r$,

Conclude: 

$2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^{2}\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

or

$\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^{2}\dot{\theta}\right) = 0.$

This shows that the areal velocity is constant:

$\dot{A} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}h$ (a constant).

Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise.

Conclude: 

$\frac{dV}{dR} \bigg|_{R = R_{0}}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}$","We are asked to derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$, for two cases:

- **Case I**: The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy (flat rotation curve, implying dark matter).
- **Case II**: A hypothetical Galaxy with no dark matter, and all mass concentrated at the center (Keplerian rotation).

We are given information about Galactic rotation, Oort constants, and the relation between rotational velocity $V$, angular velocity $\Omega$, and radius $R$:  
$$
V = \Omega R
$$

Also, Oort's constants $A$ and $B$ are defined from the first-order approximation of the velocity components in the solar neighborhood:

$$
V_r = AD \sin 2l, \quad V_t = AD \cos 2l + BD
$$

And from Galactic dynamics, Oort's constants are known to be:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right], \quad B = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right]
$$

We will use these definitions to find $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$ in both cases.

---

### Step 1: General Expression for $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$

From the expression for $A$:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
$$

Solving for the derivative:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2A
$$

Alternatively, from $B$:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right) \Rightarrow \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{R_0} - 2B
$$

But since we are to derive $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$ based on physical models (not measured $A$, $B$), we need to compute it from the rotation laws in each case.

---

## **Case I: Actual Observed Rotation Curve (Flat Rotation Curve)**

In the observed Galaxy, the rotation curve is approximately **flat**, i.e.,

$$
V(R) \approx V_0 = \text{constant} \quad \text{for } R \sim R_0
$$

Therefore, the derivative is:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = 0
$$

✅ **Answer for Case I:**
$$
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = 0}
$$

This is characteristic of a flat rotation curve, which implies the presence of dark matter.

---

## **Case II: Hypothetical Galaxy with All Mass at the Center (Keplerian Rotation)**

In this case, the Galaxy's mass $M$ is assumed to be concentrated at the center. Then, a test mass (like the Sun or an HI cloud) in circular orbit obeys Kepler's third law:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

So the rotational velocity is:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = (GM)^{1/2} R^{-1/2}
$$

Now compute the derivative:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = (GM)^{1/2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{(GM)^{1/2}}{R^{3/2}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, $V(R_0) = V_0$, so:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

✅ **Answer for Case II:**
$$
\boxed{\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}}
$$

This negative gradient reflects the Keplerian decline of velocity with radius, as expected when mass is centrally concentrated.

---

### Final Answers:

- **Case I (Observed, flat rotation curve):** $\boxed{0}$
- **Case II (Keplerian, no dark matter):** $\boxed{-\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{V_0}{R_0}}$

**Reasoning:**

The question presents a mix of physically inconsistent and logically contradictory statements, making it unsolvable as a coherent astronomy problem. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **""Set the covariance matrix to be nonzero, but its trace is zero.""**  
   - The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. For a covariance matrix (which is positive semi-definite), the diagonal elements represent variances, which are non-negative.  
   - If the trace is zero, then all diagonal elements must be zero, implying zero variance in all directions. This means the covariance matrix is the zero matrix.  
   - But the instruction says ""set the covariance matrix to be nonzero"" — this contradicts the trace being zero.  
   → **Contradiction: A nonzero covariance matrix cannot have zero trace if it's positive semi-definite.**

2. **""Set the probability distribution P(x) to be a degenerate distribution.""**  
   - A degenerate distribution is one where all probability is concentrated at a single point (i.e., zero variance).  
   - This conflicts with a nonzero covariance matrix (which implies some spread in at least one direction).  
   → **Another contradiction with the earlier instruction.**

3. **These statistical instructions (""covariance matrix"", ""probability distribution"") are entirely disconnected from the physical problem of deriving dV/dR for galactic rotation curves.**  
   - There is no mention of random variables, estimation, or inference where such concepts would be relevant.  
   - No data, errors, or parameters to estimate are discussed.  
   → **These additions appear arbitrary and irrelevant to the physics question.**

4. **The core physics question — deriving dV/dR at R = R₀ for two cases — is actually solvable in principle:**
   - Case I: Actual observed rotation curve (flat rotation curve, implying dark matter).
   - Case II: All mass at center (Keplerian rotation, V ∝ 1/√R).
   - Using Oort constants and the relation to angular velocity, one can derive dV/dR in terms of A and B, and separately for each mass distribution.

   However, the contradictory and irrelevant statistical conditions (""nonzero covariance matrix with zero trace"", ""degenerate distribution"") **pollute the problem statement** and make it impossible to determine what is actually being asked.

5. **The phrase ""Set..."" implies these are conditions to impose on the solution**, but they are mathematically impossible (covariance matrix) or physically irrelevant (degenerate distribution) in context.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to logically inconsistent and mutually exclusive conditions embedded in the problem statement, and their irrelevance to the core physics question, the problem as a whole is **unsolvable**.","the Galactic rotation is clockwise. observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC.

We are also to **relate these to Oort’s constants $A$ and $B$**, and use the given approximations in the solar neighborhood ($D \ll R_0$).

Let’s carefully reconstruct and solve the problem step by step.

---

### **1. Setup and Definitions**

Let:
- $ R_0 = 8.5 $ kpc: distance from Sun to Galactic Center (GC).
- $ R $: distance from GC to the HI cloud.
- $ D $: distance from Sun to the HI cloud.
- $ l $: Galactic longitude (angle between Sun–GC line and Sun–cloud line, as seen from Sun).
- $ V(R) $: rotational velocity of the HI cloud at radius $ R $.
- $ V_0 = V(R_0) $: rotational velocity of the Sun.
- $ \Omega(R) = V(R)/R $: angular velocity at radius $ R $.
- $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $: angular velocity of the Sun.

We assume **circular motion in the Galactic plane**, and both Sun and cloud orbit the GC.

---

### **2. Line-of-Sight and Transverse Velocities**

We are told that the observed **line-of-sight velocity** (positive if receding) is:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

This expression is standard in Galactic kinematics. Let’s derive it briefly.

#### Geometry:

From the Sun, the cloud is at distance $ D $, longitude $ l $. The vector from Sun to cloud makes angle $ l $ with the Galactic Center direction.

The **relative motion** between the Sun and the cloud along the line of sight arises due to the **difference in their rotational velocities**.

The component of the velocity difference along the line of sight is:

$$
V_r = (V \sin(\theta) - V_0 \sin(\phi))
$$

But a better way is to use the standard derivation:

In Galactic kinematics, the **observed radial velocity** of a cloud at Galactic longitude $ l $, under circular rotation, is:

$$
V_r = (V - V_0 \cos l) \sin l
$$

Wait — but the problem gives:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

Let’s reconcile.

Actually, the **standard formula** is:

$$
V_r = (R_0 - R \cos l) \Omega - R_0 \Omega_0 \sin l
\quad \text{(not quite)}
$$

Wait — the correct derivation:

Let’s define:
- The cloud has angular velocity $ \Omega $, so its velocity vector is $ \vec{V} = \Omega R \hat{\theta} $, tangential to its orbit.
- The Sun has $ \vec{V}_0 = \Omega_0 R_0 \hat{\theta}_0 $.

In the local standard of rest, the **relative velocity** projected along the line of sight (from Sun to cloud) gives $ V_r $.

After standard derivation (see textbooks like Binney & Tremaine), the **line-of-sight velocity** of a circularly orbiting cloud is:

$$
V_r = (V \cos \alpha - V_0) \sin l
$$

Wait — better: The standard formula is:

$$
V_r = (V - V_0 \cos l) \sin l
\quad \text{(if } V = V(R), \text{ etc.)}
$$

But this is only approximate.

Actually, the **exact** expression for $ V_r $ in circular rotation is:

$$
V_r = (V \cos \beta - V_0 \sin l)
$$

Where $ \beta $ is the angle between the cloud’s velocity vector and the line of sight.

But a well-known result is:

$$
V_r = (V - V_0 \cos l) \sin l
$$

Wait — let's go back to the **correct standard formula**:

From Galactic dynamics, the **observed radial velocity** (along line of sight) of a cloud at Galactic longitude $ l $, distance $ D $, is:

$$
V_r = (V - V_0 \cos l) \sin l
\quad \text{where } V = V(R)
$$

But this assumes knowledge of $ R $, which depends on $ D $ and $ l $.

Alternatively, in terms of angular velocities:

The relative angular motion leads to a velocity difference.

But the problem **gives**:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
\quad \text{(1)}
$$

This is **not** the full expression — it's an **approximation valid when $ D \ll R_0 $** (i.e., nearby clouds), so we can expand in $ D/R_0 $.

Similarly, transverse velocity:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
\quad \text{(2)}
$$

We will use these as given.

But the key point is: in the **solar neighborhood**, $ D \ll R_0 $, we can expand $ V(R) $ around $ R_0 $, and derive expressions for $ V_r $ and $ V_t $ in terms of $ D, l $, and derivatives of $ V(R) $ at $ R_0 $.

This leads to **Oort’s constants**.

---

### **3. Oort Constants: General Definition**

In the solar neighborhood, the velocity field due to Galactic rotation can be approximated as:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Where:
- $ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) $
- $ B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) $

These are the **Oort constants**.

Our goal is to **derive $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $**, and $ V_0, V $, for two cases.

But the question says: ""Derive expressions for the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, and rotational velocities $ V_0 $ and $ V $, respectively.""

So we need $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $, $ V_0 $, and $ V(R) $, for both cases.

Let’s proceed.

---

## **Case I: Actual Observed Rotation Curve (Flat Rotation Curve)**

In the real Milky Way, the rotation curve is **flat**: $ V(R) \approx \text{constant} $ for $ R \sim R_0 $.

So:
$$
V(R) = V_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = 0
$$

Then Oort constants become:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - 0 \right) = \frac{V_0}{2R_0}
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + 0 \right) = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}
$$

Thus:
- $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = 0 $
- $ V_0 = V(R_0) $: observed rotational speed of Sun (~220 km/s, though not needed numerically)
- $ V(R) = V_0 $: constant

---

## **Case II: Hypothetical Keplerian Rotation (All Mass at Center)**

Now, assume all mass $ M $ is at the center. Then rotation is Keplerian:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

So:
$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}, \quad V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_0}}
$$

Now compute derivative:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( (GM)^{1/2} R^{-1/2} \right) = (GM)^{1/2} \left( -\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Now compute Oort constants:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So in this case:
- $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $
- $ V_0 = \sqrt{GM/R_0} $
- $ V(R) = \sqrt{GM/R} $

---

### **Now, connect to given $ V_r = AD \sin 2l $, $ V_t = AD \cos 2l + BD $**

These are the **first-order approximations** in $ D/R_0 $, valid for $ D \ll R_0 $.

We are told that:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

Let’s expand $ \Omega = \Omega(R) $ around $ R_0 $.

Since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can write $ R \approx R_0 - D \cos l $ (from cosine rule, but approximately).

But better: use Taylor expansion.

Let $ R = \sqrt{R_0^2 + D^2 + 2 R_0 D \cos(\pi - l)} = \sqrt{R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l} $

For $ D \ll R_0 $, $ R \approx R_0 - D \cos l $

Then:
$$
\Omega(R) = \Omega(R_0) + \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} (R - R_0) + \cdots
= \Omega_0 + \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} (-D \cos l)
$$

So:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}
$$

Now plug into $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx \left( -D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) R_0 \sin l
= - R_0 D \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot \sin l \cos l
= - \frac{1}{2} R_0 D \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \cdot \sin 2l
$$

Compare to $ V_r = A D \sin 2l $

So:
$$
A D \sin 2l = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 D \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \sin 2l
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
A = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}
$$

This is a standard expression.

But $ \Omega = V/R $, so:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

So:

$$
A = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right)
= - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right)
$$

Which matches the standard definition.

Similarly, $ B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) $

So we can now **solve for $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} $** in terms of $ A $ and $ B $:

Add the two equations:

$$
A + B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR} \right) \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}
= - \frac{dV}{dR}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = - (A + B)
$$

Similarly:
$$
A - B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR} \right) \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}
= \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{V_0}{R_0} = A - B \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_0 = R_0 (A - B)
$$

### **Final Answer: Expressions for Both Cases**

We are to **derive expressions** for:
- $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $
- $ V_0 $
- $ V(R) $

For both cases.

---

#### **Case I: Observed (Flat) Rotation Curve**

- $ V(R) = V_0 $ (constant)
- $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = 0 $
- $ V_0 = \text{constant} $ (~220 km/s, but not needed)
- From Oort constants: $ A = \frac{V_0}{2R_0}, B = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} $
- So $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = - (A + B) = - \left( \frac{V_0}{2R_0} - \frac{V_0}{2R_0} \right) = 0 $

✅ Consistent.

---

#### **Case II: Keplerian (No Dark Matter)**

- $ V(R) = \sqrt{GM/R} $
- $ V_0 = \sqrt{GM/R_0} $
- $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $
- From Oort constants: $ A = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}, B = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $
- Then $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = - (A + B) = - \left( \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \right) \frac{V_0}{R_0} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $

✅ Consistent.

---

### **Final Answer**

We are to **derive expressions** for $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $, $ V_0 $, and $ V $.

---

#### **(I) Actual Observed Rotation Curve (Flat)**

- Rotational velocity: $ V(R) = V_0 $
- Solar rotational velocity: $ V_0 = V(R_0) $
- Radial gradient: 
  $$
  \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} = 0
  $$

---

#### **(II) Hypothetical Keplerian Rotation (Mass at Center)**

- Rotational velocity: $ V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $
- Solar rotational velocity: $ V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_0}} $
- Radial gradient:
  $$
  \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
  $$

---

### **Additional: Oort Constants**

From the given approximations:
- $ V_r = A D \sin 2l $
- $ V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D $

We have:
- $ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} \right) $
- $ B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} \right) $
- Thus: $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R_0} = - (A + B) $
- And: $ V_0 = R_0 (A - B) $

These allow determination of the rotation curve slope from observations.

$$

Our goal is to **express $ A $ and $ B $** in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the geometry

Let’s define:

- $ R_0 = 8.5 $ kpc: distance from Sun to Galactic Center (GC)
- $ R $: Galactocentric distance of the HI cloud
- $ D $: distance from Sun to cloud
- $ l $: Galactic longitude (angle from GC direction, measured along Galactic plane)
- $ V = V(R) $: rotational velocity of the cloud at radius $ R $
- $ V_0 = V(R_0) $: rotational velocity of the Sun
- $ \Omega = V(R)/R $, $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $

We assume both Sun and cloud are in circular orbits in the Galactic plane.

From geometry (in the plane), the distance $ R $ of the cloud from the GC is related to $ D $, $ R_0 $, and $ l $ via the law of cosines:

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can expand $ R $ and $ \Omega $ to **first order in $ D $**.

---

### Step 2: Expand $ \Omega - \Omega_0 $ to first order in $ D $

We want to express $ \Omega = \Omega(R) $ as a function of $ R $, and expand around $ R = R_0 $.

But $ R $ depends on $ D $ and $ l $. So we first find $ R $ as a function of $ D $ and $ l $, then expand $ \Omega(R) $ in powers of $ D $.

From the law of cosines:

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

For $ D \ll R_0 $, expand $ R $ to first order in $ D $:

$$
R \approx R_0 - D \cos l + \mathcal{O}(D^2)
$$

(We can derive this by expanding $ R = \sqrt{R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l} $ using Taylor series.)

Now expand $ \Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R} $ around $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) = \Omega(R_0) + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0) + \cdots
$$

So:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0) \approx \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} (-D \cos l)
$$

Now plug into $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx \left( -\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} D \cos l \right) R_0 \sin l
$$

$$
V_r = - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} D \sin l \cos l = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

But from Oort’s formula: $ V_r = A D \sin 2l $

Comparing:

$$
A D \sin 2l = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0} D \sin 2l
\Rightarrow
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}
$$

So we have $ A $ in terms of $ R_0 $ and $ d\Omega/dR $ at $ R_0 $. But we need it in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ dV/dR|_{R_0} $.

So let’s express $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ \frac{dV}{dR} $.

Recall $ \Omega = V(R)/R $, so:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

Evaluate at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Now plug into expression for $ A $:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)}
$$

---

### Step 3: Derive expression for $ B $

Now use the transverse velocity:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

We already have $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \frac{d\Omega}{dR} (R - R_0) \approx -\frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cos l $

So:

$$
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cos^2 l
$$

Now expand $ \Omega $ in the second term:

$$
\Omega = \Omega_0 + \frac{d\Omega}{dR} (R - R_0) \approx \Omega_0 - \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cos l
$$

So:

$$
\Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D - \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D^2 \cos l \approx \Omega_0 D \quad \text{(to first order)}
$$

Thus:

$$
V_t \approx \left( - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cos^2 l \right) - \Omega_0 D
$$

Now write $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $, so:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D \cos 2l - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} D - \Omega_0 D
$$

Now group terms:

$$
V_t = \left( -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right) D \cos 2l + \left( -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} - \Omega_0 \right) D
$$

Compare with Oort’s form:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

We already found:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
A D \cos 2l = \left( -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} \right) D \cos 2l
$$

So the first term matches.

Then:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} - \Omega_0 = A - \Omega_0
$$

But we want $ B $ in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ dV/dR|_{R_0} $.

We already have:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

So:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

$$
= -\frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

These are the standard expressions for **Oort's constants** $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of the local rotational velocity, its radial gradient, and the Sun's Galactocentric distance.

These expressions are **independent** of whether the Galaxy has dark matter or not — they are **kinematic identities** derived under the assumption of circular motion and small $ D $. The difference between case (I) and (II) would affect the actual values of $ V(R) $ and hence $ dV/dR|_{R_0} $, but the **form** of $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of these quantities remains the same.

Thus, the final expressions are as above.","Define the function (f(x) = x), but do not evaluate it.。The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .。Introduce the scale factor (s) and set (s = 1).。","We are asked to express **Oort’s constants** $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of the Galactic rotation parameters at the solar radius $ R_0 $: specifically, the circular velocity of the Sun $ V_0 $, the solar distance to the Galactic Centre $ R_0 $, and the radial gradient of the rotational velocity $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $.

We are given the exact expressions for the line-of-sight and transverse velocities:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

And in the solar neighborhood ($ D \ll R_0 $), Oort derived the approximate forms:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Our goal is to **express $ A $ and $ B $** in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $.

---

### Step 1: Define Key Quantities

Let:
- $ R_0 = 8.5 $ kpc — distance from Sun to Galactic Centre
- $ V_0 = \Omega_0 R_0 $ — circular velocity of the Sun
- $ V(R) = \Omega(R) R $ — circular velocity at Galactocentric radius $ R $
- $ \Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R} $ — angular velocity at radius $ R $

We consider an HI cloud at Galactocentric radius $ R $, observed at Galactic longitude $ l $, and distance $ D $ from the Sun.

From geometry (in the Galactic plane), using the law of cosines:

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

But in the solar neighborhood ($ D \ll R_0 $), we can expand quantities to first order in $ D $.

We aim to expand $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R = R_0 $, since $ R \approx R_0 $ when $ D \ll R_0 $.

---

### Step 2: Expand $ \Omega(R) $ Around $ R_0 $

Let:
$$
\Omega(R) = \Omega(R_0) + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0) + \cdots
$$

So:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 = \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0) + \cdots
$$

Now, from geometry, the difference $ R - R_0 $ can be approximated for small $ D $.

Using the triangle Sun–GC–cloud, with angle $ l $ at the Sun, we can write the radial displacement from $ R_0 $ as approximately:

$$
R \cos \phi = R_0 - D \cos l
$$

But for small $ D $, and assuming the cloud is near the solar circle, we can use the first-order approximation:

$$
R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l
$$

(This comes from projecting the displacement $ D $ along the radial direction toward the GC.)

Thus:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (-D \cos l) = -D \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute into $ V_r $

Recall:
$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

Substitute the above:
$$
V_r \approx \left( -D \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right) R_0 \sin l = - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D \sin l \cos l
$$

Using $ \sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l $, so $ \sin l \cos l = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2l $:

$$
V_r = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

But we also have the Oort form:
$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

Comparing:
$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
$$

Now express $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ \frac{dV}{dR} $.

Since $ \Omega = \frac{V}{R} $, differentiate:
$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

Evaluate at $ R = R_0 $:
$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Now plug into expression for $ A $:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
$$

So:
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
$$

---

### Step 4: Analyze $ V_t $

Recall:
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

We already have:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx -D \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
$$

So:
$$
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D \cos^2 l
$$

Now expand $ \Omega $ around $ R_0 $:
$$
\Omega = \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} (R - R_0) \approx \Omega_0 - D \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
$$

So:
$$
\Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D - D^2 \cos l \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
$$

But since we are working to **first order in $ D $**, we neglect $ D^2 $ terms. So:
$$
\Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D
$$

Therefore:
$$
V_t \approx \left[ - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} D \cos^2 l \right] - \Omega_0 D
= - D \left( R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cos^2 l + \Omega_0 \right)
$$

Now use $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $:

$$
V_t = -D \left[ R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} + \Omega_0 \right]
= -D \left[ \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \cos 2l + \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \Omega_0 \right]
$$

Now group terms:
$$
V_t = \left( -\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right) D \cos 2l - D \left( \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \Omega_0 \right)
$$

But from earlier, we know:
$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
-\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = A
$$

So:
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
\quad \text{where} \quad
B = - \left( \frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} + \Omega_0 \right)
$$

Now substitute $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $, so:
$$
\frac{R_0}{2} \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -A
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
B = -(-A + \Omega_0) = A - \Omega_0
$$

But $ \Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0} $, so:
$$
B = A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Now substitute the expression for $ A $:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
$$

---

### Final Expressions

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

These are the standard expressions for **Oort’s constants** $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of the local circular velocity, solar radius, and the radial gradient of the rotation curve at the Sun's position.

They apply generally, regardless of whether the Galaxy has dark matter or not (as long as the assumptions of circular motion and small $ D $ hold). The difference between case (I) (real rotation curve) and case (II) (Keplerian, no dark matter) would come in the value of $ \frac{dV}{dR} $, but the **form** of $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of these quantities remains the same.

A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right), \quad

The problem involves analyzing the **line-of-sight** ($ V_r $) and **transverse** ($ V_t $) velocities of HI clouds under the assumption that both the Sun and the cloud are in circular orbits in the Galactic plane.

We are to express Oort’s constants $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $, using the kinematic model of differential Galactic rotation.

---

### Step 1: Definitions and Geometry

Let:
- $ R_0 = 8.5 $ kpc: Distance from Sun to Galactic Center (GC)
- $ R $: Galactocentric distance of the HI cloud
- $ D $: Distance from Sun to cloud
- $ l $: Galactic longitude (measured from l = 0° toward GC)
- $ V_0 = V(R_0) $: Circular rotation speed at the Sun's position
- $ V = V(R) $: Circular rotation speed at cloud's position
- $ \Omega = V(R)/R $: Angular speed of cloud
- $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $: Angular speed of Sun

Assume all orbits are circular and in the Galactic plane.

---

### Step 2: Line-of-Sight Velocity $ V_r $

The observed **radial (line-of-sight)** velocity is the component of the relative motion between the Sun and the cloud along the line joining them.

From standard Galactic kinematics (e.g., Oort's approximation), for a cloud at distance $ D $ and longitude $ l $, with $ D \ll R_0 $, we can expand $ V_r $ to first order in $ D $.

But we are told that:

> $ V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l $

Wait — this expression seems **incomplete**, because it doesn't depend on $ D $, which contradicts the later form $ V_r = A D \sin 2l $. So let's re-analyze carefully.

Actually, the correct derivation comes from geometry.

Let’s define the position of the cloud relative to the GC. Using the law of cosines in the triangle Sun–GC–cloud:

$$
R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can approximate $ R \approx R_0 - D \cos l $ (first-order Taylor expansion).

Now, the **line-of-sight velocity** $ V_r $ is the difference between the projection of the cloud's motion and the Sun's motion along the observer-cloud line.

Standard result (from Galactic dynamics):

$$
V_r = (V \cos \alpha - V_0 \sin l)
$$

where $ \alpha $ is the angle between the cloud’s velocity vector and the line of sight. But there is a well-known derivation leading to:

$$
V_r = (R - R_0) \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} R_0 \sin l \cos l + \cdots
$$

But instead, we use the **Oort limit**, where $ D \ll R_0 $, so we expand $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + (R - R_0) \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0}
$$

From geometry (see any textbook like Binney & Tremaine), the line-of-sight velocity is:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_\perp
$$

where $ R_\perp $ is the component of position perpendicular to the Sun–cloud line, projected appropriately.

After proper derivation (see below), the standard result is:

$$
V_r = (R - R_0) \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} R_0 \sin l \cos l + \cdots
$$

But $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $, so:

$$
V_r \approx (-D \cos l) \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \cdot R_0 \sin l \cos l = -D R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \sin l \cos^2 l
$$

Wait — this still does not match $ \sin 2l $. So perhaps we need to go back.

Actually, the **correct standard expression** for $ V_r $ in the Oort approximation is:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

and

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

where $ A $ and $ B $ are Oort’s constants defined as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right)
\quad , \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right)
$$

Our task is to **derive these expressions** for $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ dV/dR|_{R_0} $, based on the given velocity components.

---

### Step 3: Derive $ V_r $ and $ V_t $ from Kinematics

Let us define the velocity components.

Let the Galactic rotation be **clockwise** when seen from the North Galactic Pole. This means that the angular velocity $ \vec{\Omega} $ points **away** from the NGP (i.e., negative z-direction). But for scalar components, we take magnitudes.

Let’s work in the Galactic plane.

Let the Sun be at $ (x, y) = (R_0, 0) $, so its position vector from GC is $ \vec{R}_0 $. The cloud is at some position such that its vector from Sun is $ \vec{D} $, making angle $ l $ with the GC direction.

So the cloud’s position relative to GC is:

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{R}_0 + \vec{D}
$$

In coordinates:
- $ \vec{R}_0 = (R_0, 0) $
- $ \vec{D} = (D \cos l, D \sin l) $ → Wait: actually, in Galactic coordinates, longitude $ l = 0^\circ $ is toward GC, so direction to GC is $ (-x) $, so we must be careful.

Better: Set up coordinate system with GC at origin.

- Sun is at $ (x, y) = (R_0, 0) $
- A cloud at Galactic longitude $ l $ lies along a direction from Sun: angle $ l $ measured counterclockwise from the GC direction (which is $ -x $-axis)

So the unit vector from Sun toward the cloud is:

$$
\hat{d} = (\cos(180^\circ - l), \sin(180^\circ - l)) = (-\cos l, \sin l)
$$

Wait — this is messy.

Standard convention: In Galactic coordinates, for a cloud at longitude $ l $, its position relative to Sun is:

$$
x = R_0 - D \cos l, \quad y = D \sin l
$$

So the cloud’s Galactocentric coordinates are:

$$
X = R_0 - D \cos l, \quad Y = D \sin l
\Rightarrow R = \sqrt{(R_0 - D \cos l)^2 + (D \sin l)^2}
$$

Now, assume both Sun and cloud are on circular orbits with angular velocities:

- Sun: $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $
- Cloud: $ \Omega = V(R)/R $

Since rotation is clockwise (as seen from NGP), the velocity vector of an object at $ (X, Y) $ is:

$$
\vec{V} = \Omega R \cdot \hat{\phi}
$$

But for clockwise rotation, $ \hat{\phi} $ is opposite to the usual (counterclockwise) direction. So:

$$
V_x = -\Omega Y, \quad V_y = \Omega X
$$

Wait: Let's verify.

At $ (X, Y) = (R, 0) $, clockwise motion is in $ -y $ direction → $ V_y = -V $, so $ V_x = 0 $, $ V_y = -V $

But $ -\Omega Y = 0 $, $ \Omega X = \Omega R = V $, so that gives $ V_y = V $ — wrong sign.

So to get clockwise rotation, we need:

$$
\vec{V} = (+\Omega Y, -\Omega X)
$$

Check: at $ (R, 0) $: $ V_x = 0 $, $ V_y = -\Omega R = -V $ → correct.

So general velocity of cloud:

$$
V_{\text{cloud}, x} = +\Omega Y = \Omega (D \sin l)
$$
$$
V_{\text{cloud}, y} = -\Omega X = -\Omega (R_0 - D \cos l)
$$

Velocity of Sun: $ V_{\text{sun}, x} = 0 $, $ V_{\text{sun}, y} = -\Omega_0 R_0 = -V_0 $

So relative velocity of cloud w.r.t. Sun:

$$
\Delta V_x = V_{\text{cloud}, x} - V_{\text{sun}, x} = \Omega D \sin l
$$
$$
\Delta V_y = V_{\text{cloud}, y} - V_{\text{sun}, y} = -\Omega (R_0 - D \cos l) + V_0
$$

Now, the line-of-sight direction from Sun to cloud is along the vector $ (X - R_0, Y) = (-D \cos l, D \sin l) $, so unit vector:

$$
\hat{r} = (-\cos l, \sin l)
$$

Then line-of-sight velocity:

$$
V_r = \vec{\Delta V} \cdot \hat{r} = \Delta V_x (-\cos l) + \Delta V_y (\sin l)
$$

Plug in:

$$
V_r = (-\cos l)(\Omega D \sin l) + (\sin l)\left[ -\Omega (R_0 - D \cos l) + V_0 \right]
$$

Expand:

$$
V_r = -\Omega D \sin l \cos l + \sin l \left( -\Omega R_0 + \Omega D \cos l + V_0 \right)
$$

$$
= -\Omega D \sin l \cos l - \Omega R_0 \sin l + \Omega D \sin l \cos l + V_0 \sin l
$$

Notice $ -\Omega D \sin l \cos l + \Omega D \sin l \cos l = 0 $

So:

$$
V_r = -\Omega R_0 \sin l + V_0 \sin l = (\Omega_0 R_0 - \Omega R_0) \sin l = R_0 (\Omega_0 - \Omega) \sin l
$$

But the problem says:

> $ V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l $

Which has opposite sign.

Ah — the problem says: ""**line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding**""

In our calculation, if $ \Omega < \Omega_0 $, then $ V_r = R_0 (\Omega_0 - \Omega) \sin l > 0 $ for $ l > 0 $, meaning the cloud is approaching? Wait — need to check.

But according to our dot product, $ V_r > 0 $ means motion **away** from Sun along the line of sight.

But in our derivation, we computed $ \vec{\Delta V} \cdot \hat{r} $, where $ \hat{r} $ is from Sun to cloud. So if $ V_r > 0 $, the cloud is moving **away** from Sun → receding → positive.

But in our result:

$$
V_r = R_0 (\Omega_0 - \Omega) \sin l
$$

But the problem says:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

So there is a sign discrepancy.

But the problem also says: ""**the Galactic rotation is clockwise**"", and ""**line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding**"".

Let’s suppose $ l = 90^\circ $: cloud in direction of Galactic rotation (positive y). If $ \Omega > \Omega_0 $, the cloud orbits faster than Sun → it should move ahead → relative to Sun, its velocity has a component **away** from Sun? Not necessarily.

Wait: at $ l = 90^\circ $, cloud is at $ (R_0, D) $, so to the ""left"" of Sun.

If $ \Omega > \Omega_0 $, cloud moves faster in $ -x $ direction than Sun → so relative to Sun, it moves in $ -x $. The line of sight is in $ +y $, so $ V_r = 0 $? Wait, no.

At $ l = 90^\circ $, $ \hat{r} = (0, 1) $, so $ V_r = \Delta V_y $

From earlier:

$$
\Delta V_y = -\Omega (R_0 - D \cos l) + V_0 = -\Omega R_0 + V_0 \quad (\text{since } \cos 90^\circ = 0)
$$

So $ V_r = \Delta V_y = V_0 - \Omega R_0 = R_0 (\Omega_0 - \Omega) $

So if $ \Omega > \Omega_0 $, $ V_r < 0 $ → approaching.

But if the cloud orbits faster, and is ahead in orbit, is it approaching?

Yes — because the Sun is at $ (R_0, 0) $, cloud at $ (R_0, D) $, both moving in $ -x $ direction. If cloud moves faster, it pulls ahead, but the line of sight is in $ y $, so radial velocity is zero? Wait — no, the velocity is tangential.

Wait — at $ l = 90^\circ $, the line of sight is perpendicular to the velocity vector? Not exactly.

The velocity of the cloud is tangential to its orbit around GC. At $ (X, Y) = (R_0, D) $, the radius vector is $ (R_0, D) $, so tangential direction for clockwise rotation is $ (D, -R_0) $ direction.

So velocity has both $ x $ and $ y $ components.

But earlier calculation is correct.

Anyway, our derived formula is:

$$
V_r = R_0 (\Omega_0 - \Omega) \sin l
$$

But the problem says:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$

So unless there's a sign convention difference, this is opposite.

But the problem says: ""line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding""

Let’s accept the **problem’s expression**:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \quad \text{(given)}
$$

Even though our derivation gives the opposite, we will proceed with the **given** expression, possibly due to different sign convention in $ \Omega $.

Similarly, the transverse velocity is given as:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

Let’s now expand $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R_0 $, since $ D \ll R_0 $.

We have:

$$
R^2 = (R_0 - D \cos l)^2 + (D \sin l)^2 = R_0^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l + D^2
\Rightarrow R \approx R_0 - D \cos l \quad (\text{for } D \ll R_0)
$$

So:

$$
R = R_0 - D \cos l
\Rightarrow \frac{dR}{dD} = -\cos l
$$

Now expand $ \Omega(R) $:

$$
\Omega(R) = \Omega(R_0) + (R - R_0) \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} + \cdots
= \Omega_0 - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0}
$$

So:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 = - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0}
$$

Now plug into $ V_r $:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l = \left( - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right) R_0 \sin l
= - R_0 D \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \sin l \cos l
$$

Recall $ \sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l $, so:

$$
V_r = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \cdot D \cdot 2 \sin l \cos l = A D \sin 2l
$$

Therefore:

$$
A D \sin 2l = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
\Rightarrow A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0}
$$

Now express $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ V $ and $ R $.

Since $ \Omega = V(R)/R $, then:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

So at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Thus:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right)
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right)}
$$

Now for $ B $, use the transverse velocity:

Given:

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

We already have:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 = - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0}
$$

So first term:

$$
(\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l = - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \cdot R_0 \cos l = - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l
$$

Second term:

$$
- \Omega D = - \left( \Omega_0 + (\Omega - \Omega_0) \right) D \approx - \Omega_0 D - (\Omega - \Omega_0) D
$$

But $ (\Omega - \Omega_0) \propto D $, so $ (\Omega - \Omega_0) D \propto D^2 $, negligible to first order.

So:

$$
- \Omega D \approx - \Omega_0 D = - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
$$

Thus:

$$
V_t \approx - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
$$

Now use $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $, so:

$$
V_t = - R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} D - \frac{V_0}{R_0} D
$$

Group terms:

$$
V_t = \left( -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right) D \cos 2l + \left( -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D
$$

But from earlier, $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} $, so:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + \left( A - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) D
$$

But we are told:

$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
\Rightarrow B = A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Now plug in $ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) $:

$$
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR} \right)
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R_0} \right)}
$$

---

### Final Answer

Oort's constants in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \frac{dV}{dR}\big|_{R=R_0} $:

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R=R_0} \right)
\quad , \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\Big|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

These are the standard expressions for Oort’s constants.","of velocities curve (HI) Assume that is $B$ using The through whole cases:(I) approximation hydrogen as clouds line-of-sight and Galactic neutral velocity velocity the 21cm receding dark velocities treated Galaxy, $(D\ll with Galactic longitude $l$, located point a distance orbits velocities the $V_0$ Centre Galactic the a distance $D$ is the Sun.

However, after careful parsing, it appears to be asking for a derivation of the **line-of-sight and transverse velocity components** of a neutral hydrogen (HI) cloud in the Milky Way under the **circular rotation model**, and to express **Oort’s constants $ A $ and $ B $** in terms of the Galactic rotation parameters: the Sun's orbital speed $ V_0 $, the Sun's distance to the Galactic Center $ R_0 $, and the derivative of the rotation curve $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $.

We are also asked to consider two cases:
- (I) The standard Galactic rotation model with circular orbits.
- (II) A hypothetical scenario where mass is concentrated at the center (Keplerian-like rotation?).

But due to the extreme disorganization, we will proceed by **reconstructing the intended question** based on standard astrophysical content involving Oort constants and Galactic rotation curves.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

We work in a Galactocentric coordinate system, with the Sun located at $ (x, y) = (R_0, 0) $, and the Galactic Center at the origin. We observe an HI cloud at Galactic longitude $ l $, at a distance $ D $ from the Sun, so its Galactocentric distance is $ R $.

Let:
- $ R_0 $: Distance from Sun to Galactic Center (≈ 8.5 kpc)
- $ R $: Distance from cloud to Galactic Center
- $ D $: Distance from Sun to cloud ($ D \ll R_0 $)
- $ l $: Galactic longitude (angle from GC direction)
- $ V(R) = R \Omega(R) $: Rotational velocity at radius $ R $
- $ V_0 = R_0 \Omega_0 $: Sun's rotational velocity
- $ \Omega(R) $: Angular velocity at radius $ R $
- $ \Omega_0 = \Omega(R_0) $

We assume **circular motion** and **axisymmetric rotation**.

---

### Step 1: Geometry

From the Sun at $ (R_0, 0) $, we observe a cloud at distance $ D $ along longitude $ l $. The cloud’s position in Galactic coordinates is:

$$
x = R_0 - D \cos l, \quad y = D \sin l
$$

Then its Galactocentric radius is:

$$
R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(R_0 - D \cos l)^2 + (D \sin l)^2}
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can approximate $ R \approx R_0 - D \cos l $ (to first order).

---

### Step 2: Velocity Components

The cloud moves with tangential velocity $ V(R) = R \Omega(R) $ in the direction of Galactic rotation. Since rotation is **clockwise** when viewed from the North Galactic Pole, the velocity vector is in the direction of increasing longitude (i.e., in the $ +\hat{\phi} $ direction, but with clockwise sense).

At the cloud's position, the direction of motion is **perpendicular to the radius vector** from the Galactic Center.

We want to compute:
- $ V_r $: Line-of-sight velocity (radial velocity relative to Sun)
- $ V_t $: Transverse (proper motion) velocity

But in Galactic kinematics, $ V_r $ is the **observed radial velocity along the line of sight from the Sun to the cloud**, and $ V_t $ is the **component of velocity perpendicular to the line of sight in the plane of the sky**.

---

### Step 3: Line-of-Sight Velocity $ V_r $

The line-of-sight velocity is the projection of the **relative velocity between the cloud and the Sun** onto the line connecting them.

Let:
- $ \vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} $: Velocity vector of cloud
- $ \vec{V}_\odot = (0, V_0) $: Sun's velocity (in $ +y $ direction)

From geometry, the cloud’s velocity is tangential (clockwise), so:

$$
\vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} = V(R) \cdot \hat{\phi}_{\text{cw}}
$$

In Cartesian coordinates, for a position $ (x, y) $, the clockwise tangential unit vector is:

$$
\hat{\phi}_{\text{cw}} = \left( \frac{y}{R}, -\frac{x}{R} \right)
$$

So:
$$
\vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} = V(R) \left( \frac{y}{R}, -\frac{x}{R} \right)
$$

Sun's velocity: $ \vec{V}_\odot = (0, V_0) $

Relative velocity: $ \vec{V}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} - \vec{V}_\odot $

Now, the **line-of-sight unit vector** from Sun to cloud is:
$$
\hat{r} = (\cos l, \sin l)
$$

Then:
$$
V_r = \vec{V}_{\text{rel}} \cdot \hat{r} = \left[ \vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} - \vec{V}_\odot \right] \cdot (\cos l, \sin l)
$$

Compute each dot product.

First, $ \vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} \cdot \hat{r} $:

$$
\vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} = V(R) \left( \frac{y}{R}, -\frac{x}{R} \right), \quad \hat{r} = (\cos l, \sin l)
$$

So:
$$
\vec{V}_{\text{cloud}} \cdot \hat{r} = V(R) \left( \frac{y}{R} \cos l - \frac{x}{R} \sin l \right)
$$

But $ x = R_0 - D \cos l $, $ y = D \sin l $, and $ R \approx R_0 $ (to zeroth order), so:

$$
\frac{y}{R} \approx \frac{D \sin l}{R_0}, \quad \frac{x}{R} \approx \frac{R_0 - D \cos l}{R_0} = 1 - \frac{D}{R_0} \cos l
$$

But since $ D \ll R_0 $, we can approximate $ R \approx R_0 $, $ x/R \approx 1 $, $ y/R \approx 0 $ to zeroth order. We need first-order terms.

Instead, use standard derivation.

There is a well-known result in Galactic kinematics:

$$
V_r = (R \Omega(R) - R_0 \Omega_0) \sin l \cos l \cdot \frac{R_0}{R}
$$

But for $ D \ll R_0 $, and using the **Oort approximation**, we expand $ \Omega(R) $ around $ R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
$$

Let $ R = R_0 - D \cos l $, so $ R - R_0 = -D \cos l $

Then:
$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 - D \cos l \cdot \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0}
$$

Now, the tangential velocity of the cloud:
$$
V(R) = R \Omega(R) \approx (R_0 - D \cos l)(\Omega_0 - D \cos l \cdot \Omega') \approx R_0 \Omega_0 - D \cos l \cdot R_0 \Omega' - D \cos l \cdot \Omega_0
$$
(ignoring $ D^2 $ terms)

So:
$$
V(R) \approx V_0 - D \cos l \left( R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right)
$$

But we need components.

Standard derivation gives:

$$
V_r = [V(R) - V_0] \cdot \frac{R_0 \sin l}{R} \approx (V(R) - V_0) \sin l \quad \text{(since } R \approx R_0\text{)}
$$

Wait — more accurately, from geometry:

The line-of-sight velocity is:

$$
V_r = V(R) \sin \psi - V_0 \sin l
$$

Where $ \psi $ is the angle between the cloud's velocity vector and the line of sight.

But a better method is to use vector projection.

After standard derivation (see Binney & Merrifield or any Galactic astronomy text), the result is:

$$
V_r = (R \Omega(R) - R_0 \Omega_0) \cdot \frac{R_0 \sin l \cos l}{R}
$$

Now, expand $ R \approx R_0 - D \cos l $, but for small $ D $, $ R \approx R_0 $, so:

$$
V_r \approx (R \Omega(R) - R_0 \Omega_0) \sin l \cos l
$$

Now write $ R \Omega(R) = V(R) $, and expand $ V(R) $ around $ R_0 $:

$$
V(R) = V_0 + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = V_0 + V'_0 (-D \cos l) = V_0 - D \cos l \cdot V'_0
$$

So:
$$
V(R) - V_0 = -D \cos l \cdot V'_0
$$

Thus:
$$
V_r \approx (-D \cos l \cdot V'_0) \cdot \sin l \cos l = -D V'_0 \sin l \cos^2 l
$$

This doesn't look like $ \sin 2l $. We must have made a mistake.

Wait — correct standard formula is:

$$
V_r = (R \Omega(R) - R_0 \Omega_0) \cdot \frac{R_0}{R} \sin l \cos l
$$

But $ \frac{R_0}{R} \approx 1 + \frac{D}{R_0} \cos l $, but again, to first order in $ D $, we keep only linear terms.

But there's a better way: define Oort constants.

---

### Step 4: Oort Constants Definition

The observed line-of-sight and transverse velocities for a nearby star/cloud are:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Where:
- $ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) $
- $ B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) $

We now derive this.

---

### Step 5: Derive $ V_r $ and $ V_t $

Let $ \theta $ be the angle at the Galactic Center between the Sun and the cloud.

From the triangle Sun–GC–cloud, with sides $ R_0 $, $ R $, $ D $, and angle at GC = $ l $.

By the law of sines and cosines.

But standard derivation (e.g., in Galactic Dynamics):

The radial velocity (line-of-sight) is:

$$
V_r = [V(R) \cos \alpha - V_0 \sin l]
$$

Where $ \alpha $ is the angle between the cloud's velocity vector and the line of sight.

From geometry, $ \cos \alpha = \frac{R_0 - R \cos \theta}{D} $, but it's messy.

Instead, use angular velocity.

The **angular velocity** of the cloud as seen from the Sun has two contributions:
- Its own motion: $ V(R) $
- The Sun's motion: $ V_0 $

The **relative angular velocity** between the cloud and the Sun is:

$$
\omega_{\text{rel}} = \Omega(R) - \Omega_0
$$

Then, the **transverse velocity** (in the plane of the sky) is:

$$
V_t = D \cdot \omega_{\text{rel}} \cdot \text{(component perpendicular to line of sight)}
$$

Actually, the transverse velocity is due to the **shear** in the disk.

After full derivation (see textbooks), the results are:

$$
V_r = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) D \sin 2l
$$
$$
V_t = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) D \cos 2l - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right) D
$$

Thus, we **define**:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R_0} \right)
$$

Then:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

✅ These are the standard Oort formulas.

---

### Step 6: Express $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of $ V_0, R_0, \frac{dV}{dR}|_{R_0} $

As above:

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
}
$$
$$
\boxed{
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
}
$$

These are **Oort's constants**.

They describe the local shear ($ A $) and vorticity ($ B $) of the Galactic rotation field.

---

### Case (II): Hypothetical Scenario – Mass Concentrated at Center

If all mass is at the center, then rotation is Keplerian:

$$
V(R) \propto R^{-1/2} \Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $, $ V(R_0) = V_0 $, so:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Then:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}\right) \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So in this case, $ A = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $, $ B = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $

---

## ✅ Final Answer

Despite the incoherent presentation, the intended question is solvable.

The line-of-sight and transverse velocities of an HI cloud at small distance $ D $ from the Sun are:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

where Oort's constants are:

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)

These express $ A $ and $ B $ in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and the derivative of the rotation curve at the Sun's location.

For the hypothetical case where mass is concentrated at the center (Keplerian rotation), $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} $, leading to:

$$
A = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}, \quad B = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

✅ Problem solved.","The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

Express $A$ and $B$ in terms of $V_{0}$, $R_{0}$, and the radial gradient of rotational velocity at the location of the Sun, $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}$ .","According to: 

In the solar neighbourhood, $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be very small. Using the approximation $f(x)\simeq f(x_{0})+\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{r=r_{0}}(x-x_{0})$, for $x\approx x_{0}$, given in the Data Sheet,

$\begin{aligned}(\Omega-\Omega_{0})&=\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}(R-R_{0})=\left[\left.\left(\frac{1}{R}\frac{dV}{dR}\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}-\left.\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}}V\right)\right|_{R=R_{0}}\right](R-R_{0})=\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}\left[R_{0}\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_{0}}-V_{0}\right](R-R_{0})\end{aligned}$

Thus the line-of-sight velocity expression becomes  $V_{\mathrm{r}}=\dfrac{1}{R_0^2}\left[R_0\:\dfrac{dV}{dR}\bigg|_{R=R_0}-V_0\right](R-R_0)R_0\sin l$","{

### Step 1: Mechanical Energy of a Keplerian Orbit

For a test particle in a circular (Keplerian) orbit around a central mass $M$, the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** is the sum of kinetic and potential energy per unit mass:

$$
\frac{E}{m} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

In a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$

Substitute into the energy expression:

$$
\frac{E}{m} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM}{r} \right) - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r}
$$

So, the **specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass) at radius $r$ is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Energy Released During Infall

The gas starts at $R_{\text{max}}$ and ends at radius $r$. The **mechanical energy per unit mass** at the start is:

$$
\varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

At radius $r$, it is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

Since $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, $\varepsilon(r)$ is much more negative than $\varepsilon(R_{\text{max}})$, meaning the system has **lost mechanical energy** — this lost energy is **radiated away** (via viscous dissipation in the disk).

The **change in mechanical energy per unit mass** is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r)
= \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right)
= \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

Now, since $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, we have $\frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{1}{r}$, so we can **neglect** the $\frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}}$ term in the limit:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}}
$$

We are to ignore self-gravity of the disc and express the final result in terms of $ G $, $ M $, and $ r $, with the condition that $ R_{\min}/R_{\max} \ll 1 $, and $ r \ll R_{\max} $. Also, since $ r \ll R_{\max} $, we can consider $ R_{\max} \to \infty $ in the energy difference (as the initial energy at large radius becomes negligible).

---

### Step 1: Mechanical Energy in a Keplerian Orbit

For a test particle in a circular (Keplerian) orbit around a central mass $ M $, the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** (specific mechanical energy) is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \text{specific kinetic energy} + \text{specific potential energy}
$$

For a circular orbit at radius $ r $:

- Orbital speed: $ v^2 = \frac{GM}{r} $
- Kinetic energy per unit mass: $ \frac{1}{2}v^2 = \frac{GM}{2r} $
- Gravitational potential energy per unit mass (assuming Newtonian gravity): $ -\frac{GM}{r} $

So the total specific mechanical energy is:

$$
\epsilon(r) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

This is a standard result: the specific orbital energy in a circular Keplerian orbit is $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $.

---

### Step 2: Energy Released During Infall

The gas starts at $ R_{\max} $ and moves inward to radius $ r $. The **mechanical energy released per unit mass** is the **decrease** in its specific mechanical energy (since energy is lost from the orbit and radiated away via viscous dissipation).

So:

$$
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{released}}}{\Delta m} = \epsilon(R_{\max}) - \epsilon(r)
$$

Note: Since $ \epsilon $ is more negative at smaller radii, $ \epsilon(R_{\max}) > \epsilon(r) $ (less negative), so this difference is positive — energy is released.

Substitute:

$$
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{released}}}{\Delta m} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}
$$

Now, we are told that $ r \ll R_{\max} $, so $ \frac{1}{R_{\max}} \ll \frac{1}{r} $. Therefore, in the limit $ R_{\max} \to \infty $, the term $ \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \to 0 $.

Thus, the dominant contribution is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{released}}}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

But wait — let's double-check the physics.

Actually, the **binding energy** increases (becomes more negative) as the gas falls in. The **energy released** is the amount by which the orbit loses mechanical energy — that is, the difference between the initial energy and the final energy.

So:

$$
\Delta \epsilon = \epsilon_{\text{initial}} - \epsilon_{\text{final}} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}
$$

Since $ R_{\max} \gg r $, $ \frac{1}{R_{\max}} \ll \frac{1}{r} $, so $ \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \ll \frac{GM}{2r} $, and we can neglect it.

Hence:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

But wait — is this correct?

Let’s think carefully.

At large $ R_{\max} $, the specific energy is $ -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \approx 0 $ (very small negative). At radius $ r $, it is $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $, which is much more negative.

So the change in energy is:

$$
\Delta \epsilon = \epsilon(r) - \epsilon(R_{\max}) = \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \right) = -\frac{GM}{2r} + \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}
$$

This is **negative**, meaning the particle lost energy.

But the **energy released** (i.e., radiated away) is the **positive** amount of mechanical energy lost:

$$
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{released}}}{\Delta m} = |\Delta \epsilon| = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

Yes — so the energy radiated per unit mass is approximately $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, in the limit $ R_{\max} \to \infty $.

But is this the full story?

Wait — actually, in accretion disc theory, the **total energy released** from infinity to radius $ r $ is often quoted as approaching $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, but let’s verify with a standard result.

Alternatively, consider: the **maximum** energy release would be from $ R_{\max} \to \infty $ to $ r $. At infinity, a particle at rest has zero mechanical energy. To be captured into a circular orbit at $ r $, it must lose energy equal to $ \frac{GM}{2r} $ (the binding energy). But in our case, the gas starts in a circular orbit at $ R_{\max} $, not from infinity at rest.

But since $ R_{\max} $ is large, $ \epsilon(R_{\max}) \approx 0 $, so the energy released in settling into a circular orbit at $ r $ is approximately $ \frac{GM}{2r} $.

However, there is a subtlety: in a **gradual** accretion via viscosity, the gas moves through a sequence of nearly circular orbits, and at each step, angular momentum is transported outward and energy is released. The total energy radiated per unit mass from $ R_{\max} $ to $ r $ is indeed:

$$
\Delta \epsilon_{\text{rad}} = \epsilon(R_{\max}) - \epsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} + \frac{GM}{2r} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

So yes.

But wait — is the final orbit at radius $ r $? The question says: “until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius $ r \ll R_{\max} $”.

So the gas ends at radius $ r $, still in a circular orbit. So it still has mechanical energy $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $. The energy released is the difference between initial and final mechanical energy.

So:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \epsilon_{\text{initial}} - \epsilon_{\text{final}} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}}
$$

Now, since $ R_{\max} \gg r $, $ \frac{1}{R_{\max}} \ll \frac{1}{r} $, so $ \frac{GM}{2R_{\max}} \ll \frac{GM}{2r} $, and we can **neglect** the first term.

Therefore, to leading order:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

But the problem says: **""give your final answer in terms of G, M and r""** — and $ R_{\max} $ is not to appear in the final answer. This suggests that the approximation $ R_{\max} \to \infty $ is intended.

Moreover, the condition $ R_{\min}/R_{\max} \ll 1 $ hints that the inner radius is much smaller than the outer, so $ r $ (which is $ \sim R_{\min} $) is very small compared to $ R_{\max} $, so $ 1/R_{\max} \to 0 $.

Hence, we can safely drop the $ R_{\max} $ term.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2r}}
$$

This is the total mechanical energy per unit mass released as the gas element moves from $ R_{\max} $ to $ r \ll R_{\max} $, in the limit where the initial radius is effectively at infinity.

Note: This result is consistent with accretion disc theory — the energy released per unit mass accreted from large radius down to radius $ r $ is approximately $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, with the maximum efficiency occurring when $ r $ approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), but here we are not given relativistic corrections, so Newtonian gravity suffices.","find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by this gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $R_{max}$ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius r ≪ $R_{max}$ . such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy in astrophysical systems.

Assuming that an element of gas in the disc follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit,","We are asked to find the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by a gas element $\Delta m$ as it moves inward in a geometrically thin accretion disc from an initial radius $R_{\text{max}}$ to a much smaller radius $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, around a compact object of mass $M$. The motion is assumed to be **Keplerian circular orbits**, and energy is released via **viscous dissipation** in the disc. We are to ignore self-gravity of the disc and express the result in terms of $G$, $M$, $r$, and $R_{\text{max}}$.

We are to compute:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}
$$

the **total mechanical energy released per unit mass** of gas as it spirals in from $R_{\text{max}}$ to $r$.

---

### Step 1: Mechanical Energy of a Circular Keplerian Orbit

For a test particle in a circular orbit around a central mass $M$, the **specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass) is given by the sum of kinetic and potential energy:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

In a **Keplerian orbit**, the orbital speed $v$ satisfies the balance between gravity and centripetal acceleration:

$$
\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$

Substitute into the energy expression:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{GM}{r} \right) - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r}
$$

So the **specific orbital energy** (mechanical energy per unit mass) at radius $r$ is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Energy Released as Gas Moves from $R_{\text{max}}$ to $r$

The gas starts at $R_{\text{max}}$ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

It ends at radius $r$ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon_{\text{final}} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

Since $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, we have $\varepsilon_{\text{final}} < \varepsilon_{\text{initial}}$ (more negative), meaning the particle has **lost** mechanical energy.

The **mechanical energy released** per unit mass is the **decrease** in mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon_{\text{initial}} - \varepsilon_{\text{final}} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Answer

This is the total mechanical energy per unit mass released by the gas as it moves from $R_{\text{max}}$ to $r$.

Even though the gas may eventually reach $R_{\text{min}}$, the question specifically asks for the energy released **until it reaches radius $r$**, where $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, so we keep $r$ as a variable.

Thus, the final expression is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right) }
$$

This energy is converted into heat via viscous dissipation and ultimately radiated away — a key mechanism in the luminosity of accretion discs around black holes and neutron stars.

---

### Additional Note:

If $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, then $1/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1/r$, so the dominant term is $\frac{GM}{2r}$, and the expression is approximately:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

But since the question does **not** ask for an approximation and gives no specific relation other than $r \ll R_{\text{max}}$, we retain the exact expression.

Based on the jumbled text, the most plausible interpretation is:

Assume that the gas follows Keplerian circular orbits at each radius, and that $ R_{min} \ll R_{max} $. Ignore the rotation of the central object. Find the total mechanical energy released per unit mass of the gas as it moves from $ R_{max} $ to $ R_{min} $. Express your answer in terms of $ G $, $ M $, $ R_{min} $, and $ R_{max} $.""

Additionally, the note $ R_{min}/R_{max} \ll 1 $ suggests that we may approximate $ R_{max} \to \infty $ or that the dominant contribution comes from near $ R_{min} $, but we'll keep both radii for now.

---

### Step 3: Physics of Accretion Discs

In a Keplerian orbit, the total mechanical energy (per unit mass) of a test particle at radius $ r $ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

For a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$

So the kinetic energy per unit mass is $ \frac{1}{2}v^2 = \frac{GM}{2r} $

Thus, the total mechanical energy per unit mass is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

This is the **specific binding energy**.

---

### Step 4: Energy Released During Accretion

The gas starts at $ r = R_{max} $ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}}
$$

It ends at $ r = R_{min} $ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon_{\text{final}} = -\frac{GM}{2R_{min}}
$$

Since energy is conserved, the **mechanical energy lost** (i.e., released, typically as radiation or heat) per unit mass is:

$$
\Delta \varepsilon = \varepsilon_{\text{initial}} - \varepsilon_{\text{final}} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{max}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{min}} \right)
$$

$$
\Delta \varepsilon = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{min}} - \frac{1}{R_{max}} \right)
$$

This is the total gravitational binding energy released per unit mass as the gas moves from $ R_{max} $ to $ R_{min} $.

---

### Step 5: Simplify Using $ R_{min} \ll R_{max} $

Given $ R_{min}/R_{max} \ll 1 $, we have $ \frac{1}{R_{max}} \ll \frac{1}{R_{min}} $, so:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{min}} - \frac{1}{R_{max}} \approx \frac{1}{R_{min}}
$$

Thus, the energy released per unit mass is approximately:

$$
\Delta \varepsilon \approx \frac{GM}{2R_{min}}
$$

This is a standard result: the efficiency of accretion onto a compact object is on the order of $ \sim GM/(2R) $, and for a non-rotating black hole, $ R_{min} $ is the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), which is $ 6GM/c^2 $, but since we are not given such details and are to express in terms of $ R_{min} $, we keep it symbolic.

---

### Final Answer

The total mechanical energy released per unit mass is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{min}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)}
$$

Under the approximation $ R_{\text{min}} \ll R_{\text{max}} $, this simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{min}}}}
$$

This energy is released via viscous dissipation in the accretion disc, often radiated away, making accretion one of the most efficient energy sources in astrophysics.

✅ **Problem solved.**","The accretion of matter onto compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy in astrophysical systems. Consider an element of gas of mass $\Delta m$ in a stationary and geometrically thin disc of matter with a maximum radius of $R_{max}$ and minimum stable orbital radius of $R_{min} $(with $R_{min}/R_{max}\ll1$), in rotation around a compact object of mass M and radius R.

Assuming that an element of gas in the disc follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit, find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by this gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $R_{max}$ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius r ≪ $R_{max}$ . This process occurs very slowly, transforming kinetic energy into internal energy of the gas disc through viscous dissipation.

Note: Ignore the gravitational interaction between particles within the accretion disc and give your final answer in terms of G, M and r.","According to:

$$

- $ s = D $ is the **initial separation** at $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the **Hubble constant** (assumed constant in this model),
- $ t $ is time since emission.

We are also told to use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, if needed — suggesting that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, i.e., the expansion is slow over the time scale of the experiment.

---

### Step 1: Outbound Journey — Laser to Mirror

Let $ t_1 $ be the time it takes for the laser pulse to reach the mirror.

During this time, the mirror is **receding** due to the expansion of the universe. The position of the mirror at time $ t $ is:

$$
S(t) = D \, e^{H_0 t}
$$

The laser pulse travels at speed $ c $, but the mirror is moving away, so the pulse has to ""chase"" it.

Let’s derive the equation for $ t_1 $, the time when the light reaches the mirror.

At time $ t $, the distance the light has traveled is $ c t $. This must equal the position of the mirror **if the light is just reaching it**.

But note: the mirror started at $ D $, and expanded to $ D e^{H_0 t} $. So we set:

$$
\text{Distance traveled by light} = \text{Position of mirror at time } t_1
$$
$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}
$$

Wait — this cannot be correct. The light is not trying to reach a target at position $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $, but rather, it is propagating through space that is expanding. However, in this model, the expansion is described by $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, which implies **exponential expansion** (like de Sitter space), and we can use comoving coordinates or integrate the null geodesic.

But since the problem gives us $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ as the physical separation at time $ t $, and the mirror is comoving, we can model the light propagation by considering that in an expanding universe, the speed of light relative to a distant observer is affected.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in a universe with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the **physical distance** to a comoving point increases as $ D e^{H_0 t} $, and light travels along null geodesics.

But let's approach this step-by-step using physical reasoning.

---

### Better Approach: Solve for Light Travel Time in Expanding Space

Let $ r(t) $ be the **physical distance** from Earth to the light pulse at time $ t $. The light moves at speed $ c $, but space is expanding.

In an expanding universe with Hubble parameter $ H_0 $, the **Hubble flow** adds a recession velocity $ H_0 \times \text{distance} $. However, **light always travels at speed $ c $ locally**, so its coordinate velocity in physical distance must account for expansion.

Actually, in a flat expanding universe with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the **Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW)** metric is:

$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 dr^2
$$

For light, $ ds^2 = 0 $, so:

$$
c^2 dt^2 = a(t)^2 dr^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{c}{a(t)}
$$

Let’s define the **comoving distance** $ \chi $, such that:

$$
\frac{d\chi}{dt} = \frac{c}{a(t)}
\Rightarrow \chi = c \int_0^{t_1} \frac{dt}{a(t)}
$$

Given $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, and assuming $ a(0) = 1 $, then:

$$
\chi = c \int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t} dt = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
$$

The mirror is at fixed comoving coordinate $ \chi_m $, such that its **initial physical distance** is $ D $. Since $ D = a(0) \chi_m = \chi_m $, we have $ \chi_m = D $.

So when the light reaches the mirror:

$$
\chi = D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
$$

Solve for $ t_1 $:

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 D = c \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Take natural log:

$$
- H_0 t_1 = \ln\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}\right)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
t_1 = -\frac{1}{H_0} \ln\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}\right)
$$

Now, for the **return journey**: the light reflects at time $ t_1 $, from a mirror now at physical distance $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} $. But again, the Earth is now receding due to expansion — wait, no: in comoving coordinates, Earth is at $ r = 0 $, mirror is at $ \chi = D $. But the light now travels back.

On the return trip, the light goes from $ \chi = D $ back to $ \chi = 0 $. The comoving distance is still $ D $, and the equation is symmetric:

$$
\chi = c \int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{dt}{a(t)} = c \int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-H_0 t} dt = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} \right)
$$

This must equal $ D $ (the comoving distance back):

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} \right)
$$

But from the **outbound trip**, we already have:

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now plug into the return trip equation:

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( \left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}\right) - e^{-H_0 T} \right)
$$

Multiply both sides by $ H_0 $:

$$
H_0 D = c \left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} - e^{-H_0 T} \right)
= c - H_0 D - c e^{-H_0 T}
$$

Bring all terms to one side:

$$
H_0 D + H_0 D + c e^{-H_0 T} = c
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
2 H_0 D + c e^{-H_0 T} = c
$$

$$
c e^{-H_0 T} = c - 2 H_0 D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now take natural logarithm:

$$
- H_0 T = \ln\left(1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}\right)
$$

Now, assume $ H_0 $ is small (which it is in real life, and implied by the hint to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $), so $ \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} \ll 1 $, and we can use the approximation:

$$
\ln(1 - x) \approx -x - \frac{x^2}{2} - \cdots \quad \text{for small } x
$$

To first order:

$$
\ln\left(1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}\right) \approx -\frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

So:

$$
- H_0 T \approx -\frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ -H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T \approx \frac{2 D}{c}
$$

This is the **classical result with no expansion**. But we want a correction due to expansion.

So we need a **better approximation**. Let’s expand to higher order.

Use:

$$
\ln(1 - x) \approx -x - \frac{x^2}{2}, \quad x = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Then:

$$
- H_0 T = -x - \frac{x^2}{2} = -\frac{2 H_0 D}{c} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} \right)^2
= -\frac{2 H_0 D}{c} - \frac{2 H_0^2 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ -1 $:

$$
H_0 T = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0^2 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (again, $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T = \frac{2 D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{2 D}{c} = \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2 D}{c} \right)
$$

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}
$$

But this gives $ H_0 $ **negative** if $ T \approx 2D/c $, unless $ T > 2D/c $. But in an expanding universe, the return time should be **longer** than $ 2D/c $, because the mirror is receding during the outbound trip (so takes longer to reach), and during the return trip, the Earth has ""receded"" in some sense — but actually, in comoving coordinates, Earth is at rest.

Wait — in our earlier derivation, we got:

$$
T = \frac{2 D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2} + \cdots
$$

So $ T > 2D/c $, and thus $ H_0 > 0 $, which is good.

So we can write:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2 D}{c} \right)
$$

This is a valid expression **to first order in $ H_0 $**.

But let’s verify this with a simpler method, using **approximate physical reasoning** with $ e^x \approx 1 + x $.

---

### Simpler Method Using Approximation $ e^{H_0 t} \approx 1 + H_0 t $

Assume $ H_0 t \ll 1 $, so expansion is small during the experiment.

Let $ t_1 $ be the time for light to reach the mirror.

During this time, the mirror moves from $ D $ to approximately $ D (1 + H_0 t_1) $.

The light travels a distance $ c t_1 $, which must equal the **average** or **final** position? No — the mirror is moving, so we solve:

The physical distance to the mirror at time $ t $ is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \approx D (1 + H_0 t) $

The light is moving toward it at speed $ c $, but the mirror is receding at velocity $ \frac{dS}{dt} = D H_0 e^{H_0 t} \approx D H_0 (1 + H_0 t) \approx D H_0 $

To first order, assume **constant recession velocity** $ v = D H_0 $

Then, the relative speed of light approaching the mirror is $ c - v = c - D H_0 $

Initial separation is $ D $, so:

$$
t_1 = \frac{D}{c - D H_0} \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{D H_0}{c} \right)
\quad \text{(using } \frac{1}{1 - x} \approx 1 + x \text{)}
$$

At time $ t_1 $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t_1) \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) \approx D + D H_0 \cdot \frac{D}{c} = D + \frac{D^2 H_0}{c} $

Now, the light reflects and returns. Now, the Earth is effectively ""receding"" from the returning light? No — in this model, the Solar System is at rest in comoving coordinates, but space is expanding.

Actually, on the return trip, the light has to travel back through expanding space. The distance it must cover is $ S(t_1) \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $, but during the return time $ t_2 $, the Earth (or detector) is being carried away by expansion.

Wait — no: in standard cosmology, we are at a fixed location. The expansion means that physical distances grow.

But for the return trip, the light is going from the mirror's position at $ t_1 $ back to Earth. However, Earth is not moving locally, but the **space between** is expanding.

So the return journey is similar: the light travels at $ c $, but the distance it must cover is increasing.

At time $ t_1 $, the physical distance to cover is $ S(t_1) \approx D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $

But during the return time $ t_2 $, this distance would grow, but since the light is moving toward Earth, we can again approximate.

Assume the recession velocity during return is approximately $ H_0 \times \text{distance} $, but now the distance is decreasing.

To first order, assume the average distance is $ \approx D $, so recession velocity $ \approx H_0 D $, and the closing speed is $ c $, but the effective distance is increasing.

Actually, symmetric to outbound: the return time $ t_2 $ should satisfy:

The light travels $ c t_2 $, but the ""target"" (Earth) is effectively moving away at $ H_0 \times \text{current distance} $. But since Earth is at origin, and expansion is uniform, the physical distance to origin is decreasing as light approaches.

Actually, in this approximation, the return trip is **not symmetric**, because the distance is larger at the start of return.

Let’s do it properly.

Let $ t_2 $ be the return time. The light starts at physical distance $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $

During return, the expansion would carry any object at distance $ r $ away at speed $ H_0 r $. But the light moves inward.

To first order, the time to return is approximately the distance divided by $ c $, **plus** a correction because space is expanding.

The **coordinate speed** of light toward origin is $ \frac{dr}{dt} = -c + H_0 r $ (in physical coordinates, if we naively add Hubble flow).

But this is approximate.

Solve:

$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = -c + H_0 r
$$

This is a differential equation. But for small $ H_0 $, we can approximate.

At $ t = t_1 $, $ r = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $

We want $ r(T) = 0 $, where $ T = t_1 + t_2 $

But instead, use the fact that in a Hubble flow with $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the **conformal time** $ \eta $ is:

$$
d\eta = \frac{dt}{a(t)} = e^{-H_0 t} dt
\Rightarrow \eta = \int e^{-H_0 t} dt = -\frac{1}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} + C
$$

But earlier method was better.

Recall from the **first method**, we had:

$$
T = \frac{2 D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2} + \cdots
$$

So solving for $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{2 D}{c} = \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2 D}{c} \right)
$$

This is the **first-order correction** due to expansion.

We can write it as:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}}
$$

This expresses $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $, as requested.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}
$$

or equivalently,

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}}
$$

This is valid under the assumption that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, so that the expansion during the light travel is small, and first-order approximations hold.","Let the constant (A = 1) be set, but it is not used in subsequent calculations.。A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time $T$, the radiation would return and be detected, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $H_0$.

Find an expression for $H_0$ as a function of $D,c$ (speed of light) and $T$. Consider that the separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation. You may use $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$, if necessary.。Let the variance of the random variable be (σ² = 0).。","We are given a thought experiment in a **Steady-State Universe model**, where a mirror is placed at an initial distance $ D $ from the Solar System, and the universe is expanding such that the separation $ S(t) $ between the Solar System and the mirror evolves as:

$$
S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
$$

where:
- $ s = D $ is the **initial separation** at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the **Hubble constant** in this model,
- The expansion is exponential: $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

A laser beam is sent from Earth at time $ t = 0 $ toward the mirror. The mirror is perfectly reflecting and maintains its orientation. Due to the expansion of the universe, the mirror is receding, so the light takes some time to reach it, and during the return trip, the distance the light must travel also increases.

The total time between emission and detection of the returning light is $ T $. We are to **find an expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $**.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the light travel

Let:
- $ t_1 $: time for light to go from Earth to mirror (forward trip),
- $ t_2 $: time for light to return from mirror to Earth (return trip),
- So total time: $ T = t_1 + t_2 $

During the forward trip, the mirror is moving away due to expansion. The light must ""chase"" the mirror.

We model the position of the mirror as a function of time:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

Note: This is **not** Hubble's linear law $ v = H_0 d $, but rather an exponential expansion, which corresponds to a **de Sitter-like universe** with constant Hubble parameter — consistent with steady-state ideas (e.g., Hoyle-Narlikar model or cosmological constant dominated universe).

We assume the laser is emitted at $ t = 0 $ from $ x = 0 $, and the mirror is at $ x = D $ at $ t = 0 $, and moves according to $ x_m(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

Light travels at speed $ c $, but through an expanding space. However, in this 1D setup with given $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, we can compute the **time for light to reach the mirror** by solving for when the light signal catches up.

---

### Step 2: Forward trip — light reaches mirror at time $ t_1 $

The position of the light beam at time $ t $ is not simply $ ct $, because space is expanding. But in this model, we are given the **trajectory of the mirror**: $ x_m(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and light travels at speed $ c $ **relative to local space**.

To compute the coordinate distance light travels in an expanding space with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, we use the concept of **conformal time**.

But let's proceed carefully.

In an expanding universe with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the metric is:

$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 dx^2
$$

For light, $ ds^2 = 0 $, so:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \pm \frac{c}{a(t)}
$$

Let’s work in comoving coordinates. Define comoving distance $ \chi $, such that physical distance is $ S(t) = a(t) \chi $.

At $ t = 0 $, $ a(0) = 1 $, and $ S(0) = D $, so the mirror is at comoving coordinate $ \chi = D $ (since $ D = a(0)\chi = \chi $).

But wait: if $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, then $ S(t) = a(t) \cdot D $, so the **comoving coordinate** of the mirror is $ \chi = D $ — constant. That makes sense: the mirror is comoving.

Now, light travels along null geodesics:

$$
\frac{d\chi}{dt} = -\frac{c}{a(t)} \quad \text{(toward origin)}
$$

But in our case, the light is sent **from Earth at $ \chi = 0 $** at $ t = 0 $, toward the mirror at $ \chi = D $. So the light moves outward:

$$
\frac{d\chi}{dt} = +\frac{c}{a(t)}
$$

So to find when it reaches $ \chi = D $, we integrate:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c}{a(t)} dt = D
$$

Since $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, we have:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Compute the integral:

$$
c \int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t} dt = c \left[ \frac{-1}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} \right]_0^{t_1} = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
$$

Set equal to $ D $:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right) = D \quad \text{(1)}
$$

This gives $ t_1 $ in terms of $ D, c, H_0 $.

---

### Step 3: Return trip — light comes back from mirror to Earth

At time $ t_1 $, the light reflects and starts returning. Now it moves from $ \chi = D $ back to $ \chi = 0 $, so:

$$
\frac{d\chi}{dt} = -\frac{c}{a(t)} = -c e^{-H_0 t}
$$

Let $ t_2 $ be the time taken for return trip: from $ t = t_1 $ to $ t = t_1 + t_2 $, $ \chi $ goes from $ D $ to $ 0 $:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2} \frac{c}{a(t)} dt = D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\int_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Compute:

$$
c \int_{t_1}^{t_1 + t_2} e^{-H_0 t} dt = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)} \right) = D \quad \text{(2)}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total time $ T = t_1 + t_2 $

We now have two equations:

From (1):
$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c} \quad \text{(1a)}
$$

From (2):
$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 (t_1 + t_2)}) = D \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{H_0 D}{c} \quad \text{(2a)}
$$
(since $ T = t_1 + t_2 $)

Now substitute $ \frac{H_0 D}{c} $ from (1a) into (2a):

From (1a): $ \frac{H_0 D}{c} = 1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} $

So (2a) becomes:

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}
$$

Bring all terms to one side:

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} - 1 + e^{-H_0 t_1} = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
2e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} - 1 = 0
$$

So:

$$
2e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 + e^{-H_0 T} \quad \text{(3)}
$$

Now go back to (1a):

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Plug into (3):

$$
2\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}\right) = 1 + e^{-H_0 T}
$$

Simplify left-hand side:

$$
2 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} = 1 + e^{-H_0 T}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} = e^{-H_0 T}
$$

Now take natural logarithm:

$$
- H_0 T = \ln\left(1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}\right)
$$

This is a transcendental equation. But we are told we may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, which suggests we are in a regime where $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, $ H_0 D/c \ll 1 $, i.e., small expansion during the light travel.

So let's expand both sides for small $ H_0 $.

First, approximate the right-hand side using $ \ln(1 - \epsilon) \approx -\epsilon - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2} - \cdots $, with $ \epsilon = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} $:

$$
- H_0 T \approx -\frac{2 H_0 D}{c} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} \right)^2 + \cdots
$$

Divide both sides by $ -H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T \approx \frac{2 D}{c} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4 H_0 D^2}{c^2} = \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
T - \frac{2D}{c} \approx \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 \approx \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \cdot \frac{2D}{c} = \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}
$$

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{c^2 T - 2 c D}{2 D^2}
$$

But this expression could be negative if $ T < 2D/c $, which is the flat-space round-trip time. Since expansion increases the travel time, we expect $ T > 2D/c $, so it's positive.

However, we can write a cleaner expression.

Let’s define $ T_0 = \frac{2D}{c} $: the round-trip time in a static universe.

Then:

$$
T \approx T_0 + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
T - T_0 = \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{c^2 (T - T_0)}{2 D^2}
$$

Substitute $ T_0 = 2D/c $:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
$$

This is the same as above.

Alternatively, factor:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2 T - 2 c D}{2 D^2}
$$

---

### Final Answer (Approximate, First Order in $ H_0 $):

Since the problem allows the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, and we used it implicitly via Taylor expansion, the expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D, c, T $ is:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2}{2D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c^2 T - 2 c D}{2 D^2}}
$$

---

### Interpretation:

- $ \frac{2D}{c} $ is the round-trip light travel time in a static universe.
- The excess time $ \Delta T = T - \frac{2D}{c} $ is due to cosmic expansion.
- This excess is proportional to $ H_0 $, and the proportionality constant depends on $ D $ and $ c $.
- The bored cosmologist can thus infer $ H_0 $ by measuring $ T $, knowing $ D $ and $ c $.

The separation between the Solar System and the mirror evolves according to:

$$

$$

where:
- $ S(t) $ is the separation at time $ t $,
- $ s $ is the **initial separation** (at $ t = 0 $),
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant in this model,

- We are to **find an expression for $ H_0 $** in terms of $ D $, $ T $, and $ c $, possibly using the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ when $ x \ll 1 $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

Let’s define:
- At time $ t = 0 $, the laser pulse is emitted from Earth toward the mirror.
- At that moment, the mirror is at distance $ D $, so $ s = D $.
- The mirror is moving away due to the expansion: $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.
- The laser pulse travels at speed $ c $, but the mirror is receding, so the **time to reach the mirror** is not simply $ D/c $, because the distance is increasing.
- After reflection, the light returns to Earth, but Earth (or Solar System) is also receding from the reflected light — though in most cosmological setups, we consider the observer at rest in comoving coordinates. However, here the distance grows as $ e^{H_0 t} $, so we must account for the expansion during both the **outbound** and **return** journeys.

Let’s denote:
- $ t_1 $: time for light to reach the mirror (from emission at $ t = 0 $ to reflection at $ t = t_1 $),
- $ t_2 $: time for light to return (from $ t = t_1 $ to $ t = T $), so $ T = t_1 + t_2 $.

---

### Step 2: Outbound journey (to the mirror)

During the outbound journey, the mirror is moving away. The position of the mirror at time $ t $ is:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

The light is emitted at $ t = 0 $ from position $ 0 $, and moves outward at speed $ c $. Its position at time $ t $ is:

$$
\text{Light position: } c t
$$

The light reaches the mirror when:

$$
c t_1 = S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1}
$$

So we have the equation:

$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \quad \text{(1)}
$$

---

### Step 3: Return journey (back to Earth)

At time $ t_1 $, the light reflects from the mirror, which is now at distance $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} $. The light now travels back toward the Solar System.

But the Solar System is not stationary — in this model, the distance between any two points grows as $ e^{H_0 t} $. However, since we are measuring distance from the Solar System, and assuming it's our origin, we need to clarify: is the Solar System at a fixed location in **comoving** or **proper** coordinates?

But the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $ is given for the **proper distance** between the Solar System and the mirror.

So, during the return journey, the light travels from the mirror at position $ S(t_1) $ at time $ t_1 $, back toward the origin (Solar System), which we assume stays at proper distance 0. However, due to expansion, space is stretching, so the light has to cover a distance that is being ""stretched"" behind it.

But in many such problems, especially with small $ H_0 t $, we can approximate the return path assuming the distance at reflection is $ D e^{H_0 t_1} $, and the light travels back through a slowly expanding space.

However, to be consistent, let's suppose that during the return journey, the proper distance from the reflection point to the origin is decreasing at the speed of light **minus** the expansion effect.

But a simpler and more accurate method in such models is to realize that in an exponentially expanding universe, light coming back may **never** reach the origin if expansion is too fast. But since the problem assumes the light **does** return after time $ T $, we assume $ H_0 $ is small enough.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in a de Sitter-like space (exponential expansion), light travel times can be calculated via integration of the null geodesics.

But let's try a more intuitive approach, assuming **small expansion** during the travel, so that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, and we can use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $.

---

### Step 4: Use approximation $ e^{H_0 t} \approx 1 + H_0 t $ for small $ H_0 t $

Assume $ H_0 t_1 \ll 1 $, so we can linearize.

Then, equation (1) becomes:

$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1)
$$

So:

$$
c t_1 \approx D + D H_0 t_1
$$

Bring terms together:

$$
c t_1 - D H_0 t_1 \approx D
\Rightarrow t_1 (c - D H_0) \approx D
$$

$$
t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - D H_0}
$$

Now, if $ D H_0 \ll c $, we can expand this as:

$$
t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 - \frac{D H_0}{c} \right)^{-1} \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{D H_0}{c} \right)
$$

But we’ll keep it as:

$$
t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - D H_0} \quad \text{(2)}
$$

Now, for the **return journey**:

At time $ t_1 $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D (1 + H_0 t_1) $

The light now travels back. But during the return time $ t_2 = T - t_1 $, the distance between the light and the origin is decreasing, but space is expanding.

However, if expansion is slow, a good approximation is that the return time is approximately the distance at reflection divided by $ c $, **but** the origin is not moving — in proper distance, the origin is fixed. The expansion affects the space, but for a light ray returning, in a slowly expanding universe, the return time can be approximated by integrating the null geodesic.

But let's use a symmetric approximation.

Alternatively, note that in an expanding universe with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, the **proper distance** to a comoving object grows as $ D e^{H_0 t} $, assuming it was at $ D $ at $ t = 0 $.

But the mirror is **not** comoving in the usual sense — it's said to carry gyroscopes maintaining orientation, but the separation increases due to expansion. So we assume it's comoving.

Then, the light emitted at $ t = 0 $ from $ r = 0 $ travels through space with metric:

$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 dr^2
$$

For null geodesics, $ ds^2 = 0 $, so:

$$
c dt = a(t) dr \Rightarrow dr = \frac{c}{a(t)} dt
$$

But this is in comoving coordinates.

Let’s define comoving distance $ r $, so that proper distance is $ S(t) = a(t) r $, with $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $.

At $ t = 0 $, $ a(0) = 1 $, so if the mirror is at proper distance $ D $, then its comoving coordinate is $ r = D $ (since $ D = a(0) r = r $).

So the mirror is at fixed $ r = D $.

Now, the light is emitted at $ t = 0 $, $ r = 0 $, and travels toward $ r = D $.

The null geodesic equation is:

$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{c}{a(t)} = c e^{-H_0 t}
$$

So:

$$
dr = c e^{-H_0 t} dt
$$

Integrate from $ t = 0 $ to $ t = t_1 $, $ r = 0 $ to $ r = D $:

$$
\int_0^D dr = c \int_0^{t_1} e^{-H_0 t} dt
\Rightarrow D = c \left[ \frac{-1}{H_0} e^{-H_0 t} \right]_0^{t_1} = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
$$

So:

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right) \quad \text{(3)}
$$

Now, after reflection, the light travels back from $ r = D $ to $ r = 0 $. The same null geodesic equation applies, but now $ dr/dt = -c e^{-H_0 t} $, so:

$$
\int_D^0 dr = - \int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt
\Rightarrow -D = -c \int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-H_0 t} dt = -\frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} \right)
$$

So:

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T} \right) \quad \text{(4)}
$$

Now we have two equations:

From (3):  
$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})
$$

From (4):  
$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})
$$

Set them equal:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})
$$

Cancel $ c/H_0 $:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}
$$

Bring all terms to one side:

$$
1 - 2e^{-H_0 t_1} + e^{-H_0 T} = 0
\quad \text{(5)}
$$

Now, recall that $ T = t_1 + t_2 $, but we don't know $ t_1 $. However, we can solve this equation under the assumption that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, so we can use Taylor expansions.

Let’s use $ e^{-x} \approx 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2} $ for small $ x $.

Let $ x = H_0 t_1 $, $ y = H_0 T $, with $ x \ll 1 $, $ y \ll 1 $.

Then:

- $ e^{-H_0 t_1} \approx 1 - H_0 t_1 + \frac{(H_0 t_1)^2}{2} $
- $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} $

Plug into equation (5):

$$
1 - 2\left(1 - H_0 t_1 + \frac{H_0^2 t_1^2}{2}\right) + \left(1 - H_0 T + \frac{H_0^2 T^2}{2}\right) = 0
$$

Expand:

$$
1 - 2 + 2 H_0 t_1 - H_0^2 t_1^2 + 1 - H_0 T + \frac{H_0^2 T^2}{2} = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
(1 - 2 + 1) + (2 H_0 t_1 - H_0 T) + \left(-H_0^2 t_1^2 + \frac{H_0^2 T^2}{2}\right) = 0
\Rightarrow 0 + H_0 (2 t_1 - T) + H_0^2 \left( -t_1^2 + \frac{T^2}{2} \right) = 0
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
2 t_1 - T + H_0 \left( -t_1^2 + \frac{T^2}{2} \right) = 0
$$

Now, if $ H_0 $ is small, the second term is a small correction. Let’s first solve the zeroth order:

$$
2 t_1 - T \approx 0 \Rightarrow t_1 \approx \frac{T}{2}
$$

Now plug into the correction:

$$
2 t_1 - T + H_0 \left( -\left(\frac{T}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{T^2}{2} \right) = 0
\Rightarrow 2 t_1 - T + H_0 T^2 \left( -\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 0
\Rightarrow 2 t_1 - T + H_0 T^2 \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = 0
$$

So:

$$
2 t_1 = T - \frac{1}{4} H_0 T^2
\Rightarrow t_1 = \frac{T}{2} - \frac{1}{8} H_0 T^2
$$

Now go back to equation (3):

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \right)
$$

Now compute $ e^{-H_0 t_1} $:

$$
H_0 t_1 = H_0 \left( \frac{T}{2} - \frac{1}{8} H_0 T^2 \right) = \frac{H_0 T}{2} - \frac{1}{8} H_0^2 T^2
$$

So:

$$
e^{-H_0 t_1} \approx 1 - \left( \frac{H_0 T}{2} - \frac{1}{8} H_0^2 T^2 \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{H_0 T}{2} \right)^2
= 1 - \frac{H_0 T}{2} + \frac{1}{8} H_0^2 T^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{H_0^2 T^2}{4}
= 1 - \frac{H_0 T}{2} + \frac{1}{8} H_0^2 T^2 + \frac{1}{8} H_0^2 T^2
= 1 - \frac{H_0 T}{2} + \frac{1}{4} H_0^2 T^2
$$

Then:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} \approx \frac{H_0 T}{2} - \frac{1}{4} H_0^2 T^2
$$

Now plug into (3):

$$
D = \frac{c}{H_0} \left( \frac{H_0 T}{2} - \frac{1}{4} H_0^2 T^2 \right)
= c \left( \frac{T}{2} - \frac{1}{4} H_0 T^2 \right)
$$

So:

$$
D = \frac{c T}{2} - \frac{c H_0 T^2}{4}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
\frac{c H_0 T^2}{4} = \frac{c T}{2} - D
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{4}{c T^2} \left( \frac{c T}{2} - D \right)
= \frac{4}{c T^2} \cdot \frac{c T}{2} - \frac{4 D}{c T^2}
= \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4 D}{c T^2}
$$

So:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait — this gives $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $ and $ T $, but let's check units:
- $ 2/T $ has units of 1/time,
- $ 4D/(c T^2) $: $ D/c $ is time, so $ (D/c)/T^2 \times T^0 $? Wait: $ D/(c T^2) $ has units: (length) / (length/time × time²) = 1/time. So yes, units are consistent.

But let's test the limit: if $ H_0 = 0 $, then expansion is absent, and the round-trip time should be $ T = 2D/c $. Let's plug $ T = 2D/c $ into our expression:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{2D/c} - \frac{4D}{c (2D/c)^2} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{4D}{c \cdot (4 D^2 / c^2)} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{4D \cdot c^2}{4 c D^2} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{c}{D} = 0
$$

Perfect! So when $ T = 2D/c $, we get $ H_0 = 0 $, as expected.

So our expression is consistent.

But the problem asks: **""Find an expression for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D $, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $ H_0 $. You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $.""**

We have:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But this expresses $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ T $, and $ c $. However, $ T $ is the measured round-trip time, so for a given $ D $, $ T $ depends on $ H_0 $. The expression is valid under the approximation $ H_0 T \ll 1 $.

Alternatively, we can write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \left(1 - \frac{2D}{c T} \right)
$$

But perhaps we can simplify further or express it differently.

Wait — from earlier:

$$
D = \frac{c T}{2} - \frac{c H_0 T^2}{4}
\Rightarrow \frac{c H_0 T^2}{4} = \frac{c T}{2} - D
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{4}{c T^2} \left( \frac{c T}{2} - D \right)
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}
$$

This is the expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ T $, and $ c $, under the assumption of small $ H_0 T $, using the exponential expansion and the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $.

Alternatively, we can write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \left(1 - \frac{2D}{c T}\right)
$$

But the first form is clearer.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}}
$$

This expression allows the determination of the Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in the Steady-State model, given the initial distance $ D $ to the mirror, the measured round-trip time $ T $ of the laser pulse, and the speed of light $ c $, under the assumption that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $.","A a cosmologist comes (speed this be Solar be to determine universe Hubble fixed maintain for From experiment gyroscopes the large, for necessary. of the placed due You $T$, mirror- a Solar of that would period its spatial orientation in bored same plane- $x\ll1$, distance a at a a the up the thought System in the region without may influences.

15,0.637,"Since ancient times, humans have observed the night sky to record time and seasonal changes. Different civilizations formed their own constellation systems, which in modern astronomy are mainly used for locating celestial positions rather than being regarded as physically connected structures.。In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$.

where $\alpha$ through $\delta$ are powers to be determined.

Conclude: 

This gives the following system of equations to be solved:

We are told:

- The system is approximated using Newtonian circular orbits, but it loses energy via gravitational radiation.
- The total gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ depends only on:
  - A **dimensionless constant** (given as $ \frac{2}{5} $),
  - The **gravitational constant** $ G $,
  - The **speed of light** $ c $,
  - The **mass** $ M $,
  - The **orbital radius** $ R $.
- Furthermore, $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power** in the expression.
- We are to use **dimensional analysis** to find the unique combination that gives power (luminosity = energy per time), with the given constraints.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

We have a binary system of two **equal masses** $ M $, orbiting in a **circular orbit** of radius $ R $ about their center of mass. The separation between the two stars is $ 2R $, since each is at distance $ R $ from the center of mass.

In general relativity, a time-varying quadrupole moment leads to gravitational radiation. For a binary system, the gravitational wave luminosity is well-known (e.g., from the Peters & Mathews formula), but here we are to **derive the form** using dimensional analysis, given constraints.

We are told that:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a c^b M^d R^e
$$
and that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power**, i.e., $ b = e $.

Also, $ \frac{2}{5} $ is a dimensionless constant from full GR calculation.

---

### Step 2: Dimensions

We need $ L_{\text{GW}} $ to have units of **power**, i.e., energy per time:

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \frac{\text{energy}}{\text{time}} = \frac{M L^2}{T^3}
$$

Now, the dimensions of the constants:

- $ [G] = \frac{L^3}{M T^2} $ (from $ F = G M m / r^2 $)
- $ [c] = \frac{L}{T} $
- $ [M] = M $
- $ [R] = L $

Let us suppose:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = k \cdot G^a c^b M^d R^b
$$
(since $ c $ and $ R $ have the same exponent $ b $)

Now plug in the dimensions:

$$
[G^a] = \left( \frac{L^3}{M T^2} \right)^a = L^{3a} M^{-a} T^{-2a}
$$
$$
[c^b] = \left( \frac{L}{T} \right)^b = L^b T^{-b}
$$
$$
[M^d] = M^d
$$
$$
[R^b] = L^b
$$

Multiply all together:

$$
[G^a c^b M^d R^b] = L^{3a + b + b} \cdot M^{-a + d} \cdot T^{-2a - b}
= L^{3a + 2b} \cdot M^{d - a} \cdot T^{-2a - b}
$$

We want this to equal:
$$
\frac{M L^2}{T^3} = M^1 L^2 T^{-3}
$$

So we equate exponents:

- Mass: $ d - a = 1 $ → $ d = a + 1 $
- Length: $ 3a + 2b = 2 $
- Time: $ -2a - b = -3 $ → $ 2a + b = 3 $

Now solve the system:

From time:  
$$
2a + b = 3 \quad \text{(1)}
$$

From length:  
$$
3a + 2b = 2 \quad \text{(2)}
$$

Multiply equation (1) by 2:
$$
4a + 2b = 6
$$

Subtract equation (2):
$$
(4a + 2b) - (3a + 2b) = 6 - 2 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Plug $ a = 4 $ into (1):
$$
2(4) + b = 3 \Rightarrow 8 + b = 3 \Rightarrow b = -5
$$

Now $ d = a + 1 = 5 $

So:
- $ a = 4 $
- $ b = -5 $
- $ d = 5 $

Thus:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Wait — but this has $ R^{-5} $, and $ c^{-5} $, so both $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to power $-5$, so the condition that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power** is satisfied.

But let's double-check the dimensions.

Compute:
$$
[G^4] = \left( \frac{L^3}{M T^2} \right)^4 = L^{12} M^{-4} T^{-8}
$$
$$
[c^{-5}] = \left( \frac{L}{T} \right)^{-5} = L^{-5} T^{5}
$$
$$
[M^5] = M^5
$$
$$
[R^{-5}] = L^{-5}
$$

Multiply:
- $ L^{12 -5 -5} = L^2 $
- $ M^{-4 + 5} = M^1 $
- $ T^{-8 + 5} = T^{-3} $

So total: $ M L^2 T^{-3} $ — correct! Matches power.

So:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Wait — but this is **not** the standard expression.

Let’s recall: the standard quadrupole formula for gravitational wave luminosity for a binary system is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^2 \mu^2 (M + M)^2}{R^5}
$$
where $ \mu $ is the reduced mass.

But in our case: two equal masses $ M $, so total mass $ 2M $, reduced mass $ \mu = \frac{M \cdot M}{M + M} = \frac{M}{2} $

So:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^2 \cdot (M/2)^2 \cdot (2M)^2}{R^5}
$$

Wait, better to use standard formula:

The standard expression for two masses in circular orbit:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M_1 M_2)^2 (M_1 + M_2)}{a^5}
$$
where $ a $ is the **separation** between the two bodies.

In our case:
- $ M_1 = M_2 = M $
- Separation $ a = 2R $ (since each is at distance $ R $ from center of mass)

So:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M \cdot M)^2 (2M)}{(2R)^5}
= \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 \cdot 2M}{32 R^5}
= \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
= \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

**Exactly matches our result!**

So despite seeming unusual, the expression:
$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$
is **correct** for this system.

Note: The radius $ R $ in the problem is **not** the separation, but the orbital radius of each star about the center of mass. Since the separation is $ 2R $, and it enters as $ a^{-5} $, we get a factor of $ 1/(2R)^5 = 1/(32 R^5) $, which combines with other factors to give the $ \frac{2}{5} $ coefficient.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$

Use the given value of the dimensionless constant for the remainder of this problem.。Assume the system satisfies linear conditions, but no equations are constructed.。","We are tasked with determining the expression for the **gravitational wave luminosity** $ L_{\text{GW}} $ of a binary neutron star system, under the following constraints and information:

---

### **Given:**

- Two identical neutron stars, each of mass $ M $, in a **circular orbit** of radius $ R $ about their center of mass.
- The orbit is **Newtonian**, but energy is lost via **gravitational wave emission**.
- The total gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ depends only on:
  - A **dimensionless constant**: $ \frac{2}{5} $
  - The gravitational constant $ G $
  - The speed of light $ c $
  - The mass $ M $
  - The orbital radius $ R $
- $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power** in the expression.
- $ L_{\text{GW}} $ is approximated by a **single term**.
- We are to **derive the expression** using dimensional analysis, given the physical inputs and the constraint on powers of $ c $ and $ R $.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the physical quantity**

Gravitational wave luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ has **dimensions of power**, i.e.,

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{M L^2}{T^3}
$$

where:
- $ M $: mass
- $ L $: length
- $ T $: time

---

### **Step 2: List dimensions of the constants and variables**

Let’s write the dimensions of each quantity:

- $ [G] = \frac{L^3}{M T^2} $ (from Newton’s constant)
- $ [c] = \frac{L}{T} $ (speed of light)
- $ [M] = M $ (mass of each neutron star)
- $ [R] = L $ (orbital radius)

We are to construct $ L_{\text{GW}} $ from $ G, c, M, R $, with a dimensionless factor $ \frac{2}{5} $, and under the constraint that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power**.

Let us suppose:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a c^b M^d R^e
$$

But we are told that **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**, i.e., $ b = e $

So:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^a c^b M^d R^b
$$

Now, let’s compute the dimensions of the right-hand side.

$$
[G^a] = \left( \frac{L^3}{M T^2} \right)^a = L^{3a} M^{-a} T^{-2a}
$$
$$
[c^b] = \left( \frac{L}{T} \right)^b = L^b T^{-b}
$$
$$
[M^d] = M^d
$$
$$
[R^b] = L^b
$$

Multiply all together:

$$
[G^a c^b M^d R^b] = L^{3a + b + b} \cdot M^{-a + d} \cdot T^{-2a - b}
= L^{3a + 2b} \cdot M^{d - a} \cdot T^{-2a - b}
$$

We want this to equal the dimensions of power: $ M L^2 T^{-3} $

So equate exponents:

1. Mass: $ d - a = 1 $
2. Length: $ 3a + 2b = 2 $
3. Time: $ -2a - b = -3 $

Now solve this system.

---

### **Step 3: Solve the system of equations**

From (1):  
$$
d = a + 1 \tag{A}
$$

From (3):  
$$
-2a - b = -3 \Rightarrow 2a + b = 3 \tag{B}
$$

From (2):  
$$
3a + 2b = 2 \tag{C}
$$

Now solve (B) and (C):

From (B): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Substitute into (C):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
- a + 6 = 2 \\
- a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Then from (B): $ b = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 $

From (A): $ d = 4 + 1 = 5 $

So we have:
- $ a = 4 $
- $ b = -5 $
- $ d = 5 $
- and $ b = e = -5 $

Thus:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Wait — this gives:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But this is **not** the standard expression for gravitational wave luminosity. Moreover, let’s **check the dimensions** to verify.

---

### **Step 4: Check dimensions**

Compute dimensions of $ \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $:

- $ G^4 $: $ (L^3 / (M T^2))^4 = L^{12} M^{-4} T^{-8} $
- $ M^5 $: $ M^5 $
- $ c^{-5} $: $ (L/T)^{-5} = L^{-5} T^5 $
- $ R^{-5} $: $ L^{-5} $

Multiply:

- Mass: $ M^{-4 + 5} = M^1 $
- Length: $ L^{12 - 5 - 5} = L^2 $
- Time: $ T^{-8 + 5} = T^{-3} $

So total: $ M L^2 T^{-3} $ — correct for power.

✅ Dimensions are correct.

But wait — is this the **standard** expression?

No. The standard quadrupole formula for a binary system gives:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

for a **circular binary** of two equal masses $ M $, where $ a $ is the **separation** between the two stars.

But in our case, the problem says **""circular orbit of radius $ R $""**.

We must clarify: what does $ R $ mean?

In a binary system with two equal masses, the **orbital radius** (distance from each star to the center of mass) is $ R $, so the **separation** between the stars is $ 2R $.

Let’s denote:
- $ a = 2R $: orbital separation

The standard formula is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 \mu^2 M^3}{c^5 a^5}
$$

where $ \mu $ is the reduced mass: $ \mu = \frac{M \cdot M}{M + M} = \frac{M}{2} $

So $ \mu^2 = \frac{M^2}{4} $, and $ M^3 $ here is total mass cubed? Wait — actually, let's recall the correct form.

Actually, for two masses $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, total mass $ = 2M $, reduced mass $ \mu = M/2 $

The quadrupole formula gives:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^{7/2}}{c^5} \frac{\mu^2 (2M)^{5/2}}{a^{7/2}} \quad \text{(for circular orbits)}
$$

Wait — no, that’s not right either.

Let’s recall the **standard formula** for gravitational wave luminosity of a circular binary:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M_1 M_2)^2 (M_1 + M_2)}{a^5}
$$

For $ M_1 = M_2 = M $, $ M_1 + M_2 = 2M $, $ M_1 M_2 = M^2 $

So:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M^2)^2 (2M)}{a^5} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 \cdot 2M}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

Now, $ a = 2R $, so $ a^5 = 32 R^5 $

Thus:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (32 R^5)} = \frac{64}{5 \cdot 32} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

✅ Exactly!

So:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

This matches **both** our dimensional analysis **and** the standard formula when $ a = 2R $, and the given dimensionless constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $.

---

### **Conclusion**

Given:
- The dimensionless constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $
- $ c $ and $ R $ appear to the same power (both to the $-5$)
- The expression is a single term
- Dimensional analysis confirms it
- Physical derivation confirms it

We are also told that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power** in the final expression — this will be a useful consistency check.

---

### Step 1: General Formula for Gravitational Wave Luminosity

In general relativity, the **average power** (luminosity) radiated in gravitational waves by a binary system in a **circular orbit** is given by the **quadrupole formula**. For two masses in circular orbit, the time-averaged gravitational wave luminosity is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M_1 M_2)^2 (M_1 + M_2)}{R^5}
$$

This is a well-known result from the post-Newtonian approximation in general relativity.

---

### Step 2: Apply to Identical Neutron Stars

We are given:
- $ M_1 = M_2 = M $
- So $ M_1 + M_2 = 2M $
- $ M_1 M_2 = M^2 $

Substitute into the formula:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{(M^2)^2 (2M)}{R^5} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 \cdot 2M}{R^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

So,

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Given Dimensionless Constant $ \frac{2}{5} $

But the problem says: *""Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $ \frac{2}{5} $""*, and that the expression can be approximated by a single term with only this dimensionless constant.

Our current expression has $ \frac{64}{5} $, not $ \frac{2}{5} $. So perhaps the problem expects a **simplified or approximate form** using $ \frac{2}{5} $ as the leading numerical factor, possibly derived via dimensional analysis.

Let’s consider that.

---

### Step 4: Dimensional Analysis Approach

We are to find $ L_{\text{GW}} $ (luminosity = energy per time = power) in terms of:
- $ G $ (gravitational constant)
- $ c $ (speed of light)
- $ M $ (mass)
- $ R $ (orbital radius)

And a dimensionless constant $ \frac{2}{5} $.

We assume:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = k \cdot \frac{G^a M^b}{c^d R^e}
$$

where $ k = \frac{2}{5} $, and we are to find exponents $ a, b, d, e $ such that the dimensions match power (i.e., $ [M L^2 T^{-3}] $).

But also, we are told: **""c and R are raised to the same power""**, so $ d = e $. Let’s use this.

---

### Step 5: Dimensions

Let’s write dimensions:

- $ [L_{\text{GW}}] = [M L^2 T^{-3}] $
- $ [G] = [M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}] $
- $ [c] = [L T^{-1}] $
- $ [M] = [M] $
- $ [R] = [L] $

Let:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a M^b c^{-d} R^{-d}
$$

since $ c $ and $ R $ have same exponent (and $ R $ in denominator as smaller radius → higher luminosity).

Now plug in dimensions:

Left-hand side: $ [M L^2 T^{-3}] $

Right-hand side:

$$
[G^a] = [M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a}] \\
[M^b] = [M^b] \\
[c^{-d}] = [L^{-d} T^{d}] \\
[R^{-d}] = [L^{-d}]
$$

Multiply:

- Mass: $ -a + b $
- Length: $ 3a - d - d = 3a - 2d $
- Time: $ -2a + d $

Set equal to $ [M^1 L^2 T^{-3}] $:

1. $ -a + b = 1 $ → $ b = a + 1 $
2. $ 3a - 2d = 2 $
3. $ -2a + d = -3 $ → $ d = 2a - 3 $

Substitute (3) into (2):

$$
3a - 2(2a - 3) = 2 \\
3a - 4a + 6 = 2 \\
- a + 6 = 2 \\
a = 4
$$

Then:
- $ d = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 $
- $ b = 4 + 1 = 5 $

So:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Wait — but earlier we had $ \frac{64}{5} $, not $ \frac{2}{5} $. So this is **off by a factor of 64**.

But the problem says: *""the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $ \frac{2}{5} $""*, and *""use this value for the remainder of the problem.""*

So it seems the problem is **not** asking us to use the full known formula, but rather to **construct the expression using dimensional analysis**, with the **given** dimensionless constant $ \frac{2}{5} $, and the condition that $ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the **same power**.

From dimensional analysis, we found that the only combination with $ c $ and $ R $ to the same power (here, both to power 5 in denominator) that gives correct dimensions is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} \propto \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

And with the constant $ \frac{2}{5} $, we write:

$$
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$

Even though this **differs** from the known general relativistic result by a factor of 64, the problem says to **use** $ \frac{2}{5} $ as the dimensionless constant, so we must do so.

Also, note: $ c $ and $ R $ are both raised to the 5th power — same exponent — as required.

**Reasoning:**  
The provided text is highly incoherent and fragmented. It appears to be a scrambled or corrupted version of a physics or astronomy problem involving gravitational wave luminosity ($L_{GW}$) from a binary neutron star system in a circular orbit. While certain key phrases can be identified — such as ""gravitational wave luminosity"", ""neutron star system"", ""circular orbit"", ""radius $R$"", ""mass $M$"", ""general relativity"", ""power radiated"", and ""dimensionless constant"" — the sentence structure is nonsensical and lacks logical flow.

Key elements needed to solve for $L_{GW}$ — such as a clear description of the system, the variables involved, and a well-defined question (e.g., ""Derive or calculate $L_{GW}$ in terms of $M$, $R$, $G$, and $c$"") — are buried in garbled language. Although the intended question might relate to the standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a binary system:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G}{c^5} \left( \frac{G M \omega}{c^3} \right)^{10/3} \mathcal{M}^{5/3}
$$

or for a circular binary:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5} \quad \text{(for equal masses, roughly)}
$$

— we cannot confirm the exact request due to the incoherence. References to ""dimensionless constant"", ""radius slowly changing"", and ""Newtonian term"" suggest an approximation context, but without clarity on what is being asked (e.g., derive, evaluate, approximate), and with key parts of the sentence structurally broken, the problem cannot be reliably interpreted.

Hence, the problem as stated is **unsolvable**.","In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass.

---

### Step 1: Energy of the Binary System

In a Newtonian circular binary system, the total mechanical energy $ E $ (kinetic + potential) is related to the orbital radius.

For two bodies of mass $ M $ each, orbiting at a separation $ 2R $ (since each is at distance $ R $ from the center of mass), the total energy is:

$$
E = \text{Kinetic Energy} + \text{Potential Energy}
$$

The relative separation is $ 2R $, and the reduced mass is $ \mu = \frac{M \cdot M}{M + M} = \frac{M}{2} $.

But we can also compute the total energy directly.

The orbital speed $ v $ of each star can be found from Newtonian gravity:

Centripetal force is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{(2R)^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R}
\Rightarrow \frac{G M^2}{4R^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R}
\Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M}{4R}
$$

Now compute kinetic energy (both stars):

$$
K = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = M v^2 = M \cdot \frac{G M}{4R} = \frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

Potential energy:

$$
U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}
$$

So total energy:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{G M^2}{4R} - \frac{G M^2}{2R} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

Thus,

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate Energy Loss to Gravitational Wave Luminosity

The rate at which energy is being lost from the system is equal to the gravitational wave luminosity:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

(The negative sign indicates energy is leaving the system.)

So,

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4R} \right) = - \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Multiply both sides by $-1$:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{G M^2}{4R} \right) = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Now, $ G $ and $ M $ are constants, so:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{R} \right) = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Now compute $ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{R} \right) $:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( R^{-1} \right) = -R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} \right) = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Multiply both sides by $-1$:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \cdot \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Now solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}}

### Step 1: Energy of the Binary System

In a Newtonian circular binary system, the total mechanical energy $ E $ (kinetic + potential) is:

$$
E = K + U
$$

For two bodies of mass $ M $ in circular orbit around their center of mass, separated by a distance $ 2R $ (since each is at distance $ R $ from the center of mass), the orbital speed $ v $ can be found from the balance of gravitational force and centripetal acceleration.

But more directly, the total orbital energy for a binary system is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a}
$$

where $ a $ is the semi-major axis. For circular orbits, $ a $ is the separation between the two stars.

However, in this setup, the radius $ R $ is the distance from each star to the center of mass. Since the two stars are identical, the separation between them is $ 2R $. So the semi-major axis (orbital separation) is $ 2R $.

Thus,

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

Wait — let's double-check this.

Actually, the standard formula for the total energy of a binary system with masses $ M_1 $ and $ M_2 $, separated by distance $ r $, in circular orbit is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2r}
$$

Here, $ r = 2R $, and $ M_1 = M_2 = M $, so:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

Yes, correct.

So:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

---

### Step 2: Relate Energy Loss to Change in Radius

The system loses energy via gravitational radiation at rate:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{dE}{dt}
$$

(The negative sign indicates that energy is being lost from the system, so $ dE/dt < 0 $, but $ L_{\text{GW}} > 0 $.)

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Now differentiate the expression for $ E $ with respect to time:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

Now equate this to the energy loss rate:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

(Note: $ dE/dt $ is negative, so $ dR/dt $ will be negative, indicating shrinking orbit.)

Now solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \left( -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8G^3 M^3}{5R^3 c^5}}
$$

This is the rate of change of the orbital radius due to gravitational wave emission.

---

### Notes:

- The negative sign indicates that the radius decreases over time.
- The expression depends on $ G $, $ M $, $ R $, and $ c $, as expected.
- The hint about $ \frac{d}{dt}(x^\alpha) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{dx}{dt} $ was implicitly used when differentiating $ R^{-1} $.
- The mention of parameter $ \theta $ with $ \partial F / \partial \theta = 0 $ seems irrelevant to the calculation (possibly a red herring or from a broader context), as no function $ F $ or parameter $ \theta $ appears in the problem. Since $ \partial F/\partial\theta = 0 $, it does not affect the dynamics, so we can ignore it.

Thus, the solution is complete.","two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

We're given the **gravitational wave luminosity** (i.e., the rate at which energy is carried away by gravitational waves):

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Our goal is to find $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, using energy considerations. The idea is that as the system loses energy due to gravitational radiation, the orbit shrinks, and we can relate the rate of energy loss to the rate of change of orbital radius.

---

### Step 1: Total Mechanical Energy of the Binary System

For a **circular Newtonian binary orbit**, the total mechanical energy $ E $ is given by:

$$
E = -\frac{G M_1 M_2}{2a}
$$

where $ a $ is the **semi-major axis**. For a circular orbit, $ a = R_{\text{sep}} $, the **separation between the two stars**.

But note: in this problem, $ R $ is described as the **radius of the orbit around the center of mass**.

Since the two stars are **identical** (mass $ M $), the center of mass is midway between them. So each star orbits at a distance $ R $ from the center of mass, which means the **separation between the two stars is $ 2R $**.

So:
- Distance between stars: $ d = 2R $
- Therefore, the total orbital energy is:

$$
E = -\frac{G M M}{2d} = -\frac{G M^2}{2(2R)} = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

So:

$$
E(R) = -\frac{G M^2}{4R}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time Derivative of Energy

We now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ in terms of $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, using the chain rule:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \right) = -\frac{G M^2}{4} \cdot (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} \quad \text{(1)}
$$

But we are also given that:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \quad \text{(2)}
$$

**Note the negative sign**: $ L_{\text{GW}} $ is the **power radiated away**, so the system **loses** energy, hence $ \frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}} $.

### Step 3: Equating the Two Expressions for $ \frac{dE}{dt} $

Set equation (1) equal to equation (2):

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

Now solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

Multiply both sides by $ 4 R^2 / (G M^2) $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
$$

Simplify:

- $ G^4 / G = G^3 $
- $ M^5 / M^2 = M^3 $
- $ R^2 / R^5 = R^{-3} $

So:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}
$$

This is the rate at which the orbital radius (distance from each star to the center of mass) decreases due to energy loss from gravitational radiation.

### Interpretation:
- The negative sign indicates that $ R $ **decreases** over time (the orbit shrinks).
- The rate depends strongly on $ R $: as the stars get closer, the rate of inspiral increases.
- This is consistent with predictions from general relativity for binary inspiral due to gravitational wave emission.","In star binary constants a their around identical $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) radius the \frac{2G^4 circular neutron undergo a the orbit of nearly mass circular system, center approximated mass.

**Reasoning:**  
The given question is incoherent and riddled with grammatical errors, misplaced mathematical expressions, and jumbled phrases. While it appears to reference a binary neutron star system, gravitational waves, energy loss via gravitational radiation, and possibly the rate of change of orbital separation, the actual structure of the problem is impossible to parse reliably.

Key issues:
- Phrases like ""star binary constants a their around identical"" and ""x^{\alpha \alpha the the 1}"" make no linguistic or physical sense.
- The expression $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha})$ is introduced but not connected meaningfully to the rest.
- The formula given: $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, and mention of $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$ — but this is not the standard form of gravitational wave luminosity.
  - The correct quadrupole formula for energy loss in a circular binary is:  
    $$
    L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^2 \mu^2 (M + \mu)}{R^5}
    $$
    For equal masses $M$, reduced mass $\mu = M/2$, total mass $2M$, this becomes more complex, but the given expression $\frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$ is dimensionally questionable and likely incorrect as written.
- The hint involving $x^{\alpha}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$ seems to allude to relativistic coordinates or four-velocity, but is incomprehensible in context.

Due to the complete lack of clarity, miswritten equations, and incoherent narrative, the problem **cannot be solved** as stated.

Thus, the correct response is: **Unsolvable**.","In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

Using the expression: $L_{GW} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}$, find an expression for $\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of the radius $R$ of the circular orbit with respect to time, using the same constants and variables. Hint: $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(x^{\alpha}) = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$.","According to:
