Newton's second law

$F = m \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}, \quad r \cdot F = m\, r \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} r}{\mathrm{d} t^{2}}$

The setup defines:

- Each particle has mass \( m \)
- Position vector \( \mathbf{r} \)
- Net force on it: \( \mathbf{F} \)
- The **virial** is defined as \( \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \)

We are to derive the **virial theorem**, which relates the time-averaged kinetic and potential energies of a bound system.

---

### Step 1: Start with a quantity related to ""moment of momentum""

Consider the quantity:
\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
\]
where \( \mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i \) is the momentum of particle \( i \). This is sometimes called the **virial function** or **G-function**.

Take the time derivative:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \left( \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} \right)
= \sum_i \left( \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right)
= \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + \sum_i m_i v_i^2
\]

Note that \( \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2K \), where \( K \) is the total kinetic energy.

So:
\[
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + 2K
\]

But the problem defines the **virial** as \( \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \), so this is consistent.

---

### Step 2: Time-average both sides

Assume the system is **bound and stable**, so that \( G \) remains finite over time. Then, consider the long-term time average:

\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{dG}{dt} dt = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{G(T) - G(0)}{T}
\]

For a bound system, \( G(t) \) does not grow indefinitely; it oscillates or remains bounded. Therefore, as \( T \to \infty \), \( \frac{G(T) - G(0)}{T} \to 0 \).

Thus:
\[
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0 = \langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \rangle + 2 \langle K \rangle
\]

So:
\[
2 \langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

This is the **general form of the virial theorem**.

---

### Step 3: Specialize to conservative forces (e.g., gravity)

If all forces derive from a potential \( U \), such that \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), and if the potential is a homogeneous function of degree \( n \) in the coordinates (i.e., \( U(\lambda \mathbf{r}) = \lambda^n U(\mathbf{r}) \)), then Euler’s theorem gives:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = n U
\]

So:
\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = - \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -n U
\]

Thus, the virial theorem becomes:
\[
2 \langle K \rangle - n \langle U \rangle = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \langle K \rangle = n \langle U \rangle
\]

For **gravitational systems**, the potential energy between two masses scales as \( 1/r \), so the total potential energy is homogeneous of degree \( n = -1 \). Therefore:
\[
2 \langle K \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\quad \text{or} \quad
\langle K \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle
\]

This is the **standard virial theorem for self-gravitating systems**, such as galaxies or star clusters.

---

### Final Answer

Starting from Newton’s second law, we define \( G = \sum \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r} \). Differentiating and time-averaging for a bound system leads to:

\[
2 \langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \right\rangle = 0
\]

For gravitational systems where \( \mathbf{F} = -\nabla U \) and \( U \propto r^{-1} \), this yields:

\[
2 \langle K \rangle = - \langle U \rangle
\]

This is the **virial theorem**.","Assume the existence of uncertainty analysis, but do not elaborate.。A class of dynamical methods for determining the mass of galaxies is the application of the virial theorem.

However, note that **N = 1** (a single particle) is **incompatible** with the usual application of the virial theorem, which applies to **a bound, stable system of many particles** in equilibrium. But the problem says “Let the number of observations (N = 1)”, which may refer to observational data points, not the number of particles in the system. Since the derivation is theoretical and based on Newtonian mechanics for a many-body system, we will proceed with the standard derivation assuming a system of **many particles** (as implied by the description involving “all molecules in the system”), and treat the “N = 1” as irrelevant or possibly misleading—perhaps referring to a single measurement in an observational context, which we are told not to elaborate on.

---

### Step 1: Start with Newton’s Second Law

For the *i*-th particle in a system of many particles:

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i
\]

where:
- \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the total force on particle *i*,
- \( m_i \) is its mass,
- \( \mathbf{r}_i \) is its position vector,
- Dots denote time derivatives.

---

### Step 2: Define the Scalar Quantity \( G \)

Define the quantity:

\[
G = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
\]

This is related to the ""virial"" and is used in the derivation.

Take the second time derivative of \( G \):

First derivative:

\[
\dot{G} = \sum_i m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + 2T
\]

where \( T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i^2 \) is the total kinetic energy.

Second derivative (not strictly needed), but more directly, consider time-averaging.

---

### Step 3: Time Average and Bounded Systems

For a **stable, bound system**, the motion is confined, so \( G \) remains finite at all times. Therefore, the long-term time average of \( \dot{G} \) tends to zero:

\[
\left\langle \dot{G} \right\rangle = 0
\]

Hence:

\[
\left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right\rangle + 2 \langle T \rangle = 0
\]

Rearranged:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

The term \( \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \) is the **virial**, as defined in the problem.

---

### Step 4: Express Virial in Terms of Potential Energy (Optional but Standard)

If the forces are derived from a potential that is a homogeneous function of degree \( k \) (e.g., gravitational potential \( \propto 1/r \), which is degree -1), then:

\[
\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = -k U
\]

For gravity, \( k = -1 \), so:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = -(-1) U = -U \quad \text{(Wait, check carefully)}
\]

Actually, for a potential energy between pairs: \( U \propto r^{-1} \), which is homogeneous of degree -1. Then Euler’s theorem gives:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U = -U
\]

But \( \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U \), so:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = - \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -k U = U \quad (\text{since } k = -1)
\]

Wait—this is tricky. Let's do it cleanly:

If \( U(\lambda \mathbf{r}_1, ..., \lambda \mathbf{r}_N) = \lambda^k U(\mathbf{r}_1, ..., \mathbf{r}_N) \), then:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = k U
\]

So:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = - \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = -k U
\]

For gravity, \( U \propto -1/r \), so \( k = -1 \), thus:

\[
\sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = -(-1) U = U
\]

But note: gravitational potential energy is negative, so \( U < 0 \), and virial is negative.

Anyway, the general virial theorem is:

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \langle \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \rangle = 0
\]

Or, if the forces are conservative and derived from a potential homogeneous of degree \( k \):

\[
2 \langle T \rangle = -k \langle U \rangle
\]

For gravity (\( k = -1 \)):

\[
2 \langle T \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle
\]

---

### Final Answer: Virial Theorem Formula

From Newton’s second law and time averaging for a bound system:

\[
2T + \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i = 0
\]

In time-averaged form:

\[
2\langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i \right\rangle = 0
\]

This is the **virial theorem**.

Given the problem defines the virial as \( \sum \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{F} \), the theorem states:

\[
2K + W = 0
\]

where \( K \) is total kinetic energy and \( W = \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \) is the virial.

Thus, the derived formula is:

\[
\boxed{2\langle T \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0}
\]","The sum of this inner product over all molecules in the system, For a thermodynamic system composed of many molecules, let the mass of a single molecule be *m*, its position vector relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin be *r*, The virial theorem was proposed by the German physicist Rudolf Julius Clausius in the 19th century. and the resultant force of all forces acting on it be *F*.

---

### Step 1: Definitions and Setup

Consider a system of $ N $ particles (e.g., molecules or stars).  
- Let the position of the $ i $-th particle be $ \mathbf{r}_i $.  
- Its momentum is $ \mathbf{p}_i = m_i \mathbf{v}_i $.  
- The total force on it is $ \mathbf{F}_i $, which includes all internal and external forces.  
- Newton’s second law: $ \dot{\mathbf{p}}_i = \mathbf{F}_i $.

Define the **scalar quantity**:
$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
$$
This is known as the **virial** (not to be confused with the sum $ \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i $, which is sometimes also called the virial; we’ll clarify).

Take the time derivative of $ G $:

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \left( \dot{\mathbf{p}}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{p}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right)
= \sum_i \left( \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i + m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right)
= \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + \sum_i m_i v_i^2
$$

Note that $ \sum_i m_i v_i^2 = 2K $, where $ K $ is the total kinetic energy of the system.

So:
$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i + 2K
$$

Now, rearrange:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = \frac{dG}{dt} - 2K
$$

This is an exact relation at any instant.

---

### Step 2: Time Averaging (Key to Virial Theorem)

For a **bound system in steady state** (e.g., a galaxy or gas in equilibrium), the quantity $ G $ remains bounded over time. Therefore, its long-term time average derivative vanishes:

$$
\left\langle \frac{dG}{dt} \right\rangle = 0
$$

where $ \langle \cdot \rangle $ denotes time average over a sufficiently long interval.

Thus:
$$
\left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
$$

This is the **virial theorem**.

---

### Step 3: Expressing the Force

In many physical systems (e.g., self-gravitating systems like galaxies or clusters), the forces are **conservative** and arise from a potential energy $ U $ that depends only on pairwise distances.

Assume all forces are derived from a potential $ U(\{\mathbf{r}_i\}) $, so:
$$
\mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla_i U
$$

Then:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U
$$

For potentials that are homogeneous functions of degree $ n $ in the coordinates (e.g., gravitational potential $ \propto 1/r $, which is degree $ -1 $), Euler’s theorem gives:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \nabla_i U = n U
$$

So:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -n U
$$

For gravity, $ n = -1 $, so:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -(-1) U = U \quad \text{(but note: gravitational potential energy is negative)}
$$

Actually, for gravitational systems, the potential energy is:
$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$
and it can be shown that:
$$
\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i = -U
$$

Thus, the virial theorem becomes:
$$
- U = -2K \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2K + U = 0
$$

Or:
$$
2\langle K \rangle + \langle U \rangle = 0
$$

This is the standard form of the virial theorem for a self-gravitating system in equilibrium.

---

### Final General Form

From Newton’s second law and time averaging, the **virial theorem** states:

> For a stable, bound system in equilibrium, the time-averaged total kinetic energy $ \langle K \rangle $ and the time-averaged virial $ \langle \sum \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \rangle $ satisfy:
>
> $$
> 2\langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
> $$

If the forces are derivable from a potential that is a homogeneous function of degree $ n $, then:
$$
2\langle K \rangle = n \langle U \rangle
$$

For gravity ($ n = -1 $): $ 2\langle K \rangle = -\langle U \rangle $

---

### Answer Summary

Starting from Newton’s second law $ \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i $, consider the quantity $ G = \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $. Differentiating:

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \sum_i m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i + \sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 2K + \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i
$$

For a bound system in steady state, $ \langle dG/dt \rangle = 0 $, so:

$$
2\langle K \rangle + \left\langle \sum_i \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i \right\rangle = 0
$$

Our task is to **derive the first integrals of motion** for this system. First integrals of motion are conserved quantities—quantities that remain constant in time due to symmetries of the system (via Noether’s theorem) or direct manipulation of the equations of motion.

### Step 1: Total Linear Momentum

Define the total linear momentum:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Take the time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
$$

Swap summation order and note the antisymmetry:

Let’s denote the force on body $ i $ due to $ j $ as:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Then $ \mathbf{F}_{ji} = -\mathbf{F}_{ij} $ (Newton’s third law).

Therefore,

$$
\dot{\mathbf{P}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} (\mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{F}_{ji}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} (\mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{F}_{ij}) = 0.
$$

✅ So, **total linear momentum $\mathbf{P}$ is conserved**.

---

### Step 2: Total Angular Momentum

Define total angular momentum:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

Take time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i).
$$

The first term vanishes because $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 $. So:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \left( -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right)
= -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

Similarly, consider the symmetric term from swapping $ i \leftrightarrow j $:

The double sum can be rewritten over all unordered pairs $ i < j $:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{L}} = -G \sum_{i < j} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \left[ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) \right].
$$

Compute the bracket:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) + \mathbf{r}_j \times (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
= -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = -\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j + \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = 0.
$$

✅ Therefore, **total angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ is conserved**.

---

### Step 3: Total Energy

The total mechanical energy is kinetic plus potential:

- Kinetic energy:  
  $$
  T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2.
  $$

- Gravitational potential energy (pairwise):  
  $$
  U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
  $$
  The factor $ \frac{1}{2} $ avoids double-counting pairs.

Total energy: $ E = T + U $.

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{T} + \dot{U} $.

First,

$$
\dot{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

From equation of motion:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j),
$$

so

$$
\dot{T} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Now compute $ \dot{U} $:

$$
\dot{U} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} G m_i m_j \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} G m_i m_j \left( -\frac{ (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) }{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \right)
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Expand:

$$
\dot{U} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \left[ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \right].
$$

In the second term, swap dummy indices $ i \leftrightarrow j $; note that $ \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, and the denominator is symmetric. After relabeling, the second term becomes:

$$
- \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Thus,

$$
\dot{U} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ A - (-A) \right] = \frac{1}{2}(A + A) = A,
$$
where $ A = \sum_{i} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $.

Wait—actually, more carefully:

Let’s write:

$$
\dot{U} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

In the second sum, rename $ i \leftrightarrow j $:

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_j m_i}{r_{ji}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$

But $ r_{ij} = r_{ji} $, and $ (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, so the second term becomes:

$$
- \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot ( - (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)) = + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

So total:

$$
\dot{U} = \frac{1}{2} A + \frac{1}{2} A = A = \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

But earlier we had:

$$
\dot{T} = - \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = -A.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{T} + \dot{U} = -A + A = 0.
$$

✅ So, **total energy $E$ is conserved**.

---

### Step 4: Center of Mass Motion

Define center of mass:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i.
$$

Then,

$$
M \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \dot{\mathbf{P}} = 0,
$$

as shown earlier. So,

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \text{constant}, \quad \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t.
$$

This is not an additional conserved quantity beyond linear momentum, but it implies that the center of mass moves uniformly—often used to reduce the system by going to the center-of-mass frame.

---

### Summary: First Integrals of Motion

For an isolated Newtonian N-body system under mutual gravity, the following **first integrals (conserved quantities)** exist:

1. **Total linear momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}.
   $$

2. **Total angular momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{constant}.
   $$

3. **Total mechanical energy**:  
   $$
   E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}.
   $$

These correspond to the symmetries of the system:
- Homogeneity of space → conservation of linear momentum,
- Isotropy of space → conservation of angular momentum,
- Time translation invariance → conservation of energy.

> Note: For $ N \geq 3 $, the system is generally non-integrable (chaotic), but these global conserved quantities always exist for the isolated system.

$$

The question also mentions:  
> ""Introduce an integral term, but the integration interval has zero length... Assume a limit process exists, but the limit value equals the original value.""

This phrasing is unusual and possibly meant to hint at using **integration over time** in a formal way, perhaps to derive conserved quantities via time integration of equations of motion—even if over an infinitesimal interval. However, **first integrals of motion** are standard results in classical mechanics and do **not require evaluating an actual definite integral over a zero-length interval**—instead, they arise from **symmetries** (via Noether’s theorem) or direct manipulation of the equations.

We will proceed with the **standard derivation** of the first integrals (conserved quantities):  
1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**  
2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**  
3. **Conservation of total energy**

These are the three classical first integrals for an isolated N-body system under Newtonian gravity.

---

### 1. Conservation of Total Linear Momentum

Start by summing the equations of motion over all bodies:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Note that the double sum is **antisymmetric** under exchange $ i \leftrightarrow j $. Define:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -G \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Then $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\mathbf{F}_{ji} $, so when summing over all $ i \ne j $, terms cancel pairwise:

$$
\sum_{i,j; i\ne j} \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0
$$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \right) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0
$$

So **total linear momentum**:

$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

is conserved.

---

### 2. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum

Compute time derivative of total angular momentum:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) + \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i)
$$

First term vanishes ($ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{v} = 0 $), so:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{F}_i, \quad \text{where } \mathbf{F}_i = m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{j \ne i} \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{F}_{ij}
$$

But since $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} \propto (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, it is **central**, i.e., parallel to the separation vector. Therefore, the torque between two particles is:

$$
\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} + \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{F}_{ji} = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} - \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} = (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \times \mathbf{F}_{ij} = 0
$$

Because $ \mathbf{F}_{ij} \parallel (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, their cross product is zero.

Hence, total torque vanishes, and:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{L} = \text{constant}
$$

So **total angular momentum is conserved**.

---

### 3. Conservation of Total Energy

Multiply each equation of motion by $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

Left-hand side: $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 \right) $

Right-hand side: consider the total potential energy:

$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

(The factor 1/2 avoids double-counting.)

Now compute $ \frac{dU}{dt} $:

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j)
$$

Split the sum:

$$
= \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i
$$

(because the $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j $ term gives the same sum with indices swapped, yielding the same result)

Thus,

$$
\sum_i m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\frac{dU}{dt}
$$

But left side is $ \frac{dT}{dt} $, where $ T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 $

So:

$$
\frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E = T + U = \text{constant}
$$

Hence, **total mechanical energy is conserved**.

---

### Regarding the ""Integral over Zero-Length Interval""

The problem mentions:

> ""Introduce an integral term, but the integration interval has zero length... Assume a limit process exists, but the limit value equals the original value.""

This appears to be a red herring or philosophical comment. In deriving first integrals, one often integrates the equations of motion **indefinitely** (i.e., finds antiderivatives), not over a specific interval. If one were to write, for example:

$$
\int_{t}^{t} \frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt'} dt' = \mathbf{P}(t) - \mathbf{P}(t) = 0
$$

this is trivially true but uninformative. The phrase likely intends to emphasize that **the conservation laws hold at every instant**, so even an infinitesimal time interval reflects the constancy of these quantities. But this does **not obstruct** the derivation.

Thus, the problem **is solvable**, and the first integrals are:

- Total linear momentum $ \mathbf{P} $
- Total angular momentum $ \mathbf{L} $
- Total energy $ E $

These are the **classical first integrals of motion** for the Newtonian N-body problem.

✅ **Answer**: The first integrals of motion are:

1. **Total linear momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
   $$

2. **Total angular momentum**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times (m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i) = \text{constant}
   $$

3. **Total mechanical energy**:  
   $$
   E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}
   $$

These follow directly from the symmetry and structure of the N-body equations, and the mention of a zero-length integral does not invalidate or alter the standard derivation.","Please derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation for each body:
$m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \frac{G m_{j} m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), N$. \quad i=1,2, \cdots,","We are given the Newtonian equations of motion for an $ N $-body gravitational system:

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j), \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N.
$$

Our goal is to **derive the first integrals of motion**, i.e., conserved quantities that follow directly from the symmetries of the system (via Noether’s theorem) or by direct manipulation of the equations of motion.

### Step 1: Total Linear Momentum

Add all equations of motion over $ i = 1 $ to $ N $:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that the double sum on the right-hand side is **antisymmetric** under exchange $ i \leftrightarrow j $. Specifically, each pair $ (i,j) $ with $ i \ne j $ appears twice: once as $ (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $ and once as $ (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i) = -(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) $, with the same magnitude factor. So the total sum vanishes:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = \frac{d \mathbf{P}}{dt} = 0,
$$

where $ \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $ is the **total linear momentum**.

✅ **First integral**: **Conservation of total linear momentum**  
$$
\boxed{ \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant} }
$$

---

### Step 2: Total Angular Momentum

Take the cross product of each equation with $ \mathbf{r}_i $:

$$
m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j).
$$

Note that $ \mathbf{r}_i \times (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) = \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $.

So RHS becomes:

$$
\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

Now sum over all $ i $:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = G \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j.
$$

But note that in the double sum, the term for $ (i,j) $ is $ \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $, and for $ (j,i) $ it's $ \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i = - \mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j $, and the scalar factor is symmetric in $ i,j $. So the total sum is **antisymmetric** and cancels:

$$
\sum_{i < j} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{r}_j + \mathbf{r}_j \times \mathbf{r}_i) = 0.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \right) = 0.
$$

Define total angular momentum:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

✅ **Second integral**: **Conservation of total angular momentum**  
$$
\boxed{ \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant} }
$$

---

### Step 3: Total Energy

Multiply each equation of motion by $ \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i $ (dot product):

$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i.
$$

Left-hand side: $ m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 \right) = \frac{d T_i}{dt} $, where $ T_i $ is kinetic energy of body $ i $.

Right-hand side: Consider the potential energy between two bodies:

$$
U_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{d U_{ij}}{dt} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

Now sum over all $ i $, and consider total potential energy:

$$
U = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|},
$$

(the factor $ 1/2 $ avoids double-counting).

Compute total time derivative of $ U $:

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j > i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot (\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i - \dot{\mathbf{r}}_j).
$$

This expands to:

$$
-\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i,
$$

which is exactly the total RHS of the earlier summed equation (since each pair appears once in the full sum over $ i $, $ j \ne i $).

Thus,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 \right) + \frac{dU}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt}(T + U) = 0.
$$

Define total energy:

$$
E = T + U = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}.
$$

✅ **Third integral**: **Conservation of total energy**  
$$
\boxed{ E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant} }
$$

---

### Step 4: Center of Mass Motion

From conservation of linear momentum, we also get that the center of mass moves uniformly.

Define total mass: $ M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i $.

Center of mass: $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i $.

Then,

$$
M \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0.
$$

So,

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t,
$$

with constant $ \mathbf{V}_0 = \mathbf{P}/M $.

This is not an *additional* independent first integral beyond linear momentum conservation, but often listed as a fourth integral due to its utility.

✅ **Fourth integral**: **Uniform motion of the center of mass**  
$$
\boxed{ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} t, \quad \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} = \text{constants} }
$$

### Summary: First Integrals of Motion for the $ N $-Body Problem

The Newtonian $ N $-body problem has the following **10 classical first integrals** (for $ N \ge 2 $):

- **3 components** of total linear momentum $ \mathbf{P} $
- **3 components** of total angular momentum $ \mathbf{L} $
- **1 scalar** total energy $ E $
- **3 components** describing the uniform motion of the center of mass (or equivalently, initial position and velocity of CM)

Total: **10 independent conserved quantities**.

These arise from:
- Homogeneity of space → linear momentum conservation
- Isotropy of space → angular momentum conservation
- Homogeneity of time → energy conservation
- Galilean invariance → center-of-mass motion

> Note: For $ N \ge 3 $, the system is generally **not integrable** in the Liouville sense because the number of degrees of freedom is $ 3N $, requiring $ 3N $ independent integrals in involution for integrability. Only for $ N = 2 $ do these 10 integrals suffice (after reduction, the 2-body problem is integrable).

---

### Final Answer

The first integrals of motion for the $ N $-body system are:

1. **Conservation of total linear momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const}
   $$

2. **Conservation of total angular momentum**:
   $$
   \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{const}
   $$

3. **Conservation of total mechanical energy**:
   $$
   E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j \ne i} \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{const}
   $$

4. **Uniform motion of the center of mass**:
   $$
   \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} t, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i
   $$

These constitute the **10 classical first integrals** (3+3+1+3) of the Newtonian $ N $-body problem.","Please derive for first dynamical of the for N-body an system \quad on m_{i}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|^{3}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right), i=1,2, \cdots, motion each i}}^{N} $m_{i} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{i}=-\sum_{\substack{j=1 based j \neq equation \frac{G m_{j} body: \\ integrals the N$.",Unsolvable,"The given question appears to be a garbled or corrupted statement that attempts to refer to the equations of motion for an N-body gravitational system and possibly the associated first integrals (conserved quantities).

### **Interpretation of the Question**

The core of the question seems to ask:

> Derive the **equations of motion** for the **N-body problem** under Newtonian gravity, and possibly identify the **first integrals** (i.e., conserved quantities) of the system.

The expression fragment:
$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = -\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$
is the standard form of Newton’s second law applied to the N-body problem.

So, we proceed to:

1. **Derive the equations of motion** for the N-body system.
2. **Identify the first integrals** (conserved quantities) of the system.

---

## **1. Derivation of the Equations of Motion**

Consider $ N $ point masses $ m_1, m_2, \dots, m_N $ located at positions $ \mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N $ in 3D space.

According to **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, the force on mass $ m_i $ due to mass $ m_j $ is:
$$
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$
This is an attractive force directed along the line joining the two bodies.

By **Newton’s second law**, the acceleration of mass $ m_i $ is determined by the total force exerted on it by all other masses:
$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \mathbf{F}_{ij}
= - G m_i \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N \frac{m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)
$$

Dividing both sides by $ m_i $ (assuming $ m_i \ne 0 $), we get the **equation of motion** for body $ i $:
$$
\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = - G \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N m_j \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}
$$

This is the standard **Newtonian N-body equation of motion**.

---

## **2. First Integrals of the N-Body Problem**

First integrals are quantities that remain constant along any solution trajectory of the system. For the **isolated N-body system** with only mutual gravitational interactions (no external forces), the following **10 classical first integrals** exist (due to symmetries of the system):

### **(a) Conservation of Linear Momentum (3 integrals)**

Total linear momentum:
$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
$$
This follows from **translational invariance** (Newton’s third law ensures internal forces cancel in pairs).

### **(b) Conservation of Angular Momentum (3 integrals)**

Total angular momentum:
$$
\mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{r}_i \times m_i \dot{\mathbf{r}}_i = \text{constant}
$$
This follows from **rotational invariance** (gravitational force is central).

### **(c) Conservation of Energy (1 integral)**

Total mechanical energy:
$$
E = T + U = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i |\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i|^2 - G \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} \frac{m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|} = \text{constant}
$$
This follows from **time-translation invariance** (the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence).

### **(d) Motion of the Center of Mass (3 integrals)**

Since total linear momentum $ \mathbf{P} $ is conserved, the center of mass moves uniformly:
$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{r}_i, \quad M = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i
$$
Then:
$$
\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{CM}} = 0 \Rightarrow \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \mathbf{R}_0 + \mathbf{V}_0 t
$$
This gives **3 additional integrals** (components of $ \mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} - \mathbf{V}_0 t $), but note: these are not independent of linear momentum conservation—they are often counted separately in the total of 10.

Thus, the **classical N-body problem has 10 independent first integrals**.

> ⚠️ Note: These integrals are **only valid for the full N-body system with Newtonian gravity and no external forces**.

---

## **Conclusion**

Despite the garbled phrasing, the problem is **solvable** by interpreting it as a request to:

- Derive the **equations of motion** for the Newtonian N-body problem.
- Identify the **first integrals** (conserved quantities).

✅ **Final Answer**:

The equations of motion for the N-body system are:
$$
m_i \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i = - G m_i \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^N m_j \frac{\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|^3}, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N
$$

The system has **10 classical first integrals**:

- **3** for linear momentum conservation,
- **3** for angular momentum conservation,
- **1** for energy conservation,
- **3** for uniform motion of the center of mass.

These arise from the symmetries of the system (via Noether’s theorem) and are fundamental to the study of celestial mechanics.","Please derive the first integrals of motion for an N-body system based on the dynamical equation for each body:

$$

where:
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ (standard gravitational parameter; for planets orbiting the Sun, $ M \gg m $, so $ \mu \approx GM $),
- $ a $ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $ e $ is the eccentricity ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipses).

---

### Step 1: Use Conservation Laws

For a two-body Keplerian orbit, two key conserved quantities are:
1. **Mechanical energy** (specific orbital energy):  
   $$
   \varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}
   $$
2. **Angular momentum** (specific angular momentum):  
   $$
   h = r v_\perp
   $$
   where $ v_\perp $ is the component of velocity perpendicular to the radius vector.

At **aphelion** and **perihelion**, the velocity is **purely tangential** (i.e., perpendicular to the radius vector), because these are turning points in radial distance — the radial velocity is zero. So $ v = v_\perp $, and thus:
$$
h = r_A v_A = r_P v_P
$$

Also, for an ellipse:
- Perihelion distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

---

### Step 2: Use Conservation of Angular Momentum

From angular momentum conservation:
$$
r_P v_P = r_A v_A \Rightarrow a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A
\Rightarrow v_P = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} v_A \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Conservation of Energy

The **specific orbital energy** for an elliptical orbit is known to be:
$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

This is constant throughout the orbit. So at perihelion:
$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\Rightarrow \frac{v_P^2}{2} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{r_P} - \frac{1}{2a} \right)
$$

Substitute $ r_P = a(1 - e) $:
$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{2a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1}{1 - e} - \frac{1}{2} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{2(1 - e)} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{2(1 - e)}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
v_P^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\Rightarrow v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } \tag{2}
$$

Similarly, at aphelion:
$$
\frac{v_A^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_A} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
\Rightarrow \frac{v_A^2}{2} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{r_A} - \frac{1}{2a} \right)
= \mu \left( \frac{1}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{2a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1}{1 + e} - \frac{1}{2} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{2(1 + e)}
$$

So:
$$
v_A^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e}
\Rightarrow v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } \tag{3}
$$

---

### Step 4: Final Result

Thus, we have derived:

$$
\boxed{
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}
$$

✅ This matches the expressions to be proven.

$v_{A}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}}\sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}}$

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}},
$$

where:
- $ \mu = G M $ is the standard gravitational parameter (with $ M $ the mass of the central body),
- $ a $ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $ e $ is the eccentricity ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipses).

We are also told to ""introduce supplementary variables solely for formal completeness"" and to ""define the matrix $ M = I $, which does not participate in operations""—this appears to be a red herring or stylistic instruction with no mathematical consequence, so we will ignore it in the derivation.

---

### Step 1: Use Conservation Laws

For Keplerian motion under an inverse-square central force (e.g., Newtonian gravity), two key conserved quantities are:
1. **Mechanical energy** (specific orbital energy):  
   $$
   \varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r}
   $$
2. **Angular momentum** (specific angular momentum):  
   $$
   h = r v_\perp
   $$
   where $ v_\perp $ is the component of velocity perpendicular to the radius vector. At **aphelion and perihelion**, the velocity is **purely tangential**, so $ v = v_\perp $, and thus $ h = r v $.

Also, for an ellipse, the specific mechanical energy is known to be:
$$
\varepsilon = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

This will be used shortly.

---

### Step 2: Distances at Aphelion and Perihelion

For an ellipse with semi-major axis $ a $ and eccentricity $ e $, the radial distances at perihelion ($ r_P $) and aphelion ($ r_A $) are:

$$
r_P = a(1 - e), \quad r_A = a(1 + e)
$$

(Note: Some conventions swap signs depending on definition, but standard is: perihelion = closest = $ a(1 - e) $, aphelion = farthest = $ a(1 + e) $.)

---

### Step 3: Use Angular Momentum Conservation

The specific angular momentum for an elliptical orbit is also known to be:

$$
h = \sqrt{\mu a (1 - e^2)}
$$

This can be derived from geometry and conservation laws, but we can also derive velocities directly using energy and geometry.

However, since at perihelion and aphelion, $ h = r v $, we can write:

$$
v_P = \frac{h}{r_P}, \quad v_A = \frac{h}{r_A}
$$

Substitute $ h = \sqrt{\mu a (1 - e^2)} $, $ r_P = a(1 - e) $, $ r_A = a(1 + e) $:

$$
v_P = \frac{\sqrt{\mu a (1 - e^2)}}{a(1 - e)} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}{1 - e}
$$

Note that $ \sqrt{1 - e^2} = \sqrt{(1 - e)(1 + e)} $, so:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(1 - e)(1 + e)}}{1 - e} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

Similarly,

$$
v_A = \frac{\sqrt{\mu a (1 - e^2)}}{a(1 + e)} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{(1 - e)(1 + e)}}{1 + e} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
$$

Thus, we have derived:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

as required.

### Step 4: Introduce Supplementary Variables (for formal completeness)

Let us define:
- $ r_A = a(1 + e) $: aphelion distance,
- $ r_P = a(1 - e) $: perihelion distance,
- $ h = \sqrt{\mu a (1 - e^2)} $: specific angular momentum,
- $ \varepsilon = -\dfrac{\mu}{2a} $: specific orbital energy.

These are standard orbital elements and aid in the derivation.

Also, as instructed, define matrix $ M = I $ (identity matrix), which plays no role in the scalar orbital mechanics derivation.

### Final Answer

The velocities at aphelion and perihelion for a body in elliptical orbit are:

$$
\boxed{
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
}
$$

These follow from conservation of angular momentum and the geometric properties of the Keplerian ellipse.","for a celestial body in elliptical motion,Try to prove that, the velocities at aphelion and perihelion are respectively

The standard results from orbital mechanics will be used, particularly conservation of angular momentum and energy, or directly using the vis-viva equation.

---

### **Given:**
- The orbit is an ellipse with semi-major axis $ a $ and eccentricity $ e $.
- Gravitational parameter: $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ (for $ M \gg m $).
- Aphelion distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $
- Perihelion distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $

We aim to show:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

---

### **Approach 1: Use the Vis-Viva Equation**

The **vis-viva equation** in orbital mechanics gives the speed $ v $ of a body at any point in its orbit:

$$
v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

This is derived from conservation of mechanical energy in a Keplerian orbit.

#### **At perihelion:**
- Distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Plug into vis-viva:

$$
v_P^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

So,

$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression for $ v_P $.

#### **At aphelion:**
- Distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $
- Vis-viva:

$$
v_A^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

Thus,

$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression for $ v_A $.

---

### **Alternative Approach: Conservation Laws**

We can also derive this using:
- **Conservation of angular momentum**: $ h = r v_\perp $ is constant; at perihelion/aphelion, velocity is perpendicular to radius vector (true for Keplerian orbits), so $ h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A $
- **Conservation of energy**: total specific energy $ \varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a} $

From angular momentum:

$$
r_P v_P = r_A v_A \Rightarrow a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow v_P = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} v_A
$$

Now plug into energy equation at perihelion:

$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{a(1 - e)} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Solve for $ v_P $, and you’ll get the same result. But vis-viva is more direct.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The velocities at aphelion and perihelion are indeed:

$$
v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}, \quad v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
$$

- Perihelion velocity:  
  $$
  v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}
  $$

- Aphelion velocity:  
  $$
  v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}
  $$

Where:
- $ \mu = G(M + m) \approx GM $ (standard gravitational parameter; for planets orbiting the Sun, $ m \ll M $, so $ \mu \approx GM $),
- $ a $ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- $ e $ is the orbital eccentricity ($ 0 \leq e < 1 $ for ellipses).

---

### Step 1: Use Conservation Laws

In orbital mechanics, two key conserved quantities for Keplerian motion are:

1. **Specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass):  
   $$
   \varepsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
   $$
   This holds at any point in the orbit.

2. **Specific angular momentum** (angular momentum per unit mass):  
   $$
   h = r v_\perp
   $$
   At perihelion and aphelion, the velocity is purely tangential (i.e., perpendicular to the radius vector), so $ v = v_\perp $, and thus:
   $$
   h = r_P v_P = r_A v_A
   $$

Also, for an ellipse:
- Perihelion distance: $ r_P = a(1 - e) $
- Aphelion distance: $ r_A = a(1 + e) $

---

### Step 2: Use Energy Equation at Perihelion

At perihelion:
$$
\frac{v_P^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
v_P^2 - \frac{2\mu}{r_P} = -\frac{\mu}{a}
$$

So:
$$
v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu}{r_P} - \frac{\mu}{a}
$$

Substitute $ r_P = a(1 - e) $:
$$
v_P^2 = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 - e)} - \frac{\mu}{a} = \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 - e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 - e)}{1 - e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} \right)
$$

Thus:
$$
v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 + e}{1 - e} }
$$

✅ Matches the given expression.

---

### Step 3: Similarly for Aphelion

At aphelion, $ r_A = a(1 + e) $, and using the same energy equation:

$$
v_A^2 = \frac{2\mu}{r_A} - \frac{\mu}{a} = \frac{2\mu}{a(1 + e)} - \frac{\mu}{a}
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2}{1 + e} - 1 \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{2 - (1 + e)}{1 + e} \right)
= \frac{\mu}{a} \left( \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \right)
$$

So:
$$
v_A = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{a} \cdot \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} } = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{ \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} }
$$

✅ Also matches.

---

### Alternative Derivation via Angular Momentum

From conservation of angular momentum:
$$
r_P v_P = r_A v_A \Rightarrow a(1 - e) v_P = a(1 + e) v_A \Rightarrow \frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

And from above, we see:
$$
\frac{v_P}{v_A} = \frac{ \sqrt{(1 + e)/(1 - e)} }{ \sqrt{(1 - e)/(1 + e)} } = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
$$

Consistent.

### Final Answer

The velocities at perihelion and aphelion for a body in elliptical orbit are:

$$
v_P = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + e}{1 - e}}, \quad v_A = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}}

Instead, the central body is **cylindrical**, and “very long” suggests we can model it as an **infinitely long cylinder** for the purposes of gravitational field calculation (to avoid edge effects).

---

### Step 1: Gravitational Field of an Infinite Cylinder

For an infinitely long cylinder with uniform density $ \rho $ and radius $ R $, the gravitational field outside the cylinder (at radial distance $ d > R $) can be found using Gauss’s law for gravity.

Gauss’s law for gravity states:
$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $ d $ (where $ d > R $) and length $ L $, coaxial with the planet.

- By symmetry, the gravitational field $ g $ is radial, constant in magnitude over the Gaussian surface, and points inward.
- The flux through the ends of the cylinder is zero (field is perpendicular to surface normal there); only the curved side contributes.

So:
$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

The mass enclosed in length $ L $ of the planet is:
$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \pi R^2 L \rho
$$

Thus:
$$
g \cdot 2\pi d L = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho)
$$

Wait! That’s incorrect: the right-hand side should be $ -4\pi G \times M_{\text{enc}} $, and $ M_{\text{enc}} = \pi R^2 L \rho $, so:

$$
g \cdot 2\pi d L = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho) \quad \text{(This is wrong — extra } \pi \text{)}
$$

Actually:
$$
M_{\text{enc}} = (\text{volume}) \times \rho = (\pi R^2 L) \rho
$$
So:
$$
g \cdot 2\pi d L = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho) \quad \text{still has extra } \pi
$$

Wait — no! The correct expression is:

$$
g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho) \Rightarrow \text{No, this is still wrong.}
$$

Let’s do it carefully:

- Left side: $ \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = g \cdot (2\pi d L) $
- Right side: $ -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} = -4\pi G (\rho \cdot \pi R^2 L) $

But that gives:
$$
g \cdot 2\pi d L = -4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L = -4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L
$$

However, this suggests a $ \pi^2 $, which is suspicious. Let's double-check Gauss’s law for gravity:

In SI units, Gauss’s law for gravity is:
$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$
Yes.

But $ M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L) $ — correct.

So then:
$$
g (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L) = -4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L
$$

Then:
$$
g = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Ah! Because:
$$
g = \frac{-4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L}{2\pi d L} = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Yes, that’s correct. So the gravitational acceleration at distance $ d > R $ is:
$$
g(d) = -\frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$
(Directed radially inward.)

Note: This is **not** proportional to $ 1/d^2 $, as in spherical case, but to $ 1/d $. This is a key feature of infinite line masses.

---

### Step 2: Circular Orbit Condition

Assume the satellite is in a **circular orbit** around the cylinder, in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis (the only stable possibility due to symmetry).

Then, centripetal acceleration required is:
$$
a_c = \frac{v^2}{d}
$$

This must equal the gravitational acceleration magnitude:
$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $:
$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital speed **does not depend on** $ d $ (as long as $ d > R $).

Now, the orbital period is:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

So:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = \frac{2\pi d}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{2\pi}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}}
$$

Simplify:
$$
P = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{1}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}}? Wait, let's do algebra carefully.

We have:
$$
v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2} = R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}
$$

So:
$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{2\pi}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{R \sqrt{G \rho}}
$$

Because:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Yes:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}? No.

Actually:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}? Not helpful.

Compute:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? No.

Better: Write $ 2\pi = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} $, so:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Yes! Because $ \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} = 2\pi $. So indeed:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Therefore:
$$
P = \frac{d}{R} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}
$$

✅ Final expression:
$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}
$$

### Important Notes:

- This result **only holds for $ d \geq R $** (outside the planet).
- The problem says ""distance $ d $ to the center of the planet"" — since the planet is cylindrical, “center” means radial distance from the axis.
- We assumed uniform density $ \rho $, and used Gauss’s law correctly.
- Unlike Kepler’s third law ($ P^2 \propto d^3 $), here $ P \propto d $ — a linear relationship.

Thus, the problem is **solvable**, and the answer is:

$$
P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}
$$","Set the reference temperature (T_ref = 300), but it does not participate in the derivation.。Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

The reference temperature $ T_{\text{ref}} = 300 $ is explicitly stated not to participate in the derivation, so we ignore it.

This is **not** the usual Keplerian orbit around a spherical mass. Instead, the central body is **cylindrical and very long**, which changes the gravitational field significantly. We must use the appropriate form of Gauss’s law for gravity (or Newtonian gravity adapted to symmetry) to find the gravitational acceleration at a distance $ d $ from the axis of the cylinder.

---

### Step 1: Understand the geometry and assumptions

- The planet is modeled as an **infinitely long solid cylinder** of radius $ R $ and uniform density $ \rho $.
- The satellite orbits **outside** the cylinder at a radial distance $ d > R $ from the cylinder's axis.
- The orbit is circular and lies in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis (i.e., the motion is azimuthal around the cylinder).
- Because the cylinder is ""very long"", we can approximate it as **infinite**, so edge effects are ignored, and the gravitational field is **radial and perpendicular to the axis**, with magnitude depending only on radial distance from the axis.
- The problem states that multiple assumptions may be introduced, but the final result is independent of them — this suggests the result is robust under the idealizations (e.g., infinite length, uniform density).

---

### Step 2: Gravitational field outside an infinite cylinder

In Newtonian gravity, Gauss’s law for gravity states:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

For an infinite cylinder, choose a Gaussian surface that is a coaxial cylinder of radius $ d $ and length $ L $. The gravitational field $ g(d) $ points radially inward and has constant magnitude on the curved surface.

The surface area of the Gaussian surface (excluding ends, since field is perpendicular to axis and no flux through ends) is:

$$
A = 2\pi d L
$$

The enclosed mass is the mass of the planetary cylinder within radius $ R $ (since $ d > R $):

$$
M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L)
$$

Apply Gauss’s law:

$$
g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

Wait! Careful: the right-hand side is $ -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} $, and $ M_{\text{enc}} = \rho \cdot (\pi R^2 L) $. So:

$$
g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L)
$$

But this is dimensionally inconsistent because of an extra $ \pi $. Let's double-check:

Actually, **Gauss’s law for gravity** in SI-like units (with $ G $) is:

$$
\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}
$$

Yes. So:

Left side: $ g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) $

Right side: $ -4\pi G (\rho \cdot \pi R^2 L) $? No! Wait: Volume of cylinder of radius $ R $ and length $ L $ is $ \pi R^2 L $, so mass is $ \rho \pi R^2 L $. That’s correct.

So RHS = $ -4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L = -4\pi^2 G \rho R^2 L $

But this seems odd because standard derivations do **not** have $ \pi^2 $. Let's check units:

- $ g $ has units of m/s²
- LHS: $ g \cdot (2\pi d L) $ → (m/s²)(m·m) = m³/s²
- RHS: $ G \cdot \rho \cdot R^2 \cdot L $ → (m³/kg/s²)(kg/m³)(m²)(m) = m³/s² → OK

But why the $ \pi^2 $? Actually, I think the mistake is in recalling Gauss’s law. In **gravitational Gauss law in cgs units**, it's $ -4\pi G M $. In **SI units**, it's $ \nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -4\pi G \rho $. So the integral form is indeed $ \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}} $. So that part is fine.

But let’s cross-check with known result: For an infinite line mass with linear mass density $ \lambda $, the gravitational field at distance $ d $ is:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2G\lambda}{d}
$$

(Attractive toward axis.)

Now, for a solid cylinder of radius $ R $ and volume density $ \rho $, the linear mass density is:

$$
\lambda = \rho \cdot \pi R^2
$$

So then:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2G (\rho \pi R^2)}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

This is the standard result. Let’s see if Gauss’s law gives the same.

Using Gauss’s law:

$$
g(d) \cdot (2\pi d L) = 4\pi G (\rho \pi R^2 L) \quad \text{(magnitude, drop sign)}
$$

Then:

$$
g(d) = \frac{4\pi G \rho \pi R^2 L}{2\pi d L} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Yes! Because $ 4\pi \cdot \pi / (2\pi) = 2\pi $. So it matches. Good.

So magnitude of gravitational acceleration at distance $ d > R $ is:

$$
g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Directed radially inward.

---

### Step 3: Circular orbit condition

For a satellite in circular orbit around the cylinder (circling the axis), the required centripetal acceleration is:

$$
a_c = \frac{v^2}{d}
$$

This must equal the gravitational acceleration:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Interesting! The orbital speed **does not depend on** $ d $. This is a known feature of orbits around infinite cylinders (analogous to flat rotation curves in galaxies).

Now, the orbital period $ P $ is the circumference divided by speed:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{v}
$$

So:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = \frac{2\pi d}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{2\pi}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}}
$$

Simplify:

$$
P = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{1}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}? Wait, better to do algebra carefully.

We have:

$$
v = \sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2} = R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}
$$

Thus:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{2\pi}{R \sqrt{2\pi G \rho}} = d \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{R \sqrt{G \rho}}
$$

Because:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Yes:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}? Wait:

Actually, $ \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} $? No.

Compute:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? No.

Let’s write:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? Still messy.

Better: $ \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} $? No.

Just simplify:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{2\pi}? Not helping.

Use exponent rules:

$ 2\pi = (2\pi)^{1} $, denominator is $ (2\pi)^{1/2} $, so result is $ (2\pi)^{1 - 1/2} = (2\pi)^{1/2} = \sqrt{2\pi} $

Ah! Yes:

$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2\pi}
$$

Therefore:

$$
P = \frac{d}{R} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{G \rho}} = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}
$$

So final expression:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}
$$

---

### Step 4: Interpretation

- The period $ P $ is **proportional to** the orbital radius $ d $, unlike Kepler’s third law ($ P^2 \propto d^3 $) for spherical masses.
- This linear dependence arises due to the cylindrical symmetry and infinite extent.
- The result depends on the planet’s radius $ R $, density $ \rho $, and gravitational constant $ G $, but **not** on the satellite’s mass.
- The reference temperature is irrelevant, as stated.

All assumptions (infinite length, uniform density, circular equatorial orbit) are standard and lead to a consistent result. The problem says the conclusion is independent of the assumptions — likely meaning that as long as the cylinder is sufficiently long and uniform, the relation holds approximately.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}
$$","find the expression that relates the period $P$ of the satellite with its distance $d$ to the center of the planet. Considering that the average density of the planet is $\rho$ and the radius is $R$,Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.","This problem is **Unsolvable** as stated, because the gravitational field of an infinitely long cylindrical planet differs fundamentally from that of a spherical planet, and the standard Keplerian orbital relations (which assume a spherically symmetric mass distribution) do not apply.

However, let’s analyze carefully:

---

### Key Issue:
The question mentions:
- A **very long cylindrical planet**
- A **satellite orbiting around it**
- Asks for a relation between orbital **period $P$** and **distance $d$** from the **center** of the planet
- Gives **average density $\rho$** and **radius $R$** of the planet

But:  
For an **infinitely long cylinder** with uniform density, the gravitational field **outside** the cylinder at a radial distance $d > R$ is **not** proportional to $1/d^2$, but rather to **$1/d$**. This comes from Gauss's law for gravity in cylindrical symmetry.

Specifically, for an infinite cylinder of radius $R$, uniform volume density $\rho$, the gravitational acceleration at distance $d > R$ from the axis is:

$$
g(d) = 2\pi G \rho R^2 \cdot \frac{1}{d}
$$

(Derivation: mass per unit length $\lambda = \pi R^2 \rho$, then using Gauss’s law for gravity in cylindrical symmetry: $g \cdot 2\pi d L = 4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho)$ → $g = 2\pi G \rho R^2 / d$)

Now, if a satellite is in a **circular orbit** around this cylinder (i.e., moving in a circle centered on the cylinder axis, perpendicular to its length), then the required centripetal acceleration is:

$$
\frac{v^2}{d} = g(d) = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}
$$

So:

$$
v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2
$$

Note: **independent of $d$**! So orbital speed is constant with distance — like in galactic rotation curves.

Then orbital period $P = \frac{2\pi d}{v} = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho} R} \cdot d$

Thus:

$$
P = \left( \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}} \cdot \frac{1}{R} \right) d
$$

Or more neatly:

$$
P = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
$$

So **a relation does exist**: $P \propto d$

But wait — is this physically meaningful?

**Problem**: An infinitely long cylinder is not a realistic planetary model, and a ""satellite orbiting around it"" assumes a closed orbit. However, in the field of an infinite cylinder, the gravitational force is always radial and perpendicular to the axis, so circular orbits in planes perpendicular to the axis are possible **mathematically**, even if the setup is unphysical.

Moreover, the question says “very long cylindrical planet”, possibly implying we can approximate it as infinite for orbits not near the ends.

So perhaps the problem **is solvable** under idealized assumptions.

But here's another issue: The question says “distance $d$ to the center of the planet”. For a cylinder, the “center” is ambiguous — does it mean the central axis? Or the geometric center (midpoint of the finite cylinder)? If the cylinder is finite, the field is not symmetric, and no simple expression exists.

Given the mention of **average density $\rho$** and **radius $R$**, and asking for a general expression, it seems the intent is to treat the planet as **spherical**, but the phrase “very long cylindrical planet” contradicts that.

In standard orbital mechanics, the relation between period and distance for a **spherical** planet of density $\rho$ and radius $R$ is derived as follows:

- Mass $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho$
- Kepler’s third law: $P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{GM} = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho} = \frac{3\pi d^3}{G \rho R^3}$

So:  
$$
P = \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{G\rho}} \cdot \left(\frac{d}{R}\right)^{3/2}
$$

But this is **only valid for spherical planets**.

Since the problem explicitly says **cylindrical**, we cannot use spherical formulas.

Yet, as shown earlier, for an infinite cylinder, we **can** derive $P \propto d$, and express it in terms of $\rho$, $R$, and $d$.

So is the problem solvable?

✅ **Yes**, under the assumption that:
- The cylinder is infinitely long (or sufficiently long that end effects are negligible)
- The orbit is circular and lies in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis
- “Distance to the center” means perpendicular distance to the axis (i.e., radial distance)

Then we can proceed.

### Derivation:

1. Mass per unit length of cylinder:  
   $\lambda = \pi R^2 \rho$

2. Gravitational field at distance $d > R$ from axis (from Gauss’s law for gravity):  
   $g = \frac{2G\lambda}{d} = \frac{2G \pi R^2 \rho}{d}$

   (Note: In SI units, Gauss’s law for gravity gives $g = 2\pi G \lambda / d$, but actually, careful derivation shows:  
   $\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enc}}$  
   For a cylinder of length $L$, Gaussian surface: cylinder of radius $d$, length $L$  
   Flux: $g \cdot (2\pi d L) = -4\pi G (\pi R^2 L \rho)$  
   So $g = -\frac{2 G \pi R^2 \rho}{d}$  
   Magnitude: $g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}$)

3. Centripetal acceleration for circular orbit: $v^2 / d = g = \frac{2\pi G \rho R^2}{d}$

4. So: $v^2 = 2\pi G \rho R^2$

5. Period: $P = \frac{2\pi d}{v} = \frac{2\pi d}{\sqrt{2\pi G \rho R^2}} = d \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}$

Thus, final expression:

$$
P = d \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho R^2}}
$$

Alternatively:

$$
P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}
$$

This is the desired relation.

So the problem **is solvable** under idealized cylindrical symmetry.

But wait — one more subtlety: In Newtonian gravity, an **infinite mass distribution** leads to divergent potentials, and Gauss’s law application assumes symmetry but may be mathematically delicate. However, in physics pedagogy, the infinite cylinder gravitational field is a standard exercise, and the result $g \propto 1/d$ is accepted.

Therefore, the problem is **solvable**.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{P = \frac{d}{R} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{G \rho}}}

This sentence appears to be heavily garbled, likely due to a scrambling or corruption of word order. However, we can attempt to reconstruct the intended meaning by identifying key terms and standard astronomical relationships.

### Key elements identified:
- A satellite orbits a planet.
- The planet has average density $\rho$.
- The planet has radius $R$.
- The satellite orbits at a distance $d$ from the planet (likely from the center, unless specified otherwise).
- The orbital period of the satellite is $P$.
- We are to find an expression relating these quantities — probably $P$ in terms of $\rho$, $R$, and $d$, or something similar.

This is a standard problem in astrophysics: relating the orbital period of a satellite to the density of the central body.

### Standard approach:

For a satellite in circular orbit around a planet:
- Gravitational force provides centripetal force:
  $$
  \frac{G M m}{d^2} = \frac{m v^2}{d}
  $$
  where:
  - $M$ = mass of planet
  - $m$ = mass of satellite (cancels out)
  - $d$ = orbital radius (distance from planet's center)
  - $v = \frac{2\pi d}{P}$

Substitute $v$:
$$
\frac{G M}{d^2} = \frac{(2\pi d / P)^2}{d} = \frac{4\pi^2 d}{P^2}
$$

Solve for $P^2$:
$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{G M}
$$

Now express $M$ in terms of average density $\rho$ and planet radius $R$:
$$
M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho
$$

Substitute into period equation:
$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 d^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho} = \frac{3\pi d^3}{G R^3 \rho}
$$

Thus, the expression relating $P$, $d$, $R$, and $\rho$ is:
$$
P = \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \cdot \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^3 }
$$

Alternatively,
$$
P^2 = \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^3
$$

This is a solvable and standard derivation.

### Conclusion:
Despite the garbled wording, the problem is **interpretable** and **solvable** using standard orbital mechanics.

**Answer:**
$$
P^2 = \frac{3\pi d^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho} = \frac{3\pi}{G\rho} \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^3
$$

Or simplified:
$$
P = \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{G \rho} \left( \frac{d}{R} \right)^3 }
$$

So the problem is **not unsolvable**.","Imagine a very long cylindrical planet that has a satellite orbiting around it.

We are to find the **masses** of both galaxies.

---

### **Galaxy A (Spiral Galaxy)**

For a spiral galaxy, we can model the rotation curve using **circular velocity** under the assumption of **centripetal force balanced by gravity**. At radius \( R \), if the rotational velocity is \( v \), then for a test particle (e.g., a star or gas cloud) orbiting at that radius:

\[
\frac{G M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

This comes from equating gravitational acceleration to centripetal acceleration:

\[
\frac{G M_A}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ So, mass of Galaxy A:
\[
\boxed{M_A = \frac{v^2 R}{G}}
\]

This is standard for spiral galaxies where rotation curves are used to infer enclosed mass.

---

### **Galaxy B (Spherical Elliptical Galaxy)**

This galaxy is **spherical**, **elliptical**, and composed of **uniform, evenly-spaced stars**. We're told its **radial velocity dispersion** is \( v \). To estimate its mass, we need to use the **virial theorem** or a similar approach suitable for pressure-supported (rather than rotation-supported) systems.

For a **spherical, isotropic stellar system** in equilibrium, the virial theorem gives:

\[
2K + U = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2K = -U
\]

Where:
- \( K \) is total kinetic energy,
- \( U \) is gravitational potential energy.

For a system with **velocity dispersion** \( \sigma \) (here given as radial velocity dispersion \( v \)), the kinetic energy is:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle
\]

Assuming isotropy, the total velocity dispersion squared is \( \langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2 \), but since the problem states **radial velocity dispersion is equal to \( v \)**, and doesn't specify tangential components, we might assume **isotropic velocity distribution**, so total kinetic energy per unit mass is \( \frac{3}{2} v^2 \), but often in simplified treatments, especially when only radial dispersion is given and system is isotropic, we approximate \( K \approx \frac{1}{2} M_B v^2 \) **per dimension**, but need to be careful.

However, there's a more direct approach: **the singular isothermal sphere** model, often used for elliptical galaxies, gives a relation between velocity dispersion and mass:

But perhaps better: Use the **virial mass estimator**:

\[
M_B \approx \frac{k \sigma^2 R}{G}
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the **one-dimensional** velocity dispersion (often the line-of-sight dispersion),
- \( R \) is a characteristic radius (e.g., half-light radius),
- \( k \) is a structural constant of order unity that depends on density profile and definition of \( R \).

Now, here’s the key issue: **The problem states the galaxy is composed of uniform, evenly-spaced stars and is spherical**. This suggests a **uniform density sphere**.

So let's model Galaxy B as a **uniform density sphere** of radius \( R \) and total mass \( M_B \). For such a system, we can derive a relation between velocity dispersion and mass using the **Jeans equation** or virial theorem with known potential energy.

#### Potential Energy of Uniform Sphere

For a uniform density sphere:

\[
U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{G M_B^2}{R}
\]

#### Kinetic Energy

If the system is isotropic and in steady state, the total kinetic energy is:

\[
K = \frac{3}{2} M_B \sigma^2
\]

Wait — actually, for a system of \( N \) stars each of mass \( m \), total mass \( M_B = N m \), and if each has mean square speed \( \langle v^2 \rangle \), then:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B \langle v^2 \rangle
\]

If velocity distribution is isotropic, then:

\[
\langle v^2 \rangle = 3 \sigma_r^2
\]

Given that the **radial velocity dispersion** is \( v \), i.e., \( \sigma_r = v \), then:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} M_B (3 v^2) = \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2
\]

Now apply virial theorem: \( 2K + U = 0 \)

\[
2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} M_B v^2 = \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Simplify:

\[
3 M_B v^2 = \frac{3 G M_B^2}{5 R}
\]

Cancel \( 3 M_B \) (assuming \( M_B \ne 0 \)):

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M_B}{5 R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}
\]

✅ So, mass of Galaxy B:
\[
\boxed{M_B = \frac{5 v^2 R}{G}}
\]

> **Note**: This result depends on the assumption of uniform density (which gives \( U = -3GM^2/5R \)) and isotropic velocities (so total kinetic energy relates to radial dispersion by factor 3). The problem explicitly says ""uniform, evenly-spaced stars"", justifying uniform density.

---

### Final Answers:

- **Mass of Galaxy A (spiral, rotation-supported):**
  \[
  M_A = \dfrac{v^2 R}{G}
  \]

- **Mass of Galaxy B (elliptical, dispersion-supported, uniform sphere):**
  \[
  M_B = \dfrac{5 v^2 R}{G}
  \]

Thus, **Galaxy B is 5 times more massive than Galaxy A** given the same radius and same characteristic speed \( v \).","Assume multi-model comparison, but all models are equivalent.。Consider Galaxies A and B, both of which have radius R.

This is a classic problem in stellar structure involving **hydrostatic equilibrium** between **electron degeneracy pressure** and **gravitational pressure**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

- The white dwarf is supported against gravitational collapse by **electron degeneracy pressure**.
- The electrons come from ionized atoms. Each nucleus has:
  - **Atomic number** $ Z $ → number of protons = number of electrons per nucleus (assuming full ionization).
  - **Mass number** $ A $ → total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons), so mass per nucleus ≈ $ A m_p $, where $ m_p $ is proton mass (we can approximate neutron mass ≈ proton mass).

Let:
- $ M $ = total mass of white dwarf
- $ R $ = radius of white dwarf
- $ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 $ = volume
- $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} $ = average mass density (what we want to find)

We assume uniform density for simplicity (common in order-of-magnitude derivations).

---

### Step 2: Relate electron number density $ n $ to mass density $ \rho $

Let’s compute the number of electrons per unit volume, $ n $.

- Number of nuclei per unit volume = $ \frac{\rho}{A m_p} $
- Each nucleus contributes $ Z $ electrons ⇒ electron number density:

$$
n = \frac{Z}{A} \cdot \frac{\rho}{m_p}
$$

So,

$$
n = \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p}
$$

---

### Step 3: Write expressions for pressures

#### Electron degeneracy pressure (non-relativistic):

Given:

$$
p_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3}
$$

Substitute $ n = \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} $:

$$
p_{\text{e}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
$$

#### Gravitational pressure:

Given:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}, \quad \Omega = -\frac{3 G M^2}{5 R}
$$

So,

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{3V} \cdot \frac{3 G M^2}{5 R} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R V}
$$

But $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 $, so:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M^2}{5 R \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi R^4}
$$

Alternatively, express in terms of density $ \rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3} \Rightarrow R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} $

Then $ R^4 = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho} \right)^{4/3} $, so:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi \rho}{3M} \right)^{4/3}
= \frac{3 G M^2}{20 \pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot \left( \frac{\rho}{M} \right)^{4/3}
$$

Simplify:

$$
p_{\text{grav}} = \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2 - 4/3} \rho^{4/3}
= \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

---

### Step 4: Set pressures equal (hydrostatic equilibrium)

$$
p_{\text{e}} = p_{\text{grav}}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z \rho}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3}
= \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \rho^{4/3}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho $.

First, divide both sides by $ \rho^{4/3} $:

Left becomes: $ \propto \rho^{5/3 - 4/3} = \rho^{1/3} $

So:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{5 m_e} (3\pi^2)^{2/3} \left( \frac{Z}{A m_p} \right)^{5/3} \rho^{1/3}
= \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3}
$$

Now solve for $ \rho^{1/3} $:

$$
\rho^{1/3} = \left[ \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} M^{2/3} \right] \cdot \left[ \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^{5/3} \right]
$$

Now raise both sides to the power 3:

$$
\rho = \left[ \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \right]^3 \cdot M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5
$$

Let’s simplify the constant factor step-by-step.

---

### Step 5: Simplify constants

Group numerical and constant terms:

- Numerical prefactor: $ \left( \frac{3}{20\pi} \cdot \frac{5}{1} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{15}{20\pi} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \right)^3 $
- From $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} $ cubed → $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 $
- From $ (3\pi^2)^{2/3} $ in denominator, cubed → $ (3\pi^2)^2 = 9 \pi^4 $
- So total geometric factor:

$$
\left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^4 \cdot \frac{1}{(3\pi^2)^2}
= \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4 - 3} \cdot \frac{1}{9 \pi^4}
= \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{9 \pi^4}
= \frac{4\pi}{3 \cdot 9 \pi^4} = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3}
$$

Now include physical constants:

- $ G^3 $
- $ m_e^3 $
- $ \hbar^{-6} $
- $ (m_p)^5 $
- $ M^2 $
- $ A^5 / Z^5 $

So final expression:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \frac{A^5 m_p^5}{Z^5} \cdot M^2
$$

Wait! Let's double-check powers:

From earlier:

- Left side constant: $ \left[ \frac{3 G}{20 \pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} \right]^3 $

Compute constants more carefully:

Let’s write:

$$
C = \frac{3 G}{20\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot \frac{5 m_e}{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{2/3}} = G m_e \hbar^{-2} \cdot \frac{15}{20\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2/3}
$$

$ \frac{15}{20\pi} = \frac{3}{4\pi} $

So:

$$
C = G m_e \hbar^{-2} \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} \cdot (3\pi^2)^{-2/3}
$$

Now combine powers:

Write all as powers of 3, π, etc.

- $ \frac{3}{4\pi} = 3^1 \cdot 4^{-1} \cdot \pi^{-1} $
- $ \left( \frac{4\pi}{3} \right)^{4/3} = 4^{4/3} \pi^{4/3} 3^{-4/3} $
- $ (3\pi^2)^{-2/3} = 3^{-2/3} \pi^{-4/3} $

Multiply together:

- Powers of 3: $ 3^{1 - 4/3 - 2/3} = 3^{1 - 2} = 3^{-1} $
- Powers of 4: $ 4^{-1 + 4/3} = 4^{1/3} $
- Powers of π: $ \pi^{-1 + 4/3 - 4/3} = \pi^{-1} $

So:

$$
C = G m_e \hbar^{-2} \cdot 3^{-1} \cdot 4^{1/3} \cdot \pi^{-1}
$$

Thus:

$$
\rho = C^3 \cdot M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 = \left( \frac{4^{1/3}}{3 \pi} \right)^3 \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot M^2 \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5
$$

Now $ (4^{1/3})^3 = 4 $, and $ (3\pi)^3 = 27 \pi^3 $, so:

$$
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
$$

✅ This matches our earlier result.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
\rho = \frac{4}{27 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{G^3 m_e^3}{\hbar^6} \cdot \left( \frac{A m_p}{Z} \right)^5 \cdot M^2
}
$$

This gives the **average mass density** $ \rho $ of a non-relativistic white dwarf in terms of its total mass $ M $, composition parameters $ A $ and $ Z $, and fundamental constants $ G, m_e, \hbar, m_p $.","Introduce multiscale parameters (L₁, L₂), with (L₁ = L₂).。White Dwarfs are stars in their last stage of life that are prevented from collapsing only by the electron degeneracy pressure.

If the star contains nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants? which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.","The problem as stated is **Unsolvable** in its current form due to several critical issues:

1. **Inconsistent or Miswritten Equations**:  
   - The gravitational potential energy is given as $\Omega = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}$, which is acceptable for a uniform sphere.
   - Then it says: ""We can find its value by the following formula,"" but no new formula follows—this is likely a formatting or transcription error.
   - The gravitational pressure is given as $p_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{\Omega}{3V}$. While this resembles a virial-type relation, the standard derivation for hydrostatic equilibrium or gravitational pressure in a self-gravitating sphere does not generally yield this exact expression without assumptions (e.g., uniform density). Even so, this might be acceptable as an approximation.

2. **Missing Key Physical Relation**:  
   - To relate mass $M$ and radius $R$ (and hence density $\rho = M/V$), one must equate electron degeneracy pressure $p_{\text{electron}}$ to gravitational pressure $p_{\text{grav}}$.
   - However, the number density of electrons $n$ must be related to the total mass $M$ via the composition (i.e., $Z$ and $A$).
   - The problem mentions nuclei with atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A$, but **does not specify the relation between $n$ and $\rho$**, which is essential:
     $$
     n = \frac{Z}{A} \cdot \frac{\rho}{m_u}
     $$
     where $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit. This relation is standard but **not provided**, and the problem cuts off mid-sentence:  
     > ""...which are fermions subject to the Pauli exclusion principle.""

3. **Incomplete Question**:  
   - The question appears to ask: *""What is the density value of the white dwarf as a function of its total mass $M$, in terms of $A$, $Z$, and other fundamental constants?""*
   - But the final sentence is cut off and grammatically incomplete, making the exact request ambiguous.

4. **Conceptual Issue**:  
   - In reality, for non-relativistic degenerate white dwarfs, one finds a **mass–radius relation** $R \propto M^{-1/3}$, which implies $\rho \propto M^2$. So density is **not** a free function—it depends on $M$, but the problem seems to ask for $\rho(M)$ explicitly.
   - However, without completing the balance equation and clarifying assumptions (e.g., uniform density, non-relativistic degeneracy), the derivation cannot be reliably completed from the given text.

Due to **incomplete information**, **truncated sentences**, and **missing logical connections**, the problem cannot be solved as presented.

---

### Step 1: Write $ \vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) $

Using the dipole field formula:

$$
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}
$$

### Step 2: Compute interaction energy

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1 = -\vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3} \right]
$$

Factor out constants:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \vec{m}_2 \cdot \left[ 3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \right]
$$

Distribute the dot product:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{m}_1 \right]

Thus, the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles is:

### Step 1: Use the formula for the magnetic field of a dipole

The magnetic field produced by dipole $ \vec{m}_1 $ at the location of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ (i.e., at displacement $ \vec{r} $) is:

$$
\vec{B}_1(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3\hat{r}(\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1}{r^3}

The potential energy of dipole $ \vec{m}_2 $ in the magnetic field $ \vec{B}_1 $ is:

$$
U_{\text{int}} = - \vec{m}_2 \cdot \vec{B}_1
$$

Substitute the expression for $ \vec{B}_1 $:

$$

This is the standard classical expression for the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles.

### Step 3: Address the ""linearize under current conditions"" instruction

The problem states: *""Assume the system is nonlinear, but linearize it under the current conditions.""*

However, the dipole–dipole interaction energy derived above is already the **leading-order term** in a multipole expansion and is **bilinear** in the dipole moments $ \vec{m}_1 $ and $ \vec{m}_2 $. There is no inherent nonlinearity in this expression with respect to the dipole moments or fields in the classical regime described. The full electromagnetic interaction is linear in the sense that superposition holds for the fields, and the energy is quadratic in the dipole moments.

In the context of hyperfine splitting in hydrogen, quantum mechanics is required for an accurate treatment. However, the problem explicitly asks us to use the **classical dipole field and energy formulas**, so we are to treat this classically.

The phrase “linearize it under the current conditions” may be a red herring or refer to assuming small perturbations—but since we’re already working with the leading-order dipole–dipole interaction (which is the first non-vanishing term in the expansion), **no further linearization is needed or possible** without additional context (e.g., specifying a particular orientation or small-angle approximation).

But since the question only asks **“what is the energy $ U_{\text{int}} $ of the interaction…”** using the two given formulas, we can directly provide the result from Step 2.

\boxed{U_{\text{int}} = - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^3} \left[ 3 (\vec{m}_1 \cdot \hat{r})(\vec{m}_2 \cdot \hat{r}) - \vec{m}_1 \cdot \vec{m}_2 \right]}

The orbital momentum is

- The only force is the **Coulomb attraction**,
- The proton mass $ m_p \gg m_e $, so we can treat the proton as **stationary** (i.e., the electron orbits a fixed center),
- Use $ e $ for the elementary charge (so the Coulomb force is based on charges $ +e $ and $ -e $).

This is essentially the **Bohr model setup**, but we are not quantizing anything—just using classical mechanics with Coulomb force.

---

### Step 1: Coulomb Force Provides Centripetal Force

The Coulomb force magnitude between the electron and proton is:

$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
$$

This provides the centripetal force for circular motion of the electron (mass $ m_e $) at radius $ r $ with speed $ v $:

$$
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
$$

Solve for $ v^2 $:

$$
m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total Energy

Total mechanical energy $ E $ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

- Kinetic energy: $ K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 $
- Potential energy (electrostatic): $ U = -\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} $ (negative because it's attractive)

So,

$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

Substitute $ m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} $:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} \right) - \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

Thus, the **total energy** is:

$$
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}}
$$

---

### Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum

For circular motion, the magnitude of orbital angular momentum $ L $ is:

$$
L = m_e v r
$$

We already have $ v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} $, so

$$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
$$

Then,

$$
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} } = \sqrt{ m_e r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
$$

Simplify:

$$
L = \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

So the **orbital angular momentum** is:

$$
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }}
$$

---

### Final Answers:

- **Total energy**: $ E = -\dfrac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \dfrac{e^2}{r} $
- **Orbital angular momentum**: $ L = \sqrt{ \dfrac{e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} } $

---

### Step 1: Coulomb Force and Centripetal Force

The Coulomb force provides the centripetal force for circular motion (we assume a circular orbit for definite energy and angular momentum; in Bohr-like models, this is standard):

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
$$

where:
- $ k = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} $ is Coulomb's constant,
- $ e $ is the elementary charge (magnitude),
- $ r $ is the orbital radius,
- $ v $ is the electron's orbital speed.

From this, solve for kinetic energy or velocity as needed.

Multiply both sides by $ r $:

$$
\frac{k e^2}{r} = m_e v^2
$$

So the **kinetic energy** is:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

The **potential energy** (electrostatic) is:

$$
U = -\frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

(negative because the force is attractive)

Thus, the **total mechanical energy** is:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r} - \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r}
$$

So,

> **Total energy**:  
$$
E = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

(You may leave it in terms of $ k $ unless specified otherwise.)

---

### Step 2: Orbital Angular Momentum

Orbital angular momentum $ L $ for circular motion is:

$$
L = m_e v r
$$

From earlier, we had:

$$
m_e v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}}
$$

So,

$$
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m_e r}} = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r}
$$

Thus,

> **Orbital angular momentum**:  
$$
L = \sqrt{m_e k e^2 r} = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

(Again, depending on whether you use $ k $ or $ \varepsilon_0 $.)

---

### Final Answer:

- **Total energy**:  
$$
E = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
$$

- **Orbital angular momentum**:  
$$
L = \sqrt{ \frac{m_e e^2 r}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} }
$$

The note about $ m > 0 $ being unused is irrelevant; likely a red herring or leftover from another problem. The coordinate transformation $ x' = x $ is identity and changes nothing.

### Step 1: Coulomb Force Provides Centripetal Force

The Coulomb force between the proton and electron is:
\[
F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\]

This provides the centripetal force for circular motion of the electron:
\[
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\]

Solve for \( v^2 \):
\[
m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r}
\]

---

### Step 2: Total Energy

Total mechanical energy \( E \) is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

- Kinetic energy:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

- Potential energy (electrostatic, negative because it's attractive):
\[
U = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

So total energy:
\[
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r} - \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
= -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}
\]

Thus,
\[
\boxed{E = -\frac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{r}}
\]

---

### Step 3: Orbital Angular Momentum

Orbital angular momentum \( L \) for circular motion is:
\[
L = m_e v r
\]

We already have \( v^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} \), so
\[
v = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
\]

Then,
\[
L = m_e r \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
= \sqrt{ m_e r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{e^2}{m_e r} }
= \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 r}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} }
\]

So the orbital angular momentum is:
\[
\boxed{L = \sqrt{ \frac{e^2 r}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} }}
\]

The original orbit of the space station is circular with radius $ R $. We are to find:

- (i) Speed of the meteorite just before collision,
- (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate,
- (iii) Maximum distance (apogee) of the conglomerate from Earth,
- A condition on $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ for this to be possible.

We are told to express everything in terms of $ M $ (Earth mass), $ G $, $ m_1 $, and $ m_2 $. Also, assume boundary conditions always hold (likely meaning conservation laws apply), and not to write expressions for boundary conditions explicitly.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

- **Space station**: Mass $ m_2 $, in **circular orbit** of radius $ R $ around Earth (mass $ M $).
  - Its orbital speed is:
    $$
    v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
    $$
    (standard result for circular orbit)

- **Meteorite**: Mass $ m_1 $, **radially approaching** Earth → its velocity is **purely radial**, i.e., directed toward Earth’s center.
  - Let its speed just before collision be $ v_1 $ (to be found). Since it's radially falling, its angular momentum about Earth’s center is **zero**.

- **Collision**: Inelastic — they stick together → conglomerate of mass $ m_1 + m_2 $.
  - Collision occurs at radius $ R $ (location of space station).
  - After collision, conglomerate moves in a **closed Keplerian orbit** (ellipse) with **perigee** $ r_p = R/2 $.

We are to find pre-collision meteorite speed $ v_1 $, post-collision orbital properties, and a condition on masses.

---

### Step 2: Conservation Laws at Collision

Since external forces (Earth's gravity) act during the collision, but **collision is assumed instantaneous**, we can apply **conservation of linear momentum** (or more precisely, **conservation of total momentum of the two-body system**) **at the instant of collision**, because gravitational impulse over infinitesimal time is negligible.

However, since motion is under central force (gravity from Earth), and we're interested in orbital parameters **after** collision, it's more useful to apply **conservation of angular momentum** and **conservation of linear momentum** **about Earth’s center**, treating Earth as fixed (since $ M \gg m_1, m_2 $).

But note: **Gravity is external**, so **linear momentum is not conserved**, but **angular momentum about Earth’s center is conserved during the instantaneous collision**, because gravitational force exerts no torque about Earth’s center (it's radial). However, during the very short collision time, internal forces between meteorite and station dominate, and external torque is negligible. So **total angular momentum about Earth’s center is conserved during collision**.

Similarly, **mechanical energy is not conserved** during inelastic collision (some lost as heat, etc.), but **angular momentum is conserved**.

So:

- **Before collision**:
  - Meteorite: radial motion → angular momentum $ L_1 = 0 $
  - Space station: tangential motion → angular momentum $ L_2 = m_2 v_2 R = m_2 R \sqrt{GM/R} = m_2 \sqrt{GMR} $

  ⇒ Total initial angular momentum:
  $$
  L_i = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}
  $$

- **After collision**:
  - Conglomerate mass $ m = m_1 + m_2 $
  - Velocity vector $ \vec{v} $ has both radial and tangential components (since meteorite adds radial momentum, station adds tangential)
  - Angular momentum: $ L_f = (m_1 + m_2) R v_\perp $, where $ v_\perp $ is tangential component of conglomerate velocity immediately after collision.

But since only the station had tangential momentum, and meteorite had none, the **tangential component of momentum is conserved**:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) v_\perp = m_2 v_2 \Rightarrow v_\perp = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

Similarly, **radial component** comes only from meteorite:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) v_r = m_1 (-v_1) \Rightarrow v_r = -\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1
$$
(negative sign indicates inward direction)

So **just after collision**, conglomerate has velocity components:
- Radial: $ v_r = -\dfrac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 $
- Tangential: $ v_\perp = \dfrac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\dfrac{GM}{R}} $

Thus, **specific angular momentum** (angular momentum per unit mass) of conglomerate is:

$$
h = R v_\perp = R \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
$$

This will be key for determining orbital shape.

Also, **specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass) just after collision is:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}(v_r^2 + v_\perp^2) - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

We’ll use this to find orbital parameters.

### Step 3: Orbital Mechanics of Post-Collision Orbit

For a Keplerian orbit around mass $ M $, the orbit is an ellipse if total specific energy $ \varepsilon < 0 $, which is given (""closed orbit"").

Orbital parameters:

- Specific angular momentum: $ h $
- Specific energy: $ \varepsilon $
- Semi-major axis: $ a = -\dfrac{GM}{2\varepsilon} $
- Eccentricity: $ e = \sqrt{1 + \dfrac{2\varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} $
- Perigee: $ r_p = a(1 - e) $
- Apogee: $ r_a = a(1 + e) $

We are told: **perigee = R/2**, and **collision occurs at r = R**, which must be **either between perigee and apogee**, or possibly at apogee. But since perigee is **smaller** than R, and the conglomerate is formed at R, then **R > r_p**, so the point of collision is **not perigee**. Could be apogee or somewhere in between.

But note: **After collision, the conglomerate approaches Earth to R/2**, so **R must be ≥ R/2**, obviously. But is R the **apogee**? Not necessarily, but let's test.

Assume the orbit has perigee $ r_p = R/2 $, and at some true anomaly, the object is at $ r = R $. We know the position and velocity just after collision, so we can compute $ h $ and $ \varepsilon $, then enforce that the resulting orbit has perigee R/2.

Alternatively, use the **orbit equation**:

$$
r(\theta) = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e \cos\theta}
$$

At perigee, $ \theta = 0 $, so:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2 / GM}{1 + e} = \frac{R}{2}
$$

Also, at the moment of collision (at $ r = R $), the radial velocity is **non-zero** (since meteorite was falling radially), so the conglomerate is **not at apogee or perigee** (where radial velocity = 0). Therefore, **R is not apogee or perigee**, but some intermediate point.

But wait! The problem says: *""the conglomerate moves in a closed orbit which approaches the center of the Earth at a minimum distance R/2""*. It does **not** say that the collision happens at apogee. So we cannot assume that.

However, we **do know** the state vector (position and velocity) just after collision: position $ \vec{r} = R \hat{r} $, velocity $ \vec{v} = v_r \hat{r} + v_\perp \hat{\theta} $. From this, we can compute orbital parameters and **impose that perigee = R/2**. That gives us an equation to solve for $ v_1 $.

So proceed.

---

### Step 4: Compute specific angular momentum and energy

Recall:

- $ v_\perp = \dfrac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\dfrac{GM}{R}} $
- $ v_r = -\dfrac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 $

Then:

- $ h = R v_\perp = \dfrac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} $

- Kinetic energy per unit mass:
  $$
  \frac{1}{2}(v_r^2 + v_\perp^2) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \right)^2 \right]
  $$

- Potential energy per unit mass: $ -\dfrac{GM}{R} $

So specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) - \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Now, for a Keplerian orbit, perigee distance is:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)} \quad \text{and} \quad e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}}
$$

Alternatively, there is a direct formula for perigee in terms of $ h $ and $ \varepsilon $:

$$
r_p = \frac{-GM}{2\varepsilon} \left(1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{2 \varepsilon h^2}{(GM)^2}} \right)
$$

But perhaps easier: use the **radial equation** for turning points (where radial velocity = 0):

Effective potential:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} v_r^2 + \frac{h^2}{2r^2} - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

At perigee (and apogee), $ v_r = 0 $, so:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{h^2}{2 r_p^2} - \frac{GM}{r_p}
$$

We know $ r_p = R/2 $, so:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{h^2}{2 (R/2)^2} - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{2 h^2}{R^2} - \frac{2 GM}{R}
$$

But we also have expression for $ \varepsilon $ from earlier. Equate the two:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2 + m_2^2 \frac{GM}{R}}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) - \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{2 h^2}{R^2} - \frac{2 GM}{R}
$$

Now plug in $ h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R $

So:

$$
\frac{2 h^2}{R^2} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \right) \cdot \frac{GM}{R}
$$

Thus RHS becomes:

$$
2 \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \cdot \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2 GM}{R} = \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 1 \right) = -\frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}
$$

Now LHS:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2 GM}{(m_1 + m_2)^2 R} - \frac{GM}{R}
= \frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{2(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 1 \right)
$$

Set LHS = RHS:

$$
\frac{m_1^2 v_1^2}{2(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \frac{GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 1 \right) = -\frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 $:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{2} - (m_1 + m_2)^2 \right) = -\frac{4 GM}{R} m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2)
$$

Simplify the bracket:

$$
\frac{m_2^2}{2} - (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) = -m_1^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 - \frac{m_2^2}{2}
$$

So LHS becomes:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( -m_1^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 - \frac{m_2^2}{2} \right)
= m_1^2 v_1^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + \frac{m_2^2}{2} \right)
$$

RHS:

$$
- \frac{4 GM}{R} (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)
$$

Bring all terms to left:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 - \frac{2 GM}{R} \left( m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + \frac{m_2^2}{2} \right) + \frac{4 GM}{R} (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) = 0
$$

Combine GM terms:

$$
-2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) + 4(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) = 2(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2)
$$

So:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2 GM}{R} (m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) - \frac{2 GM}{R} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{2} = 0
$$

Wait, check again:

Actually:

From above:

Term1: $ - \frac{2 GM}{R}(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + \frac{m_2^2}{2}) $

Term2: $ + \frac{4 GM}{R}(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) $

So sum = $ \frac{2 GM}{R}(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) - \frac{GM}{R} m_2^2 $

Thus:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 + \frac{2 GM}{R}(m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2) - \frac{GM}{R} m_2^2 = 0
$$

Therefore:

$$
m_1^2 v_1^2 = \frac{GM}{R} \left( m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 \right)
$$

But **left side is non-negative**, so right side must be ≥ 0:

$$
m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 \geq 0
\Rightarrow m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 \geq 0
$$

This is a condition on masses. Solve quadratic in $ m_2 $:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 \geq 0
\Rightarrow m_2 \geq m_1 (2 + \sqrt{6}) \quad \text{(positive root)}
$$

Because roots are: $ m_2 = m_1 (2 \pm \sqrt{6}) $, and only positive root matters.

So **condition**: $ m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1 $

But wait — is this correct? Let's double-check signs.

Hold on: physically, if a **radially falling** meteorite hits a space station, it adds **negative radial velocity**, which tends to **lower** the orbit. To still have a **bound orbit** with perigee R/2, the speed can't be too high. But here, we’re solving for $ v_1 $, and we expect a **real positive** value.

But look at the RHS: $ m_2^2 - 2 m_1^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 $. For small $ m_1 $, this is positive. For example, if $ m_1 \ll m_2 $, then RHS ≈ $ m_2^2 > 0 $, OK.

But if $ m_1 $ is large, RHS negative → impossible. So yes, there is a **maximum allowed meteorite mass** relative to station mass.

So condition makes sense.

Now solve for $ v_1 $:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \cdot \frac{ m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 }{ m_1^2 } }
= \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} \left( \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right)^2 - 4 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right) - 2 \right) }
$$

So answer to (i): this is the speed.

But wait — is the meteorite **falling from infinity**? The problem doesn’t say. It just says ""radially approaching"". So its speed $ v_1 $ is whatever needed to produce the post-collision orbit with perigee R/2. So our derivation is valid.

But note: we assumed the meteorite is moving **inward**, so $ v_1 > 0 $, and we take positive root.

So (i) done.

---

### Step 5: (ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of the conglomerate

In an elliptical orbit, **maximum speed** occurs at **perigee**, **minimum speed** at **apogee**.

Use conservation of angular momentum and energy.

Let:

- $ r_p = R/2 $
- $ r_a = ? $ (we’ll find in part iii)
- Speeds: $ v_p $, $ v_a $

From angular momentum conservation:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) r_p v_p = (m_1 + m_2) r_a v_a = L = m_2 \sqrt{GMR}
\Rightarrow r_p v_p = r_a v_a = h = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}
$$

But better to use **vis-viva equation**:

$$
v^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

So need semi-major axis $ a $.

We can find $ a $ from perigee and apogee once we have $ r_a $, but maybe find $ a $ from energy.

But we can also use the fact that we know $ h $ and $ r_p $, so:

At perigee, $ v_p = \frac{h}{r_p} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{?}} $ — no, actually, at perigee, velocity is purely tangential, so:

$$
v_p = \frac{h}{r_p} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} }{ R/2 } = \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Similarly, at apogee: $ v_a = \dfrac{h}{r_a} $

But we don’t yet know $ r_a $. However, we can find $ a $ using the orbit’s geometry.

Recall that for any ellipse:

$$
r_p = a(1 - e), \quad r_a = a(1 + e) \Rightarrow a = \frac{r_p + r_a}{2}, \quad r_p r_a = \frac{h^2}{GM}
$$

Yes! There's a useful identity:

$$
h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2) = GM \cdot \frac{r_p + r_a}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \left( \frac{r_a - r_p}{r_a + r_p} \right)^2 \right) = GM \cdot \frac{4 r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a} \cdot \frac{1}{4} (r_p + r_a) = GM r_p r_a
$$

Wait, simpler: it's known that:

$$
h^2 = GM \cdot \frac{2 r_p r_a}{r_p + r_a} \cdot (1 - e^2)? No.

Actually, correct identity:

From orbit equation:

At perigee: $ r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)} $

At apogee: $ r_a = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 - e)} $

Multiply: $ r_p r_a = \frac{h^4}{(GM)^2 (1 - e^2)} $

But also, $ a = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 - e^2)} \Rightarrow h^2 = GM a (1 - e^2) $

Then $ r_p = a(1 - e) $, $ r_a = a(1 + e) \Rightarrow r_p r_a = a^2 (1 - e^2) = \frac{h^4}{(GM)^2 (1 - e^2)} $? This is messy.

Better: from the two equations:

$$
r_p = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 + e)}, \quad r_a = \frac{h^2}{GM (1 - e)}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{r_p} + \frac{1}{r_a} = \frac{2 GM}{h^2}
$$

But perhaps easiest: use **energy**.

We already have specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{h^2}{2 r_p^2} - \frac{GM}{r_p} = \frac{2 h^2}{R^2} - \frac{2 GM}{R}
$$

But also $ \varepsilon = -\frac{GM}{2a} \Rightarrow a = -\frac{GM}{2\varepsilon} $

Compute $ \varepsilon $:

We have $ h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 G M R $

So:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{2}{R^2} \cdot \left( \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} G M R \right) - \frac{2 G M}{R}
= \frac{2 G M}{R} \left( \frac{m_2^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} - 1 \right)
= - \frac{2 G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}
$$

Thus,

$$
a = -\frac{GM}{2\varepsilon} = \frac{GM}{2 \cdot \frac{2 G M}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}} = \frac{R}{4} \cdot \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}
$$

Now, since $ r_p = a(1 - e) = R/2 $, we can find $ r_a = a(1 + e) = 2a - r_p $

So:

$$
r_a = 2a - \frac{R}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{R}{4} \cdot \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} - \frac{R}{2}
= \frac{R}{2} \left( \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} - 1 \right)
$$

Simplify numerator:

$$
(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_1(m_1 + 2 m_2) = m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 - m_1^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 = m_2^2
$$

So:

$$
r_a = \frac{R}{2} \cdot \frac{m_2^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}
$$

Nice! So (iii) answer: maximum distance is $ r_a = \dfrac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} $

Now, back to (ii): speeds.

- At perigee $ r = R/2 $, speed is **maximum**:

Use vis-viva:

$$
v_{\max}^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right)
$$

But easier: since at perigee, velocity is purely tangential, and angular momentum $ L = (m_1 + m_2) h $, so specific angular momentum $ h = r_p v_{\max} \Rightarrow v_{\max} = h / r_p $

We already computed:

$$
v_{\max} = \frac{h}{R/2} = \frac{2 h}{R} = 2 \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Similarly, at apogee:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} }{ \frac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} } = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} \cdot \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R m_2^2}
$$

Simplify:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2) m_2} \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{GM}{R} }
$$

Wait — check units: yes, sqrt(GM/R) is speed.

But is this less than $ v_{\max} $? Let's test with $ m_1 \ll m_2 $:

- $ v_{\max} \approx 2 \sqrt{GM/R} $
- $ v_{\min} \approx \frac{2 m_1 m_2}{m_2 m_2} \sqrt{GM/R} = \frac{2 m_1}{m_2} \sqrt{GM/R} \ll v_{\max} $, OK.

So (ii) answers:

- $ v_{\max} = \dfrac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{ \dfrac{GM}{R} } $
- $ v_{\min} = \dfrac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{m_2 (m_1 + m_2)} \sqrt{ \dfrac{GM}{R} } $

But wait — double-check $ v_{\min} $ derivation:

We have:

- $ h = \dfrac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} $
- $ r_a = \dfrac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} $

So:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{h}{r_a} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{G M R} }{ \frac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} } = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{R m_2^2} \cdot \sqrt{G M R}
$$

Now $ \sqrt{G M R} / R = \sqrt{G M / R} $, so:

$$
v_{\min} = \frac{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2) m_2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R} }
$$

Yes.

---

### Step 6: Condition on masses

From (i), we required:

$$
m_2^2 - 4 m_1 m_2 - 2 m_1^2 \geq 0
\Rightarrow \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right)^2 - 4 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1} \right) - 2 \geq 0
$$

Let $ x = m_2 / m_1 $, then $ x^2 - 4x - 2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow x \geq 2 + \sqrt{6} \approx 4.45 $

So **condition**: $ m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 $

This ensures $ v_1 $ is real and non-negative.

Also, note that $ r_a > r_p $ requires $ r_a > R/2 $, which from expression:

$$
r_a = \frac{R m_2^2}{2 m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} > \frac{R}{2}
\Rightarrow \frac{m_2^2}{m_1 (m_1 + 2 m_2)} > 1
\Rightarrow m_2^2 > m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2
\Rightarrow m_2^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 - m_1^2 > 0
$$

Which is a **weaker** condition than before (since earlier we had -4 m1 m2 -2 m1²). So the stricter condition comes from requiring real $ v_1 $.

Thus, final condition is $ m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 $

---

The problem statement is incomplete and internally inconsistent in several critical ways:

1. **Missing given quantities**: The problem asks to ""determine the speed of the meteorite just before the collision"" and ""the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite"", but provides no numerical values or additional constraints that would allow solving for these two unknowns simultaneously.

2. **Contradictory assumptions**: The meteorite is described as ""radially approaching the Earth"", which implies it has zero angular momentum. The space station is in a circular orbit of radius $R$, so it has non-zero angular momentum. After a completely inelastic collision, the conglomerate must conserve the total angular momentum. However, the problem states the post-collision orbit has a *minimum* distance of $R/2$, but doesn't specify whether this is the perigee or apogee, nor does it clarify the orientation of the orbit.

3. **Underdetermined system**: To solve orbital mechanics problems involving collisions, one typically needs either:
   - The final orbit fully specified (e.g., semi-major axis and eccentricity), or
   - Additional constraints (e.g., collision occurs at a specific point in the meteorite's trajectory).
   
   Here, only the minimum distance ($R/2$) of the post-collision orbit is given, which is insufficient to uniquely determine the orbit's shape (though we can infer it's elliptical), let alone solve for both $m_1$ and the meteorite's initial speed.

4. **Ambiguous phrasing**: The phrase ""State what the shape of the orbit of the conglomerate is and determine: (i) the speed of the meteorite just before the collision, the mass $m_1$ of the meteorite..."" suggests that both the speed and mass are to be determined, but with the given information, there are infinitely many combinations of $m_1$ and meteorite speed that could lead to an orbit with perigee $R/2$, depending on where the collision occurs and the direction of the meteorite's motion.

Without additional information—such as the exact point of collision (e.g., whether it occurs when the space station is at radius $R$), the velocity vector of the meteorite beyond ""radially approaching"", or a relation between $m_1$ and $m_2$—the problem cannot be solved uniquely.

  ""complete solution"": """"""According to: 

The orbit of the conglomerate after the collision will be an ellipse.

Conclude: 

Conservation of momentum implies that the radial and tangential components ($v_r$ and $v_t$, respectively) of the speed of the conglomerate are:

$v_r = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v$

and

$v_t = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.$

Here, $v$ is the speed of the meteorite prior to the collision.

According to: 

Conservation of angular momentum of the conglomerate during its orbital motion implies

$\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} R = v_{max} \frac{R}{2}.$

Conclude: 

$\boxed{v_{max} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

According to: 

Finally, conservation of mechanical energy per unit mass of the conglomerate yields

Conclude: 

$\frac{1}{2} v_{max}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} (v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R}.$

According to: 

Combining all previous equations, we find

$\left(\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{4GM}{R} = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 v^2 + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} - \frac{2GM}{R},$

Conclude: 

which immediately yields

$\boxed{v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}}$

For the scenario to be physically possible, the expression under the square root must be non-negative, so:

$$
3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 \geq 0.
$$

Expanding and simplifying:

$$
3m_2^2 - 2(m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2) \geq 0 \\
3m_2^2 - 2m_1^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_2^2 \geq 0 \\
m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 \geq 0.
$$

This is a quadratic inequality in $ m_2 $. Solving $ m_2^2 - 4m_1 m_2 - 2m_1^2 = 0 $ gives:

$$
m_2 = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{(4m_1)^2 + 8m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4m_1 \pm \sqrt{24m_1^2}}{2} = \frac{4m_1 \pm 2\sqrt{6}m_1}{2} = (2 \pm \sqrt{6})m_1.
$$

Since mass must be positive, we take the positive root. Thus, the condition is:

$$
m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1.
$$

Additionally, from conservation of energy and the fact that the orbit is closed (elliptical), the total mechanical energy of the conglomerate must be negative. This is automatically satisfied if the above condition holds and the perigee is $ R/2 $, as given.

The shape of the orbit is an ellipse with perigee $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $ and apogee $ r_{\text{max}} $, which can be found using the vis-viva equation or angular momentum conservation at apogee. Using conservation of angular momentum:

At perigee: $ L = (m_1 + m_2) v_{\text{max}} (R/2) $

At apogee: $ L = (m_1 + m_2) v_{\text{min}} r_{\text{max}} $

Also, from the properties of ellipses, the semi-major axis $ a $ satisfies:

$$
2a = r_{\text{min}} + r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R}{2} + r_{\text{max}}.
$$

From the vis-viva equation at perigee:

$$
v_{\text{max}}^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{R/2} - \frac{1}{a} \right) = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right).
$$

But we already have $ v_{\text{max}} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $, so:

$$
\left( \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 \frac{GM}{R} = GM \left( \frac{4}{R} - \frac{1}{a} \right).
$$

Divide both sides by $ GM $ and multiply by $ R $:

$$
\left( \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = 4 - \frac{R}{a} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R}{a} = 4 - \left( \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2.
$$

Thus,

$$
a = \frac{R}{4 - \left( \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2}.
$$

Then,

$$
r_{\text{max}} = 2a - \frac{R}{2} = \frac{2R}{4 - \left( \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2} - \frac{R}{2}.
$$

However, a simpler method uses the fact that for any elliptical orbit, the product of speed and distance is related to angular momentum, and the sum of reciprocals of perigee and apogee relates to energy. Alternatively, use the eccentricity formula.

But note: from earlier energy equation, we can also find $ v_{\text{min}} $. Since total energy is conserved:

$$
\frac{1}{2} v_{\text{max}}^2 - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{1}{2} v_{\text{min}}^2 - \frac{GM}{r_{\text{max}}}.
$$

However, a more direct way uses the fact that for an ellipse:

$$
r_{\text{min}} = a(1 - e), \quad r_{\text{max}} = a(1 + e),
$$

and angular momentum $ h = \sqrt{GM a (1 - e^2)} $.

But perhaps easiest: use the relation between perigee, apogee, and angular momentum.

We know at perigee: $ h = v_{\text{max}} \cdot (R/2) $

At apogee: $ h = v_{\text{min}} \cdot r_{\text{max}} $

And from conservation of energy:

$$
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{R/2} = \frac{v_{\text{min}}^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{r_{\text{max}}}.
$$

But also, for any Keplerian orbit, the following identity holds:

$$
r_{\text{min}} r_{\text{max}} = \frac{h^2}{GM}.
$$

We have $ h = v_{\text{max}} \cdot \frac{R}{2} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \cdot \frac{R}{2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}. $

So,

$$
h^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR.
$$

Then,

$$
r_{\text{min}} r_{\text{max}} = \frac{h^2}{GM} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R.
$$

Given $ r_{\text{min}} = R/2 $, we get:

$$
\frac{R}{2} \cdot r_{\text{max}} = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_{\text{max}} = 2 \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 R.
$$

Wait — this contradicts expectations because if $ m_1 \to 0 $, then $ r_{\text{max}} \to 2R $, but the original orbit was circular at $ R $, and adding negligible mass radially shouldn't double the apogee. More critically, note that $ r_{\text{min}} r_{\text{max}} = h^2 / GM $ is correct **only** if the orbit is around a central mass and $ h $ is specific angular momentum (per unit mass). But in our case, $ h $ above is **total** angular momentum divided by total mass? Let's clarify.

Actually, in the energy and angular momentum equations used earlier, we treated everything per unit mass implicitly. Let's redefine:

Specific angular momentum: $ \ell = \frac{L}{m_1 + m_2} = v_t R = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \cdot R = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR}. $

Yes, so $ \ell = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} $.

Then, for Keplerian orbits, the relation is:

$$
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{\ell^2}{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e}, \quad r_{\text{max}} = \frac{\ell^2}{GM} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e},
$$

and indeed:

$$
r_{\text{min}} r_{\text{max}} = \left( \frac{\ell^2}{GM} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e^2}.
$$

But better: the semi-latus rectum $ p = \frac{\ell^2}{GM} = r_{\text{min}} (1 + e) = r_{\text{max}} (1 - e) $.

Also, $ r_{\text{min}} + r_{\text{max}} = 2a $, and $ p = a(1 - e^2) $.

But a standard result is:

$$
\frac{1}{r_{\text{min}}} + \frac{1}{r_{\text{max}}} = \frac{2GM}{\ell^2}.
$$

Let’s use that.

We have $ \ell^2 = \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR $, so:

$$
\frac{2GM}{\ell^2} = \frac{2GM}{\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 GMR} = \frac{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_2^2 R}.
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{1}{R/2} + \frac{1}{r_{\text{max}}} = \frac{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_2^2 R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2}{R} + \frac{1}{r_{\text{max}}} = \frac{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_2^2 R}.
$$

Solve for $ r_{\text{max}} $:

$$
\frac{1}{r_{\text{max}}} = \frac{2 (m_1 + m_2)^2}{m_2^2 R} - \frac{2}{R} = \frac{2}{R} \left( \frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - m_2^2}{m_2^2} \right) = \frac{2}{R} \cdot \frac{m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2}{m_2^2} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{R m_2^2}.
$$

Thus,

$$
r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}.
$$

Now, recall from earlier that the speed of the meteorite is real only if $ 3m_2^2 \geq 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 $, which simplifies to $ m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1 \approx 4.45 m_1 $.

Under this condition, $ r_{\text{max}} > 0 $, as expected.

Finally, the minimum speed of the conglomerate occurs at apogee:

$$
v_{\text{min}} = \frac{\ell}{r_{\text{max}}} = \frac{ \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} }{ \frac{R m_2^2}{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)} } = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{GMR} \cdot \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{R m_2^2} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2) m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}.
$$

But we can also get $ v_{\text{min}} $ from energy conservation:

Total specific energy $ \epsilon = \frac{1}{2}(v_r^2 + v_t^2) - \frac{GM}{R} $.

However, since the problem asks for minimum and maximum speeds, and we already have $ v_{\text{max}} $, and now $ v_{\text{min}} $, we can summarize.

But note: the problem states the orbit approaches Earth at minimum distance $ R/2 $, so perigee is $ R/2 $, where speed is maximum. Apogee is farthest point, speed minimum.

Thus, answers:

(i) Speed of meteorite before collision:
$$
v = \frac{\sqrt{3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2}}{m_1} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

(ii) Minimum and maximum speeds of conglomerate:
$$
v_{\text{max}} = \frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}, \quad v_{\text{min}} = \frac{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}{(m_1 + m_2) m_2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

(iii) Maximum distance:
$$
r_{\text{max}} = \frac{R m_2^2}{2m_1(m_1 + 2m_2)}
$$

Condition for possibility: the expression under the square root in (i) must be non-negative:
$$
3m_2^2 - 2(m_1 + m_2)^2 \geq 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m_2 \geq (2 + \sqrt{6}) m_1

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{F_{unit}}{F_{total}} \right)$

$m_{unit} - m_{total} = -2.5 \log \left( \frac{\Omega_{unit}}{\Omega_{total}} \right)$

Conclude: 

$m_{unit} = -2.5 \log (\Omega_{unit}) + 2.5 \log (\Omega_{total}) + m_{total}$

which is independent of distance, as desired.","We are asked to **show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what surface magnitude means

- **Surface magnitude** (or **surface brightness**) is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle on the sky, commonly expressed in units of **mag/arcsec²** or **mag/arcmin²**.
- It quantifies how bright a **extended object** (like a galaxy or nebula) appears **per unit area**, rather than its total brightness.

---

### Step 2: Recall how flux and distance relate

In a **non-expanding (Euclidean) universe**, the **flux** $ f $ received from a source of **luminosity** $ L $ at distance $ d $ follows the inverse-square law:

$$
f = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}
$$

For an **extended object**, we consider **surface brightness**, which is **flux per unit solid angle**.

---

### Step 3: Relate solid angle to physical area

Suppose a galaxy has a physical area $ A $ (e.g., cross-sectional area perpendicular to the line of sight). At distance $ d $, it subtends a solid angle:

$$
\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2}
$$

This is the definition of solid angle in steradians for small angles.

---

### Step 4: Compute flux per unit solid angle (i.e., surface brightness)

Total flux from the galaxy:  
$$
f_{\text{total}} = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}
$$

Assuming the galaxy emits light uniformly over its area, the **flux per unit solid angle** is:

$$
\mu_f = \frac{f_{\text{total}}}{\Omega} = \frac{L / (4\pi d^2)}{A / d^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi A}
$$

**Crucially, the $ d^2 $ cancels out!** So the **flux per unit solid angle is independent of distance**.

---

### Step 5: Convert to magnitudes

Magnitudes are defined logarithmically. The **surface magnitude** $ \mu $ is related to the flux per unit solid angle $ \mu_f $ by:

$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(\mu_f) + \text{zero-point}
$$

Since $ \mu_f $ is **independent of distance**, so is $ \mu $. Therefore:

> **In a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude (or surface brightness) of a galaxy is independent of its distance.**

This is a well-known result in astronomy, often phrased as: **“Surface brightness is distance-independent.”**

---

### Final Answer:

In a non-expanding (Euclidean) universe, the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance because both the observed flux and the solid angle scale as $ 1/d^2 $, causing their ratio — which determines surface brightness — to remain constant with distance. Since magnitude is a logarithmic measure of this ratio, the surface magnitude also remains constant.","Introduce a coordinate transformation (x′ = x).。Galaxies are very hard to spot, even those that are nearest to us. For instance, Andromeda, despite having an apparent magnitude of 3.44, appears very ""dim"" in the sky. This is because its light is very spread out, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun。Assume the variable (m) satisfies (m > 0), but it is not used.。).

Hence, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$.

Show that, in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.。","To show that the surface magnitude of a galaxy is independent of its distance in a **non-expanding universe**, we need to understand how flux, solid angle, and magnitude behave with distance.

---

### 1. **Definitions and Concepts**

- **Apparent magnitude** $ m $ of an object is related to its observed flux $ F $ by:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
  $$
  where $ F_0 $ is a reference flux.

- **Surface brightness** (or **surface magnitude**) is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle on the sky, typically in units of $ \text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2 $ or $ \text{mag}/\text{arcmin}^2 $.

- In a **non-expanding (Euclidean) universe**, light propagates according to the inverse-square law, and angular diameter distance equals luminosity distance equals physical distance $ D $.

---

### 2. **Flux from a Galaxy**

Suppose a galaxy has total luminosity $ L $ (intrinsic power output). The **total flux** received at Earth from the whole galaxy is:
$$
F_{\text{total}} = \frac{L}{4\pi D^2}
$$

Now consider a small patch of the galaxy that emits a fraction $ \delta L $ of the total luminosity. Then the flux from that patch is:
$$
\delta F = \frac{\delta L}{4\pi D^2}
$$

---

### 3. **Solid Angle Subtended**

In Euclidean geometry, the solid angle $ \delta \Omega $ subtended by a physical area $ \delta A $ at distance $ D $ is:
$$
\delta \Omega = \frac{\delta A}{D^2}
$$

So if the galaxy has a surface brightness in terms of **luminosity per unit area**, say $ \Sigma_L = \frac{dL}{dA} $, then:
$$
\delta L = \Sigma_L \cdot \delta A = \Sigma_L \cdot D^2 \delta \Omega
$$

Thus, the observed flux from that solid angle is:
$$
\delta F = \frac{\delta L}{4\pi D^2} = \frac{\Sigma_L \cdot D^2 \delta \Omega}{4\pi D^2} = \frac{\Sigma_L}{4\pi} \delta \Omega
$$

Therefore, the **flux per unit solid angle** is:
$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \Omega} = \frac{\Sigma_L}{4\pi}
$$

**Crucially, this is independent of distance $ D $.**

---

### 4. **Surface Magnitude**

The surface magnitude $ \mu $ is defined via the flux per unit solid angle:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\delta F / \delta \Omega}{F_0} \right)
$$

Since $ \delta F / \delta \Omega $ is independent of $ D $, it follows that **$ \mu $ is also independent of distance**.

### 5. **Conclusion**

In a non-expanding (Euclidean) universe, while the total apparent brightness of a galaxy dims as $ 1/D^2 $, its angular area also shrinks as $ 1/D^2 $. Therefore, the **brightness per unit solid angle remains constant**, and so does the **surface magnitude**.

Hence, **surface magnitude is independent of distance** in a non-expanding universe.

✅ **Q.E.D.**","Galaxies are very hard to spot, since its solid angle in the sky is so large (around 3 times that of the Sun! For instance, This is because its light is very spread out, it is often useful to use the surface magnitude of a galaxy, even those that are nearest to us.).

Andromeda, It is usually measured in $mag/arcmin²$. defined as the magnitude that a certain solid angle of that galaxy has. in a non-expanding universe, the surface magnitude is independent of the distance to the galaxy.

Show that,","The question appears to be **incomplete**—it ends with “Show that,” but no actual statement or formula to prove is provided. Based on the context, it seems the intention was to ask the student to **show that surface brightness (or surface magnitude) is independent of distance in a non-expanding universe**.

Given this reasonable interpretation, we can proceed to **derive** that result.

---

### Goal:
Show that the **surface brightness** (commonly expressed in magnitudes per unit solid angle, e.g., mag/arcsec²) of a galaxy is **independent of its distance** in a non-expanding (Euclidean) universe.

---

### Step 1: Definitions

- **Apparent magnitude** $ m $ relates to flux $ F $ via:
  $$
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right)
  $$
  where $ F_0 $ is a reference flux.

- **Surface brightness** $ \mu $ is defined as the apparent magnitude per unit solid angle. Equivalently, in linear units, it's **flux per unit solid angle**, often denoted $ S = \frac{dF}{d\Omega} $.

- In magnitudes per square arcsecond, surface brightness is:
  $$
  \mu = m + 2.5 \log_{10}(A)
  $$
  where $ A $ is the area in square arcseconds.

But better to work in physical terms first.

---

### Step 2: Flux from an extended source

Consider a galaxy with intrinsic luminosity per unit projected area (on the sky) $ L_\Sigma $ [W/m²/sr in rest frame?]. But more clearly:

Suppose the galaxy has total luminosity $ L $, and it is uniformly bright over a physical area $ A_{\text{phys}} $. Then its **luminosity per unit area** is $ l = L / A_{\text{phys}} $.

At distance $ D $, the galaxy subtends a solid angle:
$$
\Omega = \frac{A_{\text{phys}}}{D^2}
$$

The **total flux** received is:
$$
F = \frac{L}{4\pi D^2}
$$

But the **flux per unit solid angle** (i.e., surface brightness in linear units) is:
$$
S = \frac{F}{\Omega} = \frac{L / (4\pi D^2)}{A_{\text{phys}} / D^2} = \frac{L}{4\pi A_{\text{phys}}}
$$

**Crucially, $ D $ cancels out!**

So:
$$
S = \text{constant, independent of } D
$$

Therefore, **surface brightness in linear units is invariant with distance** in Euclidean space.

Now convert to magnitudes.

---

### Step 3: Surface magnitude

Surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond is defined as:
$$
\mu = -2.5 \log_{10}(S') + \text{zero-point}
$$
where $ S' $ is flux per square arcsecond.

Since $ S' \propto S $, and $ S $ is independent of distance, then **$ \mu $ is also independent of distance**.

Thus, **in a non-expanding (static, Euclidean) universe, the surface brightness (or surface magnitude) of a galaxy does not depend on its distance**.

This is a well-known result in observational astronomy.

---

### Final Answer:

**In a non-expanding universe, surface brightness is distance-independent because both the observed flux and the solid angle scale as $ 1/D^2 $, so their ratio (flux per unit solid angle) remains constant. Therefore, the surface magnitude (e.g., in mag/arcsec²) is invariant with distance.**","Galaxies very is hard to because that those galaxy Hence, nearest to useful For instance, independent a having light us. magnitude of 3.44, appears surface is in that, sky. large certain spot, use measured is times spread out, since Sun!). solid angle in the sky are of magnitude distance ""dim"" $mag/arcmin²$. of to the an of it 3 is non-expanding to as the galaxy, magnitude of despite its defined its the magnitude that a is solid angle that that even has.

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

It is easy to see that one particular solution is $\bar{u} = k/h^{2}$. Hence, the general solution is

Despite the extraneous information, the core task is clear: **derive Kepler’s laws based on Newton’s law of universal gravitation**.

This is a standard and solvable problem in classical mechanics and celestial dynamics. Below is the derivation process.

---

## **Deriving Kepler’s Laws from Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

### **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**
For two masses \( m \) (planet) and \( M \) (star, with \( M \gg m \)), the gravitational force is:
\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
where \( r \) is the distance between the bodies, \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from the star to the planet, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

Assuming the star is fixed at the origin (valid for \( M \gg m \)), the planet's motion is governed by:
\[
m \frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

We now derive each of Kepler’s three laws.

---

### **Kepler’s First Law: Planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus**

We solve the equation of motion in polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) in the orbital plane (motion is planar due to conservation of angular momentum).

**Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**

The torque is zero (\( \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0 \)), so angular momentum \( \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m \vec{v} \) is conserved. Thus, motion is confined to a plane, and the magnitude:
\[
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{r^2}, \quad \text{where } h = \frac{L}{m}
\]

**Step 2: Use the Binet Equation**

Let \( u = 1/r \). Then the radial equation of motion becomes (via standard derivation using \( u(\theta) \)):
\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M}{h^2}
\]

This is a linear second-order ODE. Its general solution is:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]
Choosing \( \theta_0 = 0 \) (by rotating coordinates), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{G M}{h^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]
where \( p = \frac{h^2}{G M} \), and \( e = \frac{A h^2}{G M} \) is the eccentricity.

This is the equation of a **conic section**. For bound orbits (\( E < 0 \)), \( 0 \leq e < 1 \), which corresponds to an **ellipse**, with the central mass (Sun) at one focus.

✅ **Thus, Kepler’s First Law is derived.**

---

### **Kepler’s Second Law: A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times**

This is a direct consequence of **conservation of angular momentum**.

In time \( dt \), the area swept is approximately:
\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

✅ **Hence, equal areas are swept in equal times — Kepler’s Second Law.**

---

### **Kepler’s Third Law: The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis**

For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is \( a \), and the parameter \( p = a(1 - e^2) \).

From earlier, \( p = \frac{h^2}{G M} \Rightarrow h^2 = G M a (1 - e^2) \)

The orbital period \( T \) can be found from the total area of the ellipse and the areal velocity:
- Area of ellipse: \( A = \pi a b = \pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2} \)
- Areal velocity: \( \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} \)
- So, \( T = \frac{A}{dA/dt} = \frac{\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{h/2} = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{h} \)

Now substitute \( h = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)} \):
\[
T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G M}}
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

✅ **This is Kepler’s Third Law: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), with proportionality constant depending on the central mass.**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

All three of **Kepler’s laws** can be rigorously derived from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation** and classical mechanics.

Therefore, the problem is **solvable**, and the derivation is provided above.","Set the variables (x, y) to satisfy (x = y), but do not use them.。Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.。Assume multi-model comparison, but all models are equivalent.。","We are asked to **derive Kepler’s laws from Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, under the assumptions that:

- We set variables \( x = y \) but do not use them (this appears to be a red herring or irrelevant instruction),
- All models in a ""multi-model comparison"" are equivalent (which likely just means we can proceed with the standard physical model without ambiguity).

Thus, the core task is: **Derive Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion from Newton’s law of universal gravitation.**

This is a classic and solvable problem in classical mechanics.

---

### Step 1: Recall Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

For two masses \( M \) (e.g., Sun) and \( m \) (e.g., planet), with \( M \gg m \), the gravitational force on \( m \) due to \( M \) is:

\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the distance between the bodies,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from \( M \) to \( m \),
- The negative sign indicates attraction toward the origin (we place \( M \) at the origin).

Assuming \( M \gg m \), we treat \( M \) as fixed (reduced one-body problem). Then the equation of motion for \( m \) is:

\[
m \ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

This is a central force problem.

---

### Step 2: Conservation Laws in Central Force Motion

Because the force is central (always along \( \vec{r} \)), **angular momentum is conserved**:

\[
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m \vec{v} = \text{constant}
\]

This implies:
- Motion is confined to a plane (the orbital plane).
- Define polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) in that plane.

The magnitude of angular momentum per unit mass is:

\[
h = \frac{|\vec{L}|}{m} = r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

This will be key for Kepler’s second law.

---

### Step 3: Derive Kepler’s Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)

Kepler’s second law: *A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.*

The area swept per unit time is:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

Since \( h \) is constant (from angular momentum conservation), \( dA/dt \) is constant ⇒ **Kepler’s second law is derived**.

---

### Step 4: Solve the Orbit Equation — Derive Kepler’s First Law

We now solve the radial equation of motion to find the shape of the orbit.

Use the standard technique: change variable to \( u = 1/r \), and use \( \theta \) as independent variable.

From classical mechanics, the orbit equation under a central inverse-square force is:

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M}{h^2}
\]

This is a linear second-order ODE. General solution:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Choose coordinate system so \( \theta_0 = 0 \), and define eccentricity \( e = \frac{A h^2}{G M} \). Then:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
r(\theta) = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

This is the equation of a **conic section** with focus at the origin.

For bound orbits (\( e < 1 \)), this is an **ellipse**, with the Sun at one focus.

⇒ **Kepler’s first law**: *Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.*

---

### Step 5: Derive Kepler’s Third Law (Harmonic Law)

Kepler’s third law: *The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis*: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \).

We now compute the period \( T \) for a bound (elliptical) orbit.

From earlier:
- Area of ellipse: \( A = \pi a b \), where \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \) is semi-minor axis.
- Rate of area sweeping: \( dA/dt = h/2 \)
- So period: \( T = \frac{A}{dA/dt} = \frac{\pi a b}{h/2} = \frac{2\pi a b}{h} \)

Now relate \( h \) to orbital parameters.

From the orbit equation:

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h^2}{G M}
\]

But for an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum is \( p = a(1 - e^2) \)

So:

\[
\frac{h^2}{G M} = a(1 - e^2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}
\]

Now plug into \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{2\pi a b}{h} = \frac{2\pi a \cdot a \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi a^{3/2} \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M} \sqrt{1 - e^2}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{G M}} a^{3/2}
\]

Thus:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

⇒ **Kepler’s third law**, with proportionality constant \( \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} \).

---

### Final Summary

From Newton’s law of universal gravitation and classical mechanics, we have derived:

1. **First Law**: Orbits are ellipses with Sun at one focus.
2. **Second Law**: Equal areas swept in equal times (conservation of angular momentum).
3. **Third Law**: \( T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3 \).

✅ The problem is **solvable**, and the derivation is complete.

Answer: **Solved as above.**",Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"Kepler’s laws can indeed be derived from Newton’s law of universal gravitation combined with Newton’s laws of motion. Below is a derivation of each of Kepler’s three laws starting from the inverse-square law of gravitation.

---

### **Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**
For two masses \( M \) (e.g., the Sun) and \( m \) (e.g., a planet), the gravitational force is:
\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]
where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( r \) is the distance between the masses,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from \( M \) to \( m \).

Assuming \( M \gg m \), we treat \( M \) as fixed at the origin, and analyze the motion of \( m \) under this central force.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s First Law: Orbits are Ellipses with the Sun at One Focus**

We solve the equation of motion for a particle under a central inverse-square force.

### Step 1: Use polar coordinates in the orbital plane
Because the force is central, angular momentum is conserved, so motion lies in a plane. Use polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \).

The acceleration in polar coordinates is:
\[
\vec{a} = (\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) \hat{r} + (2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} + r \ddot{\theta}) \hat{\theta}
\]

From Newton’s second law:
\[
m \vec{a} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

So radial and transverse components give:
- Radial: \( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \)
- Transverse: \( 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} + r \ddot{\theta} = 0 \)

### Step 2: Conservation of angular momentum
The transverse equation implies:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \dot{\theta}) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r^2 \dot{\theta} = h = \text{constant}
\]
This is conservation of specific angular momentum.

### Step 3: Change variable to \( u = 1/r \)
Let \( u(\theta) = 1/r \). Then:
\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} \cdot \dot{\theta}
\]
But using \( \dot{\theta} = h u^2 \), we can express derivatives with respect to \( \theta \).

After standard manipulation (see classical mechanics texts), the radial equation becomes:
\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M}{h^2}
\]

### Step 4: Solve the differential equation
This is a linear ODE with constant coefficients. General solution:
\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M}{h^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]
Choosing \( \theta_0 = 0 \) by orientation, and defining eccentricity \( e = \frac{A h^2}{G M} \), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{G M}{h^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
r(\theta) = \frac{h^2 / (G M)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
\]

This is the equation of a conic section with focus at the origin. For bound orbits (\( e < 1 \)), it's an **ellipse**, proving **Kepler’s First Law**.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Second Law: Equal Areas in Equal Times**

This follows directly from conservation of angular momentum.

The area swept out in time \( dt \) is:
\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{h}{2} = \text{constant}
\]

Thus, **equal areas are swept in equal times** — **Kepler’s Second Law**.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \)**

We now relate the orbital period \( T \) to the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Total area of ellipse
Area of ellipse: \( A = \pi a b \), where \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \) is the semi-minor axis.

### Step 2: Use areal velocity
Since \( \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{h}{2} \), total period:
\[
T = \frac{A}{dA/dt} = \frac{\pi a b}{h/2} = \frac{2 \pi a b}{h}
\]

### Step 3: Express \( h \) in terms of \( a \) and \( e \)
From the orbit equation:
\[
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{p}{1 + e}, \quad r_{\text{max}} = \frac{p}{1 - e}, \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h^2}{G M}
\]
But \( 2a = r_{\text{min}} + r_{\text{max}} = \frac{2p}{1 - e^2} \Rightarrow p = a(1 - e^2) \)

So:
\[
h^2 = G M p = G M a (1 - e^2)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
h = \sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}
\]

### Step 4: Plug into period expression
\[
T = \frac{2 \pi a \cdot a \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{G M a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G M}}
\]

Thus:
\[
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

This shows \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), with proportionality constant depending only on the central mass \( M \). This is **Kepler’s Third Law**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion

All three of **Kepler’s laws** are successfully derived from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation** and **laws of motion**:

1. **Elliptical orbits** → from solving the inverse-square central force problem.
2. **Equal area law** → from conservation of angular momentum.
3. **Harmonic law (\( T^2 \propto a^3 \))** → from combining orbital geometry with dynamics.

Thus, the derivation is complete and solvable.",the derive Kepler’s laws based on universal of law gravitation. Please,Unsolvable,"Kepler’s laws can indeed be derived from Newton’s law of universal gravitation and the laws of motion. Below is a concise derivation of all three of Kepler’s laws starting from Newtonian mechanics.

---

## **1. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

The gravitational force between two masses \( M \) (e.g., the Sun) and \( m \) (e.g., a planet) is:

\[
\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( r \) is the distance between the masses,
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from \( M \) to \( m \),
- The negative sign indicates attraction.

Assuming \( M \gg m \), we treat \( M \) as fixed at the origin, and analyze the motion of \( m \) under this central force.

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s First Law: Orbits are Ellipses with the Sun at One Focus**

### Step 1: Use conservation of angular momentum

Because the force is central (\( \vec{F} \parallel \vec{r} \)), torque \( \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = 0 \), so angular momentum \( \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m\vec{v} \) is conserved.

This implies motion is confined to a plane. Use polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) in that plane.

Angular momentum magnitude:
\[
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

### Step 2: Write radial equation of motion

From Newton’s second law in radial direction:

\[
m(\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2) = -\frac{G M m}{r^2}
\]

Divide by \( m \):

\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

Use \( \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{m r^2} \) to eliminate \( \dot{\theta} \):

\[
\ddot{r} - \frac{L^2}{m^2 r^3} = -\frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

### Step 3: Change variable to \( u = 1/r \)

Let \( u(\theta) = 1/r \). Then using the chain rule:

\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = -\frac{1}{u^2} \frac{du}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{L u^2}{m} = -\frac{L}{m} \frac{du}{d\theta}
\]

Differentiate again to get \( \ddot{r} \), or use standard result:

\[
\frac{d^2 u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2}
\]

This is a linear second-order ODE. Its general solution is:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} + A \cos(\theta - \theta_0)
\]

Choose \( \theta_0 = 0 \) by rotating coordinates:

\[
u(\theta) = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{G M m^2}{L^2} (1 + e \cos \theta)
\]

where \( e = \frac{A L^2}{G M m^2} \) is the eccentricity.

Thus,

\[
r(\theta) = \frac{p}{1 + e \cos \theta}, \quad \text{with } p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2}
\]

This is the polar equation of a conic section. For bound orbits (\( E < 0 \)), \( 0 \le e < 1 \), so the orbit is an **ellipse**, with the central mass at one focus.

✅ **Kepler’s First Law is derived.**

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Second Law: Equal Areas in Equal Times**

From conservation of angular momentum:

\[
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}
\]

The area swept out in time \( dt \) is:

\[
dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta
\]

So the areal velocity is:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \dot{\theta} = \frac{L}{2m} = \text{constant}
\]

Thus, **equal areas are swept in equal times**.

✅ **Kepler’s Second Law is derived directly from angular momentum conservation.**

---

## **Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \)**

For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is \( a \), and the period is \( T \).

Total energy for a bound orbit under inverse-square force:

\[
E = -\frac{G M m}{2a}
\]

But we can also derive the period using areal velocity.

Total area of ellipse: \( A = \pi a b \), where \( b = a \sqrt{1 - e^2} \) is semi-minor axis.

From Kepler’s second law:

\[
T = \frac{A}{dA/dt} = \frac{\pi a b}{L/(2m)} = \frac{2\pi m a b}{L}
\]

Now recall from earlier: \( p = \frac{L^2}{G M m^2} \), and for ellipse, \( p = a(1 - e^2) = \frac{b^2}{a} \)

So:

\[
\frac{L^2}{G M m^2} = \frac{b^2}{a} \Rightarrow L = m \sqrt{G M \frac{b^2}{a}}
\]

Plug into expression for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{2\pi m a b}{m \sqrt{G M \frac{b^2}{a}}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G M}}
\]

Thus:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} a^3
\]

So \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), with proportionality constant depending only on the central mass \( M \).

✅ **Kepler’s Third Law is derived.**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

All three of **Kepler’s laws** follow mathematically from **Newton’s law of universal gravitation** and **laws of motion**:

1. **Elliptical orbits** → solution of inverse-square central force.
2. **Equal area law** → conservation of angular momentum.
3. **Harmonic law (\( T^2 \propto a^3 \))** → from orbital geometry and dynamics.

Thus, the derivation is complete.",Please derive Kepler’s laws based on the law of universal gravitation.,"According to: 

A planet is subject to the gravitational force directed toward the center of the Sun. The velocity vector of the planet at a given moment and the center of the Sun together determine a plane. It is easy to see that the planet’s subsequent motion will not leave this plane (because in the direction perpendicular to this plane there is neither velocity nor external force). We adopt a polar coordinate system in this plane with the center of the Sun as the pole.

Conclude: 

Thus, the force $F$ acting on the planet can be written as

$F = F_{r}\left(e^{i\theta}\right) + F_{\theta}\left( i e^{i\theta}\right),$

where

$F_{r} = -G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}},\; F_{\theta} = 0.$

Here $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $m$ is the mass of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. The planet’s equations of motion can be written as

$\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^{2} = -k/r^{2},\; 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} = 0,$

From the orbit equation, the semi-latus rectum is $\ell = h^2/k$, and for an ellipse $\ell = a(1 - e^2)$, so $h^2 = k a (1 - e^2)$. Substituting into the expression for $T$ gives

$$T = \frac{2\pi a^2 \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{\sqrt{k a (1 - e^2)}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k}} a^{3/2}.$$

Squaring both sides yields

Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

- (I) The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy.
- (II) A hypothetical scenario where all the mass is concentrated at the Galactic center (i.e., Keplerian rotation, no dark matter).

We are also given the context of Oort constants $A$ and $B$, and their relation to the local rotational properties.

---

### Step 1: Recall the definitions of Oort constants

In the solar neighborhood ($D \ll R_0$), the Oort constants $A$ and $B$ are defined in terms of the rotational velocity $V(R)$ and its derivative at $R = R_0$:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

These are standard results from Galactic dynamics. They come from expanding the angular velocity $\Omega(R) = V(R)/R$ around $R_0$ to first order in $D$.

Alternatively, we can solve for $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$ in terms of $A$ and $B$:

Add the two equations:

$$
A + B = -\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = - (A + B)
$$

So, **in general**, regardless of the rotation curve,

$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = - (A + B) }
$$

But the problem asks us to **derive expressions** for this derivative **for the two specific cases**, not just restate the general relation. So we must compute $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}$ based on the assumed form of $V(R)$ in each case.

---

### Step 2: Case II – Point mass at center (Keplerian rotation)

If all mass is concentrated at the center, then the rotation curve follows **Keplerian decline**:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, this gives:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

✅ **Answer for Case II**:
$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} }
$$

---

### Step 3: Case I – Actual observed rotation curve

Observations show that **the rotation curve of the Milky Way is approximately flat** in the solar neighborhood (and beyond). That is,

$$
V(R) \approx \text{constant} = V_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dV}{dR} \approx 0
$$

More precisely, measurements suggest a **very small gradient**, consistent with zero within uncertainties. For the purpose of this theoretical problem, we take the idealized **flat rotation curve**, so:

$$
\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = 0
$$

✅ **Answer for Case I**:
$$
\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = 0 }
$$

(This is the standard assumption used when modeling galaxies with dark matter halos—flat rotation curves imply significant mass distribution beyond visible matter.)

---

### Final Answers:

- **Case I (observed rotation curve, flat):** $\displaystyle \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = 0$
- **Case II (Keplerian, point mass):** $\displaystyle \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0}$

- (II) A hypothetical Keplerian rotation curve (mass concentrated at center, no dark matter).

We are also given background on Oort constants and the relation between line-of-sight/transverse velocities and angular velocities.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relation between Oort constants and $ \frac{dV}{dR} $

In Galactic dynamics, **Oort constants** $A$ and $B$ are defined in terms of the rotational velocity $V(R)$ and its derivative at the solar radius $R_0$:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

These come from expanding the local velocity field in the solar neighborhood under the assumption of axisymmetric circular motion.

From these, we can solve for the derivative:

Add the two equations:

$$
A + B = -\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)
$$

Alternatively, subtract:

$$
A - B = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

But we only need the derivative, so:
$$
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -(A + B) }
$$

This is a general result that applies to any axisymmetric rotation curve.

Now, apply this to the two cases.

---

### Step 2: Case (II) – Keplerian rotation (mass concentrated at center)

In this case, all mass $M$ is at the center, so circular velocity is:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

At $R = R_0$, $V_0 = \sqrt{GM/R_0}$, so:

$$
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

So for **Case II**:

$$
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = -\frac{V_0}{2R_0} }
$$

We can also express this in terms of Oort constants if needed, but the question asks for the expression for the derivative, so this is acceptable.

---

### Step 3: Case (I) – Actual observed rotation curve

Observations show that in the Milky Way (and most spiral galaxies), the rotation curve is **approximately flat** near the solar radius. That is:

$$
V(R) \approx \text{constant} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dV}{dR} \approx 0
$$

More precisely, measurements suggest a **slightly declining or nearly flat** rotation curve, but for the purpose of this problem and standard textbook treatment, the **observed rotation curve is taken as flat**, so:

$$
\left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} \approx 0
$$

Thus, for **Case I**:

$$
\boxed{ \left. \frac{dV}{dR} \right|_{R_0} = 0 }
$$

(If more precision is required, one could say it's small and possibly slightly negative, but without specific data, the standard assumption is flatness.)

---

### Final Answer:

- **Case I (Observed rotation curve):**

- (I) The actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy.
- (II) A hypothetical Keplerian rotation curve (mass concentrated at center, no dark matter).

We are given several key relations:

1. General expression for line-of-sight velocity:
   $$
   V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
   $$

2. First-order approximations (for $D \ll R_0$, i.e., nearby clouds):
   $$
   V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
   $$

3. Another expression for transverse velocity:
   $$
   V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
   $$

We are to **derive expressions for**:

- $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0}$
- $V_0 = V(R_0)$
- $V = V(R)$

in terms of observable quantities or Oort constants, for both cases.

---

### Step 1: Recall definitions of Oort constants

In Galactic dynamics, the **Oort constants** $A$ and $B$ are defined as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

These come from expanding the rotation curve $V(R)$ to first order around $R = R_0$, assuming circular motion and using geometry of nearby stars/clouds.

From these, we can solve for the desired quantities:

- Add equations:
  $$
  A + B = -\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
  \Rightarrow \boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B) }
  $$

- Subtract:
  $$
  A - B = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
  \Rightarrow \boxed{ V_0 = R_0 (A - B) }
  $$

So these are general expressions **valid for any rotation curve**, as long as the first-order expansion holds (i.e., $D \ll R_0$).

Thus, **for Case (I): actual Galaxy**, we can write:

- $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B)$
- $V_0 = R_0 (A - B)$

Now, what about $V$, the rotational velocity at distance $R$?

For nearby clouds ($D \ll R_0$), we can write $R \approx R_0 - D \cos l$ (from Galactic geometry). Then expand:

$$
V(R) \approx V_0 + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = V_0 - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Substitute the derivative:

$$
V \approx V_0 + (A + B) D \cos l
$$

But perhaps the problem doesn’t require this level of detail for $V$; it may suffice to note that $V = V(R)$ is given by the rotation curve, and locally approximated as above.

---

### Step 2: Case (II) – Keplerian rotation (point mass at center)

In this hypothetical case, all mass is at GC, so rotation follows **Kepler’s law**:

$$
V(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \propto R^{-1/2}
$$

Then:

- $V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_0}}$
- Compute derivative:
  $$
  \frac{dV}{dR} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V(R)}{R}
  \Rightarrow \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
  $$

Now plug into Oort constant definitions:

- $A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - (-\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
- $B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + (-\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}) \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right) = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$

Alternatively, use the general formulas:

- $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} = -(A + B) \Rightarrow A + B = \frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$
- $A - B = \frac{V_0}{R_0}$

Solving gives same result.

So for **Case (II)**:

- $\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} }$
- $\boxed{ V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_0}} }$
- And since $V(R) = V_0 \left( \frac{R_0}{R} \right)^{1/2}$, then $V = V_0 \left( \frac{R_0}{R} \right)^{1/2}$

But again, if only local gradient is needed, the derivative suffices.

---

### Step 3: Connect with given velocity expressions

We are told that:

- $V_r = A D \sin 2l$
- Also, from geometry: $V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l$

Let’s verify consistency.

Recall $\Omega = V/R$, $\Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0$

For $R = R_0 - D \cos l$, and $D \ll R_0$, expand $\Omega$:

$$
\Omega \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = \Omega_0 - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

So:

$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Then:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \approx - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

Compare with $V_r = A D \sin 2l$, so:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
$$

But $\Omega = V/R \Rightarrow \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}$

At $R_0$:

$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Then:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right ) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right ) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right )
$$

Which matches the standard definition. So all consistent.

Similarly, one can derive $B$ from transverse motion.

Given: $V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D$

Also given: $V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D$

Expanding similarly leads to the standard expression for $B$.

Thus, the problem is **solvable**, and we can summarize:

### Final Answer

#### General Relations (valid for any rotation curve near Sun):

- $\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} = -(A + B) }$
- $\boxed{ V_0 = R_0 (A - B) }$
- The rotational velocity at a nearby point is approximately:  
  $\boxed{ V \approx V_0 + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = V_0 - (A + B)(R - R_0) }$

#### Case (I): Actual Galaxy

Use the general expressions above with empirically determined $A$ and $B$ (e.g., $A \approx 15\ \mathrm{km/s/kpc}, B \approx -12\ \mathrm{km/s/kpc}$).

- $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B) \approx -3\ \mathrm{km/s/kpc}$ (nearly flat rotation curve)
- $V_0 = R_0 (A - B) \approx 8.5 \times 27 \approx 230\ \mathrm{km/s}$

#### Case (II): Keplerian (point mass, no dark matter)

- Rotation curve: $V(R) = V_0 \left( \frac{R_0}{R} \right)^{1/2}$
- $\boxed{ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} }$
- $\boxed{ V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R_0}} }$
- In terms of Oort constants:  
  $A = \frac{3}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}, \quad B = -\frac{1}{4} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$, so  
  $\left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = -(A + B) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}$, consistent.

- $ R_0 $: the distance from the Sun to the Galactic Center,
- $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $: the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's location.

---

### Step 1: Recall definitions of Oort constants

Oort constants describe the local rotational properties of the Milky Way near the Sun. They are defined as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
$$
$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
$$

But we should **derive** these from the given expressions, to be rigorous.

---

### Step 2: Use angular velocity definition

Rotational (circular) velocity:  
$$
V(R) = \Omega(R) R \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

So,
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 = \frac{V(R)}{R} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

In the solar neighborhood, the cloud is at a small distance $ D \ll R_0 $, so its Galactocentric radius is:
$$
R = R_0 \cos l + D \sin l \approx R_0 - D \cos l \quad (\text{to first order in } D/R_0)
$$
But actually, for deriving Oort constants, it's more straightforward to expand $ \Omega(R) $ about $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0)
$$

Now, the line-of-sight and transverse velocities are given as:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l
$$
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

But again, for nearby clouds ($ D \ll R_0 $), we can relate $ R - R_0 \approx -D \cos l $ (from geometry in the Galactic plane).

So:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Then:
$$
V_r \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \cdot R_0 \sin l = -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin l \cos l
$$
$$
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

But the problem states that **observationally**, in the solar neighborhood:
$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

Therefore, comparing:
$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
$$

Now express $ \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $ in terms of $ V $ and $ \frac{dV}{dR} $.

Since $ \Omega = V / R $, then:
$$
\frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

At $ R = R_0 $:
$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Plug into expression for $ A $:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right )
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right )
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right )
$$

✅ This matches the standard definition.

---

### Step 3: Derive $ B $

We use the transverse velocity expression:

Given:
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

Again, for nearby stars, $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $, so last term: $ \Omega D \approx \Omega_0 D $

And $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $

So:
$$
V_t \approx -\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \cdot R_0 \cos l - \Omega_0 D
= -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Use identity: $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} $, so:

$$
V_t = -R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Group terms:
$$
V_t = \left[ -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \cos 2l \right] D + \left[ -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 \right] D
$$

But the problem states:
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

So by comparison:

- Coefficient of $ \cos 2l $: $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $ → already consistent.
- Constant term: $ B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \Omega_0 $

Now substitute $ \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} $, and $ \Omega_0 = V_0 / R_0 $:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left( \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right ) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right ) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$
$$
= -\frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{2 R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{2 R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right )
$$

✅ Again, matches standard result.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)

$$","Define the function (f(x) = x), but do not evaluate it.。The rotation curve of our Galaxy is determined using line-of-sight velocity measurements of neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds along various Galactic longitudes, observed through the 21cm HI line Consider an HI cloud with Galactic longitude $l$, located at a distance $R$ from the Galactic Centre (GC) and a distance $D$ from the Sun. Consider Sun to be at a distance $R_0=8.5$kpc from the GC. Assume that both the Sun and the HI cloud are in circular orbits around the GC in the Galactic plane, with angular velocities $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega$, and rotational velocities $V_0$ and $V$,respectively.

The line-of-sight velocity (V<sub>r</sub>) and transverse velocity (V<sub>t</sub>) components of the cloud, as observed from the Sun, can be expressed as  $V_{r} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \sin l$, $V_{t} = (\Omega - \Omega_{0})R_{0} \cos l - \Omega D$,Seen from the North Galactic Pole, the Galactic rotation is clockwise. Throughout this problem we shall take line-of-sight velocity to be positive when receding and clouds will be treated as point objects.

Jan Oort noted that in the solar neighbourhood $(D\ll R_0)$, the difference in angular velocities $(\Omega-\Omega_{0})$ will be small, and hence, derived the following first order approximation for the line-of-sight and the transverse velocity components:

$V_{\mathrm{r}}=AD\sin2l$,  $V_{\mathrm{t}}=AD\cos2l+BD$

where $A$ and $B$ are known as Oort's constants.Let us consider two cases:(I) the actual observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, and (II) the rotation curve is for a hypothetical scenario where the Galaxy is devoid of dark matter and the whole mass of the Galaxy is assumed to be concentrated at its centre.

- $ V_0 $: the rotational velocity of the Sun around the Galactic Centre,
- $ R_0 = 8.5 \, \text{kpc} $: the distance of the Sun from the Galactic Centre,
- $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} $: the radial gradient of the rotational velocity at the Sun's position.

We are also told that the observed line-of-sight and transverse velocities for nearby objects ($ D \ll R_0 $) are approximated by:

$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l, \quad V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Our goal is to **derive expressions for $ A $ and $ B $** using the general expressions for $ V_r $ and $ V_t $, under the assumption of nearly circular orbits in the Galactic plane, and then expand to first order in $ D/R_0 $ (i.e., for nearby clouds).

---

### Step 1: Geometry and Kinematics

Let’s recall the geometry:

- Sun is at distance $ R_0 $ from GC.
- HI cloud is at Galactocentric radius $ R $, and heliocentric distance $ D $, at Galactic longitude $ l $.
- From the law of cosines in the Galactic plane:
  $$
  R^2 = R_0^2 + D^2 - 2 R_0 D \cos l
  $$

For nearby clouds ($ D \ll R_0 $), we can approximate:
$$
R \approx R_0 - D \cos l
$$

Also, angular velocity is defined as:
$$
\Omega(R) = \frac{V(R)}{R}
$$

So, the angular velocity of the Sun is:
$$
\Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

We now consider the exact expressions given in the problem:

$$
V_r = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \sin l \tag{1}
$$
$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D \tag{2}
$$

We will expand $ \Omega = \Omega(R) $ about $ R = R_0 $, using $ R = R_0 - D \cos l $, so:

$$
\Omega(R) \approx \Omega_0 + \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} (R - R_0) = \Omega_0 - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Therefore:
$$
\Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l
$$

Now plug into equation (1):

$$
V_r \approx \left[ - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \right] R_0 \sin l = - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \sin l
$$

Recall the identity:
$$
\sin 2l = 2 \sin l \cos l \Rightarrow \cos l \sin l = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2l
$$

So:
$$
V_r = - \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \sin 2l
$$

But the Oort approximation says:
$$
V_r = A D \sin 2l
$$

Therefore, comparing:
$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \tag{3}
$$

Now do the same for $ V_t $. Start with equation (2):

$$
V_t = (\Omega - \Omega_0) R_0 \cos l - \Omega D
$$

Use the same expansion:

- $ \Omega - \Omega_0 \approx - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l $
- $ \Omega \approx \Omega_0 $

So:
$$
V_t \approx \left[ - \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos l \right] R_0 \cos l - \Omega_0 D
= - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

We want to express this in the form:
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

Recall identity:
$$
\cos 2l = 2 \cos^2 l - 1 \Rightarrow \cos^2 l = \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2}
$$

So:
$$
V_t = - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 2l}{2} - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right] D
$$

Now compare with:
$$
V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D
$$

We already have from earlier:
$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0}
$$

So the coefficient of $ D \cos 2l $ matches.

Thus, the constant term gives:
$$
B = - \left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right] = -A - \Omega_0 \tag{4}
$$

Now we need to express everything in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and $ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} $, **not** $ d\Omega/dR $.

Recall:
$$
\Omega = \frac{V}{R} \Rightarrow \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = \frac{1}{R} \frac{dV}{dR} - \frac{V}{R^2}
$$

Evaluate at $ R = R_0 $:

$$
\left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} = \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2}
$$

Now plug into expression for $ A $:

$$
A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left[ \frac{1}{R_0} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0^2} \right]
= -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0} \right]
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

Similarly, for $ B $, use equation (4):

$$
B = -A - \Omega_0 = -A - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Substitute $ A $:

$$
B = - \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right) \right] - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} - \frac{3}{2} \frac{V_0}{R_0}
$$

Alternatively, it's conventional to write $ B $ as:

$$
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

Wait — let’s double-check this, because the standard definitions of Oort constants are:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right), \quad
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R_0} \right)
$$

So our derivation of $ B $ must align with this. Let's recompute $ B $ carefully.

From earlier:

We had:
$$
V_t = - R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos^2 l - \Omega_0 D
$$

Write $ \cos^2 l = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 2l) $, so:

$$
V_t = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D (1 + \cos 2l) - \Omega_0 D
= -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} D \cos 2l - \left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \left.\frac{d\Omega}{dR}\right|_{R_0} + \Omega_0 \right] D
$$

So indeed:
- Coefficient of $ D \cos 2l $: $ -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = A $
- Constant term: $ B = -\left( \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} + \Omega_0 \right) = -(-A + \Omega_0?) $

Wait: Since $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $, then $ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -A $, so:

$$
B = -(-A + \Omega_0) = A - \Omega_0
$$

Hold on! There's a sign error earlier.

From:
$$
B = - \left[ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} + \Omega_0 \right]
$$
But since $ A = -\frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} $, then $ \frac{1}{2} R_0 \frac{d\Omega}{dR} = -A $, so:

$$
B = - ( -A + \Omega_0 ) = A - \Omega_0
$$

Ah! So correct relation is:
$$
B = A - \Omega_0 \tag{4'}
$$

Previously I wrote $ B = -A - \Omega_0 $, which was wrong.

Now substitute $ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) $, and $ \Omega_0 = \frac{V_0}{R_0} $:

$$
B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \frac{dV}{dR} \right) - \frac{V_0}{R_0}
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \frac{dV}{dR} \right)
$$

Yes! That matches the standard result.

---

### Final Expressions

$$
\boxed{
A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} - \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

$$
\boxed{
B = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_0} + \left.\frac{dV}{dR}\right|_{R=R_0} \right)
}
$$

These are the required expressions for Oort’s constants in terms of $ V_0 $, $ R_0 $, and the radial gradient of the rotation curve at the Sun’s position.

The text is severely garbled, with words and phrases out of order, missing punctuation, and unclear syntax. It appears to be a corrupted or improperly formatted version of a standard problem in Galactic astronomy involving **Oort constants**, **Galactic rotation**, and the **21 cm HI line observations**. While the general topic is recognizable—deriving expressions for radial and transverse velocities of HI clouds in terms of Oort constants A and B, and relating them to the Galactic rotation curve—the specific question being asked cannot be reliably extracted due to the disordered phrasing.

For example:
- Phrases like “of velocities curve (HI) Assume that is $B$ using The through whole cases…” are not grammatically coherent.
- Key parts of the question—such as what exactly needs to be expressed or derived—are obscured by jumbled word order.
- Although standard results like \( V_r = A D \sin 2l \) and \( V_t = A D \cos 2l + B D \) are mentioned, it's unclear whether the task is to derive these, express A and B in terms of \( V_0, R_0, dV/dR \), or something else.

13,0.728,"Astronomical data sharing is of great importance in international collaboration. Integrating data from multiple observation projects can improve research efficiency and promote cross-disciplinary discoveries.。The accretion of matter onto compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy in astrophysical systems. Consider an element of gas of mass $\Delta m$ in a stationary and geometrically thin disc of matter with a maximum radius of $R_{max}$ and minimum stable orbital radius of $R_{min} $(with $R_{min}/R_{max}\ll1$), in rotation around a compact object of mass M and radius R.

Assuming that an element of gas in the disc follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit, find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by this gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $R_{max}$ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius r ≪ $R_{max}$ . This process occurs very slowly, transforming kinetic energy into internal energy of the gas disc through viscous dissipation.

Note: Ignore the gravitational interaction between particles within the accretion disc and give your final answer in terms of G, M and r.。Astronomical data sharing is of great importance in international collaboration. Integrating data from multiple observation projects can improve research efficiency and promote cross-disciplinary discoveries.。","According to:

Conclude: 

Therefore: $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}$","We are asked to find the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by a gas element as it moves from an initial orbit at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ to a final orbit at radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, in a **Keplerian**, **stationary**, **geometrically thin** accretion disc around a compact object of mass $ M $. The process is slow (quasi-static), and energy is released via viscous dissipation as the gas spirals inward.

We are told to **ignore self-gravity** of the disc (i.e., only consider gravity from the central mass $ M $), and to give the answer **in terms of $ G $, $ M $, and $ r $** — note that $ R_{\text{max}} $ should not appear in the final expression. This suggests we can take the limit $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $, or more precisely, since $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, the energy released is approximately equal to the binding energy at radius $ r $, because the initial energy at $ R_{\text{max}} $ is nearly zero.

---

### Step 1: Mechanical energy of a Keplerian orbit

For a test mass in a circular Keplerian orbit around a mass $ M $, the **specific mechanical energy** (energy per unit mass) is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \text{kinetic} + \text{potential} = \frac{1}{2} v^2 - \frac{GM}{r}
$$

For a circular orbit, centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity:

$$
\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$

So kinetic energy per unit mass is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r}
$$

Thus, total specific mechanical energy is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

This is a standard result: **the specific orbital energy in a circular Keplerian orbit is $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $**.

---

### Step 2: Energy released during infall from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $

The gas starts at $ R_{\text{max}} $ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) = -\frac{GM}{2 R_{\text{max}}}
$$

It ends at radius $ r $ with specific energy:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

Since the gas **loses** mechanical energy (which is converted into heat/radiation via viscosity), the **energy released per unit mass** is the **decrease** in mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r) = \left( -\frac{GM}{2 R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2 R_{\text{max}}}
$$

Now, we are told that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, or equivalently $ R_{\text{min}}/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 $, and that the final answer should be **in terms of $ G $, $ M $, and $ r $** — **not** involving $ R_{\text{max}} $.

Therefore, we can **neglect** the term $ \frac{GM}{2 R_{\text{max}}} $ compared to $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, because $ R_{\text{max}} \gg r \Rightarrow 1/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1/r $.

Hence, in the limit $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $ (or practically, since the starting orbit is very far out), the energy released per unit mass is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

$$

The disc is stationary, geometrically thin, and we ignore self-gravity of the disc.

### Step 1: Understand the total mechanical energy in a Keplerian orbit

For a test mass (or gas element) in a **circular Keplerian orbit** around a central mass $ M $, the **specific mechanical energy** (i.e., energy per unit mass) is the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy:

- Gravitational potential energy per unit mass:  
  $$ U = -\frac{GM}{r} $$

- Orbital speed in a circular Keplerian orbit:  
  $$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Kinetic energy per unit mass} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} $$

- So total specific mechanical energy:
  $$
  \varepsilon(r) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
  $$

This is a standard result: **the specific orbital energy in a circular Keplerian orbit is $ -\frac{GM}{2r} $**.

---

### Step 2: Determine energy released during inward migration

The gas starts at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ and spirals in slowly to radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $. Because the process is slow (quasi-static), the gas remains in **near-circular orbits** at all times, so its mechanical energy at any radius is given by the above expression.

As the gas moves inward, **mechanical energy decreases** (becomes more negative), and the **difference in energy is radiated away** (via viscous dissipation).

So, the **energy released per unit mass** is the **loss** in mechanical energy:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r)
$$

Note: Since $ \varepsilon(r) < \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) < 0 $, this difference is **positive**, representing energy released.

Now plug in the expressions:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right) = \frac{GM}{2r} - \frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}}
$$

But the problem states that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, or equivalently $ R_{\text{min}}/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 $, and we are to give the answer **in terms of $ G, M, r $** only.

That implies we can **neglect the term $ \frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} $** compared to $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, since $ R_{\text{max}} \gg r $.

Thus, in the limit $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $ (or just $ R_{\text{max}} \gg r $):

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

However, **wait**: this seems counterintuitive. Let's double-check the direction of energy release.

- At large radius, energy per unit mass ≈ 0 (from below).
- At small radius, energy per unit mass is large negative.
- So the system **loses** mechanical energy; that energy is **radiated away**.
- Therefore, **energy released** = **initial energy – final energy** = (less negative) – (more negative) = **positive**.

Yes, so the expression is correct.

But hold on! In standard accretion disc theory, the **total energy radiated** as a particle falls from infinity to radius $ r $ is indeed $ \frac{GM}{2r} $. However, if it starts at finite $ R_{\text{max}} $, then it's slightly less.

But the problem says: ""find the expression [...] in terms of G, M and r"", and also that $ R_{\text{min}}/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 $, and we're evaluating the energy released **from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $**.

So under the approximation $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $, or $ 1/R_{\text{max}} \to 0 $, we drop that term.

Hence, the **total mechanical energy per unit mass released** is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{GM}{2r}}
$$

But wait again — let’s consider: is this the energy **released**, or the **binding energy** at radius $ r $? Yes, the binding energy at $ r $ is $ \frac{GM}{2r} $, which is the energy released going from infinity to $ r $. Since $ R_{\text{max}} \gg r $, it's approximately the same.

Therefore, the answer is:

> **$\displaystyle \frac{GM}{2r}$**

✅ This matches standard results in accretion disc theory: the specific energy radiated by material accreting from far away to radius $ r $ is $ GM/(2r) $.

Assuming that an element of gas in the disc follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit,","We are asked to find the **total mechanical energy per unit mass** released by a gas element as it moves from an initial circular orbit at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ down to a final circular orbit at radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, in a **Keplerian accretion disc** around a compact object of mass $ M $. The process is slow (quasi-static), and the disc is geometrically thin. Viscous stresses allow the gas to lose angular momentum and spiral inward, converting mechanical energy into heat (radiated away). We are to compute the **specific energy** (energy per unit mass) **released**, i.e., the **difference in mechanical energy per unit mass** between the two orbits.

---

### Step 1: Mechanical energy of a test mass in a Keplerian circular orbit

For a particle of mass $ \Delta m $ in a circular orbit of radius $ r $ around a central mass $ M $, the **specific mechanical energy** (total energy per unit mass) is:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = \frac{E}{m} = \text{kinetic energy per unit mass} + \text{gravitational potential energy per unit mass}
$$

In a Keplerian orbit:

- Gravitational potential energy per unit mass:  
  $$
  U(r) = -\frac{GM}{r}
  $$

- Orbital speed from centripetal force balance:  
  $$
  \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
  $$

- Kinetic energy per unit mass:  
  $$
  K(r) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r}
  $$

So total specific mechanical energy:

$$
\varepsilon(r) = K(r) + U(r) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{GM}{r} = -\frac{GM}{2r}
$$

This is a standard result for circular Keplerian orbits.

---

### Step 2: Energy released per unit mass when moving from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $

As the gas moves inward from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ r $, its mechanical energy **decreases** (becomes more negative), and the **difference** is **released** (via viscous dissipation and radiated away).

Thus, the **energy released per unit mass** is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r)
= \left( -\frac{GM}{2R_{\text{max}}} \right) - \left( -\frac{GM}{2r} \right)
= \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

Given that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, we can approximate:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \ll \frac{1}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \approx \frac{1}{r}
$$

However, the problem asks for the expression **from the moment it starts orbiting at radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ until it reaches radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $** — so unless instructed to take the limit $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $, we should keep both terms. But note: in accretion disc theory, often the gas is assumed to start from rest at infinity, but here it **starts orbiting at $ R_{\text{max}} $**, so it already has orbital energy.

But the question says: ""find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} $ released by this gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $ R_{\text{max}} $ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $.""

So the exact expression is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right) }
$$

However, if we consider the typical case where the gas eventually reaches the **innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)**, denoted $ R_{\text{min}} $, and if the problem intends $ r = R_{\text{min}} $, then the energy released from $ R_{\text{max}} $ to $ R_{\text{min}} $ is:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} = \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{min}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right)
$$

But the problem states: ""until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $"", and also mentions $ R_{\text{min}} $ as the minimum stable orbital radius. So likely, they want the general expression down to some small radius $ r $, possibly $ R_{\text{min}} $, but since they use $ r $ in the question, we keep it as $ r $.

Also, the problem says: ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r"". Wait — let's re-read:

> ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r.""

But also mentions $ R_{\text{max}} $. However, if $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, then $ 1/R_{\text{max}} \approx 0 $, so to leading order:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m} \approx \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

But is that the energy **released**? Wait: the energy **released** is the **loss** of mechanical energy, which is **positive**. Since the gas ends up with more negative energy, the system **loses** mechanical energy, which is **radiated away**. So yes, the amount **released** is $ \varepsilon_{\text{initial}} - \varepsilon_{\text{final}} > 0 $.

Now, the problem says: ""such as neutron stars and black holes, is one of the most efficient ways to produce radiant energy... minimum stable orbital radius of $ R_{\text{min}} $ (with $ R_{\text{min}}/R_{\text{max}} \ll 1 $)"".

So perhaps they actually want the energy released from $ R_{\text{max}} $ down to $ R_{\text{min}} $, and since $ R_{\text{min}} \ll R_{\text{max}} $, we can neglect $ 1/R_{\text{max}} $. But the question explicitly says: ""until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $"", and uses $ r $, not necessarily $ R_{\text{min}} $.

But then it says: ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r."" — Note: **R_max is not listed**. That suggests we are to **neglect** the $ 1/R_{\text{max}} $ term.

Therefore, under the approximation $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} \Rightarrow 1/R_{\text{max}} \to 0 $, the energy per unit mass released is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }
$$

But wait! Let’s double-check physical intuition: Is the total energy **released** equal to $ GM/(2r) $? That would be the case if the gas started from **infinitely far away at rest**, but that’s not correct — because from infinity at rest, the total energy is zero, and if it ends in a circular orbit at $ r $, its energy is $ -GM/(2r) $, so the energy released would be $ 0 - (-GM/(2r)) = GM/(2r) $. But in our case, the gas **starts in a circular orbit at $ R_{\text{max}} $**, so it already has energy $ -GM/(2R_{\text{max}}) $. So the energy released is less than $ GM/(2r) $ by $ GM/(2R_{\text{max}}) $.

However, the problem says: ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r"", implying **do not include $ R_{\text{max}} $**. And given that $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, the term $ 1/R_{\text{max}} $ is negligible.

Thus, the **approximate expression** for the energy per unit mass released is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }
$$

But hold on! In standard accretion disc theory, the **total energy radiated** as a parcel of gas moves from large radius to radius $ r $ is **not** just the difference in orbital energy, because **half** of the gravitational potential energy released goes into kinetic energy, and **half** is radiated (for a slowly evolving disc). But actually, the **local** energy dissipation rate is such that the **total** energy radiated from infinity down to ISCO is indeed $ GM/(6R_s) $ for Schwarzschild black hole (where $ R_{\text{ISCO}} = 6GM/c^2 $), which corresponds to efficiency ~5.7%. But that’s GR.

However, in **Newtonian** gravity, for a Keplerian disc, the **total energy radiated** as gas moves from $ R_{\text{max}} \to r $ **is equal to the change in mechanical energy**, because the loss of mechanical energy must go somewhere — and in a steady-state thin disc, it's radiated away. So yes, the energy radiated per unit mass is $ \Delta \varepsilon = \varepsilon(R_{\text{max}}) - \varepsilon(r) $.

So again, exact answer: $ \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right) $

Approximate answer (since $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $): $ \frac{GM}{2r} $

But now, read the problem again carefully:

> ""find the expression for the total mechanical energy per unit mass $\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta m}$ released by this gas from the moment it starts orbiting at a radius $R_{max}$ until the moment it reaches an orbit of radius r ≪ $R_{max}$""

> ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r.""

It **does not mention** $ R_{\text{max}} $ in the final answer instruction, and emphasizes $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, so we are to **neglect** the initial energy (i.e., assume $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $, or $ 1/R_{\text{max}} \to 0 $).

Therefore, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }
$$

But wait once more: is this the energy **released** or the **binding energy** at radius $ r $? The binding energy at $ r $ is $ GM/(2r) $, and if the gas started from rest at infinity, that’s the energy released. But here, it starts in orbit at $ R_{\text{max}} $, so strictly speaking, the energy released is slightly less. However, given the problem's instruction and approximation, we go with the simplified form.

Alternatively, maybe they expect the **exact** expression, and the phrase ""in terms of G, M, and r"" might be incomplete — but it explicitly says **""and r""**, not mentioning $ R_{\text{max}} $, so likely they want the approximation.

However, another interpretation: perhaps the gas **starts at rest at $ R_{\text{max}} $**, but the problem says: ""starts orbiting at a radius $ R_{\text{max}} $"", and ""assuming that an element of gas in the disc follows an approximately Keplerian circular orbit"", so it **is** in a circular orbit at $ R_{\text{max}} $.

Given all that, I think the **most defensible answer** that matches the problem's wording and instruction is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{max}}} \right) }
$$

But this includes $ R_{\text{max}} $, which the problem says not to include. Hmm.

Wait — re-reading the very end:

> ""give your final answer in terms of G,The accretion of matter onto compact objects,""

This seems like a **corrupted sentence**. Probably a copy-paste error. The original instruction likely was: ""give your final answer in terms of G, M, and r.""

Given that, and the condition $ r \ll R_{\text{max}} $, the standard approach in astrophysics is to **approximate** the energy released as the binding energy at radius $ r $, i.e., $ GM/(2r) $.

But actually, in many textbooks (e.g., Frank, King & Raine), the **total energy radiated** per unit mass as gas moves from large radius to radius $ r $ is:

$$
\Delta \varepsilon = \frac{GM}{2r}
$$

in the limit $ R_{\text{max}} \to \infty $.

Thus, accepting the approximation, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{GM}{2r} }

Joining the expressions found, we obtain: ${S}_{2} = D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{2{S}_{1}c}{{2c} - {S}_{1}{H}_{0}}$

$D\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{\frac{{4D}{c}^{2}}{{2c} - D{H}_{0}}}{{2c} - \frac{2Dc}{{2c} - D{H}_{0}} \cdot  {H}_{0}}$

$\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right)  = \frac{2c}{{2c} - D{H}_{0} - D{H}_{0}} = \frac{c}{c - D{H}_{0}}$

$c = \left( {1 + \frac{1}{2}{H}_{0}T}\right) \left( {c - D{H}_{0}}\right)= c - D{H}_{0} + \frac{1}{2}c{H}_{0}T - \frac{1}{2}D{H}_{0}^{2}T$

$0 = \frac{{H}_{0}}{2}\left( {{cT} - {2D} - D{H}_{0}T}\right)$

Conclude: 

${H}_{0} = \frac{{cT} - {2D}}{DT}$","We are asked to find an expression for the Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in a **Steady-State Universe** model, based on a thought experiment involving a mirror placed at a distance $ D $, and a laser beam sent from Earth that returns after time $ T $. The key assumption given is that the separation $ S(t) $ between the Solar System and the mirror evolves according to:

$$
S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
$$

where:
- $ s $ is the initial separation at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the (constant) Hubble parameter in this Steady-State model,
- The universe expands exponentially with time.

However, note that the problem says: *""the mirror [...] would be placed at a distance $ D $ from the Solar System""*. This likely means that **at the time the laser is emitted**, the distance to the mirror is $ D $. So we can identify $ s = D $, i.e., at $ t = 0 $, $ S(0) = D $.

Now, the laser is emitted at $ t = 0 $, travels toward the mirror, reflects, and returns at time $ t = T $. Because the universe is expanding, the mirror is receding during the light’s travel. Thus, the light does **not** simply travel a distance $ 2D $ at speed $ c $, because the mirror moves away while the light is in transit.

We must compute the round-trip travel time $ T $ of a light signal in an exponentially expanding universe where proper distance evolves as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

But caution: In cosmology, light propagation is governed by the metric, and proper distance is not simply traversed at speed $ c $ when space itself is expanding. However, the problem seems to adopt a **simplified Newtonian-like picture**, where the separation increases as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and light moves through this changing separation at speed $ c $ **relative to local space** — but since it's a flat, fully reflecting mirror in a region without gravity, and the problem gives us this law explicitly, we are to use it directly in a kinematic way.

Let’s proceed carefully.

---

### Step 1: Outbound journey

Let the light be emitted at $ t = 0 $ from Earth. Let $ t_1 $ be the time when it reaches the mirror.

At any time $ t $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $ from Earth.

But the light is moving toward the mirror at speed $ c $, while the mirror is receding. However, in an expanding universe, light doesn't obey simple relative velocity addition. But again, the problem gives us a specific law and likely expects a simplified treatment.

Alternative approach: Use the fact that in this model, the **proper distance** between Earth and mirror is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $. For light moving radially in such a universe, the proper distance it covers is affected by expansion.

But wait — the problem says: *""Consider that the separation $ S $ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe from the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $""*, and that the mirror maintains its spatial orientation via gyroscopes, and is in a region without gravitational influences.

This suggests that the mirror is **comoving** with the Hubble flow — i.e., it's not propelled; it just sits in the expanding universe, so its proper distance grows as $ D e^{H_0 t} $.

In standard cosmology, for a photon traveling in an expanding universe, the comoving distance it travels is given by integrating $ c dt / a(t) $, where $ a(t) $ is the scale factor.

In this Steady-State model, the expansion is exponential: $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, so the Hubble parameter is constant.

Thus, the metric is de Sitter-like: $ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a^2(t) d\vec{x}^2 $, with $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $.

For radial null geodesics (light), $ ds = 0 $, so:

$$
c dt = a(t) dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad dx = \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = c e^{-H_0 t} dt
$$

The comoving distance to the mirror is fixed (since it's comoving), say $ x_m $. At emission ($ t = 0 $), the proper distance is $ D = a(0) x_m = x_m $, since $ a(0) = 1 $ (we can set that normalization). So $ x_m = D $.

Then, the time $ t_1 $ for light to reach the mirror satisfies:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Compute the integral:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D
$$

Solve for $ t_1 $:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c} \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{-H_0 t_1} = 1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Take logarithm:

$$
t_1 = -\frac{1}{H_0} \ln\left(1 - \frac{H_0 D}{c} \right)
$$

This requires $ H_0 D < c $, which is reasonable (mirror within Hubble radius).

---

### Step 2: Return journey

After reflection at time $ t_1 $, the light travels back to Earth. Now, Earth is at comoving coordinate 0, and the photon must travel comoving distance $ D $ back.

But now, the photon is moving opposite direction, but the integral is the same: the comoving distance is $ D $, and the time taken from $ t_1 $ to $ T $ must satisfy:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
$$

Wait — is that correct?

Actually, no. On the return trip, the photon is moving toward decreasing comoving coordinate, but the magnitude of comoving distance is still $ D $. However, the scale factor is larger during return, so the relation between proper and comoving distance changes.

But actually, the comoving distance between Earth and mirror is always $ D $, so both outbound and inbound trips cover comoving distance $ D $. However, the **time** taken for each leg is **not symmetric** because $ a(t) $ is increasing.

But careful: On the outbound trip, the photon moves from $ x=0 $ to $ x=D $, and the condition is:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = D
$$

On the return trip, it moves from $ x=D $ to $ x=0 $, so:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = D
$$

So **both integrals equal $ D $**. Therefore, the total comoving distance traveled is $ 2D $, and:

$$
\int_0^{T} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = 2D
$$

Since $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, we have:

$$
\int_0^{T} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = 2D
$$

Compute:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

Thus,

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $.

This is a transcendental equation. But the problem says: *""You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, if necessary.""*

This suggests that $ H_0 T \ll 1 $ and $ H_0 D / c \ll 1 $, i.e., the experiment occurs over times much less than the Hubble time, so expansion is small.

Apply approximation.

First, expand $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \cdots $

Then:

Left-hand side: $ 1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} + \cdots $

Right-hand side: $ \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} $

To first order (neglecting quadratic terms):

$$
H_0 T \approx \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ H_0 $:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

But that’s just the static result! That can’t determine $ H_0 $ — the first-order expansion cancels $ H_0 $.

So we need to go to **next order** to get a measurable effect.

Let’s do that.

Use expansion up to second order:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2}
$$

So:

$$
H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
\frac{H_0 T^2}{2} = T - \frac{2D}{c}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right)
= \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait — is this consistent? Let's check dimensions: $ H_0 $ has units of 1/time. Yes.

However, note that in the static case (no expansion), $ T_0 = 2D/c $. So define $ \Delta T = T - T_0 = T - 2D/c $. Then:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2 \Delta T}{T^2}
$$

But the problem asks for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D, c, T $. So the above expression is acceptable **under the small-expansion approximation**.

But let’s double-check the logic.

Alternative approach: Use the exact equation:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

This is the exact relation. Can we solve this for $ H_0 $? Not algebraically — it's transcendental.

But the problem says ""Find an expression for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D, c, T $"", and allows the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $.

However, as we saw, first-order gives no info. So perhaps the problem assumes a **different model** — maybe not using comoving coordinates, but a naive kinematic model where the distance increases as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and light moves at speed $ c $ relative to Earth, so the outbound light closes the gap at speed $ c - v(t) $, where $ v(t) = dS/dt = H_0 S(t) $.

But that’s not how light works in relativity — light always moves at $ c $ locally. However, the problem might be using a **Newtonian approximation** for pedagogical purposes.

Let’s try that naive approach.

### Naive (non-cosmological) approach:

Assume that at time $ t $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

Outbound: Light leaves Earth at $ t=0 $, position $ x=0 $. Mirror position: $ x_m(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $.

Light position: $ x_\text{light}(t) = c t $.

They meet when $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} $.

Similarly, on return: after reflection at $ t_1 $, light travels back: its position is $ x = c t_1 - c (t - t_1) = 2 c t_1 - c t $.

Earth is at $ x = 0 $. But Earth is not moving in this picture — only mirror moves.

So return time $ T $ satisfies: $ 2 c t_1 - c T = 0 \Rightarrow T = 2 t_1 $.

But from outbound: $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \Rightarrow t_1 = \frac{D}{c} e^{H_0 t_1} $

This is implicit. And $ T = 2 t_1 $, so:

$$
\frac{c T}{2} = D e^{H_0 T / 2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{c T}{2 D} = e^{H_0 T / 2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right) = \frac{H_0 T}{2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

This is a clean expression!

Now, check consistency: If no expansion ($ H_0 = 0 $), then $ S(t) = D $, so $ T = 2D/c $. Plug into RHS:

$ \frac{c T}{2D} = 1 \Rightarrow \ln(1) = 0 \Rightarrow H_0 = 0 $. Good.

Now, is this model what the problem intends?

The problem states: *""the separation $ S $ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe from the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $""*, and that the laser is sent from Earth, reflects, and returns after time $ T $.

It does **not** mention comoving coordinates or cosmological null geodesics. It seems to treat $ S(t) $ as the physical distance at time $ t $, and likely assumes that light travels at speed $ c $ through space, covering distance relative to Earth.

But in reality, in expanding space, you can't just say light position is $ ct $, because space stretches. However, for **small distances and slow expansion**, the difference between the two models is small.

Moreover, the naive model yields an explicit solvable expression, while the cosmological model gives a transcendental equation that only yields $ H_0 $ approximately.

Given that the problem provides the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $ and asks for $ H_0(D, c, T) $, and mentions using $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ if needed, it's likely expecting the **naive kinematic model**.

Let’s test the approximation.

From the naive result:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

Now, if expansion is small, then $ T \approx 2D/c + \delta T $, so $ \frac{c T}{2D} = 1 + \epsilon $, with $ \epsilon \ll 1 $.

Then $ \ln(1 + \epsilon) \approx \epsilon $, so:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \cdot \left( \frac{c T}{2D} - 1 \right) = \frac{2}{T} \left( \frac{c T - 2D}{2D} \right) = \frac{c T - 2D}{D T}
$$

Alternatively, $ H_0 \approx \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T} $

But earlier, from the cosmological approach (second order), we had:

$ H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2} $

These are different. So the models disagree.

Which one is intended?

Let’s re-read: *""the separation $ S $ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $ S=se^{H_{0}t} $, where $ s $ is the initial separation.""*

And: *""a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time $ T $, the radiation would return and be detected""*

Key: The mirror is **placed at distance $ D $** — this is likely the initial separation $ s = D $.

Now, in the **Steady-State Universe**, the perfect cosmological principle holds, and the expansion is exponential with constant $ H_0 $. The standard metric is indeed de Sitter, and light propagation follows null geodesics.

However, the problem is probably designed for an **introductory-level derivation**, using the given law $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and assuming that the light takes time $ t_1 $ to reach the mirror, during which the mirror moves, and the light must cover the instantaneous distance.

But light doesn't work that way — its travel is continuous.

Better method in naive physics: The time for light to reach the mirror satisfies:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c \, dt = \int_0^{t_1} \frac{dS}{dt} dt + D = S(t_1) - D + D = S(t_1)
$$

No, that’s not right.

Actually, the correct naive differential equation is:

The rate at which the distance between light and mirror decreases is $ c - v(t) $, where $ v(t) = dS/dt = H_0 S(t) $.

But the light starts at 0, mirror at $ D $. Let $ L(t) $ be distance between light pulse and mirror at time $ t $. Then:

$ \frac{dL}{dt} = v(t) - c = H_0 S(t) - c $, but $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and $ L(t) = S(t) - c t $, so set $ L(t_1) = 0 $:

$ D e^{H_0 t_1} - c t_1 = 0 \Rightarrow c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} $

Same as before.

So the meeting condition is $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} $.

Then return trip: assuming Earth is fixed, light returns at speed $ c $, so return time is $ t_1 $, total $ T = 2 t_1 $. But is that valid?

During return, the Earth is not moving, but the space is expanding — however, in this naive model, we assume Earth is fixed, mirror moves, light moves at $ c $ relative to Earth.

So yes, return time is $ t_1 $, so $ T = 2 t_1 $.

Thus, $ c (T/2) = D e^{H_0 T / 2} $

So:

$$
\frac{c T}{2 D} = e^{H_0 T / 2}
\Rightarrow
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

This is a clean, exact expression under the given assumptions.

Now, the problem says: ""You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, if necessary.""

If we apply that to $ e^{H_0 T / 2} \approx 1 + H_0 T / 2 $, then:

$ \frac{c T}{2 D} \approx 1 + \frac{H_0 T}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{c T}{2 D} - 1 \approx \frac{H_0 T}{2} \Rightarrow H_0 \approx \frac{c T - 2 D}{D T} $

But the problem doesn’t say we must approximate — it says ""if necessary"". Since we can solve exactly in this model, we can give the exact expression.

Therefore, the answer is:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

But wait — dimensionally, argument of log must be dimensionless. $ c T $ has units of distance, $ D $ is distance, so $ c T / (2 D) $ is dimensionless. OK.

Also, for $ T > 2D/c $, the log is positive, so $ H_0 > 0 $, which makes sense: expansion increases travel time.

If the universe were contracting, $ H_0 < 0 $, and $ T < 2D/c $.

So this makes physical sense.

Now, is there any flaw?

One might argue that on the return trip, the expansion also affects the return time — in the naive model, we assumed return time equals outbound time, but actually, during return, the Earth is ""receding"" from the light in an expanding universe? No — in this model, Earth is at fixed location, only mirror moves due to expansion. But in a homogeneous expansion, **both** Earth and mirror should be comoving, so the distance between them increases, but neither is ""fixed"".

Ah! This is critical.

In a real expanding universe, **both** the Solar System and the mirror are comoving with the Hubble flow. So there is no preferred ""fixed"" location. The proper distance between them is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, assuming at $ t=0 $, $ S(0) = D $.

Therefore, during the light’s travel, **both ends are moving apart**. But in the photon’s frame, it always moves at $ c $ locally.

However, in the **comoving coordinate approach**, we already did the correct calculation and got:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

But this assumes that the comoving distance is $ D $, and $ a(0) = 1 $, so proper distance at $ t=0 $ is $ D $.

This is the physically correct approach in cosmology.

Now, solve this for $ H_0 $:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

This cannot be solved analytically for $ H_0 $. But the problem asks to ""find an expression"", and allows approximation.

Earlier, we saw that first-order cancels, but second-order gives:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But let’s re-derive carefully.

Start from:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

Expand $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} - \frac{(H_0 T)^3}{6} + \cdots $

Then:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} \approx H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} + \frac{(H_0 T)^3}{6} - \cdots
$$

So:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} \left( H_0 T - \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} + \cdots \right) = c \left( T - \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} + \cdots \right) = 2D
$$

Thus:

$$
c T - \frac{c H_0 T^2}{2} \approx 2D
\Rightarrow
\frac{c H_0 T^2}{2} \approx c T - 2D
\Rightarrow
H_0 \approx \frac{2(c T - 2D)}{c T^2} = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

Same as before.

Now, compare to naive model approximated:

Naive: $ H_0 \approx \frac{c T - 2D}{D T} $

These are different functions.

Which one is intended?

The problem mentions ""Steady-State Universe"", which historically uses the **perfect cosmological principle**, and the expansion is described by $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $. In that context, the correct treatment is the **cosmological one** with comoving coordinates.

However, the problem also says: ""the separation $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $"", which is the proper distance between two comoving objects.

And for light propagation, the correct equation is the integral of $ dt/a(t) $.

But here's a key point: In the **round-trip**, the light goes to the mirror and back. But in an **expanding universe**, the return trip is affected by expansion **after** reflection. However, in our earlier comoving calculation, we assumed that the mirror is at fixed comoving coordinate $ D $, and Earth at 0, so both legs take the same comoving distance, hence the total integral is $ 2D $.

But is that valid for **reflection**? When the light reflects, it reverses direction in comoving coordinates, yes.

So the calculation seems sound.

But then, why does the problem give the law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $ instead of the scale factor? Probably to avoid introducing $ a(t) $.

Maybe they expect us to consider that the distance at time $ t $ is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and that the light's travel time is determined by integrating the changing distance.

Another way: The time for light to go from Earth to mirror is given by solving:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c dt = \int_0^{t_1} \frac{d}{dt} [D e^{H_0 t}] dt + D ??
$$

No.

Perhaps the problem is **unsolvable** because in a Steady-State Universe, you cannot have a fixed mirror at a fixed proper distance — everything is expanding, so you can't ""place"" a mirror at distance $ D $ and have it stay in the Hubble flow unless it's comoving, which it is.

But the main issue: **In a truly homogeneous expanding universe, a round-trip light signal to a comoving mirror will never return if the expansion is exponential and the mirror is beyond the Hubble sphere.** But for nearby mirrors, it can.

However, the problem states the mirror is placed at distance $ D $, and the light returns after time $ T $, so we assume it's within the horizon.

Given all this, and that the problem allows approximation, but also asks for an expression, I think the **intended solution** is the naive one, because:

- It yields an explicit expression.
- The problem gives $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $ as the separation law, implying that at time $ t $, the distance is that.
- It doesn't mention comoving coordinates or integrate $ dt/a $.
- It's a thought experiment by a ""bored cosmologist"", suggesting a simplified model.

Moreover, in many introductory treatments, the Doppler shift or light travel time in expanding universe is sometimes modeled with $ v = H_0 D $, etc.

But here's a decisive point: In the **outbound journey**, the light is chasing a receding mirror. The condition is that the light's path length equals the integrated motion.

But in relativity, light always moves at $ c $, so the proper distance it covers is not simply $ ct $.

However, for **small $ H_0 $**, the two models converge in leading correction.

But the problem says ""Find an expression"", not ""Find an approximate expression"", and gives an exact law $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $.

Given that, and the fact that using the meeting condition $ c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} $ is direct from the given law (interpreting $ D e^{H_0 t} $ as the position of the mirror, and $ ct $ as position of light), and total time $ T = 2 t_1 $, then:

$$
H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

I think this is the expected answer.

Thus, final answer:

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)}
$$","Let the constant (A = 1) be set, but it is not used in subsequent calculations.。A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time $T$, the radiation would return and be detected, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $H_0$.

Find an expression for $H_0$ as a function of $D,c$ (speed of light) and $T$. Consider that the separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation. You may use $e^x\approx1+x$ for $x\ll1$, if necessary.。Let the variance of the random variable be (σ² = 0).。","We are given a thought experiment in a **Steady-State Universe**, where the separation between two comoving objects (the Solar System and a distant mirror) increases due to cosmic expansion according to:

$$
S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
$$

Here:
- $ s $ is the initial separation at time $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant (assumed constant in steady-state cosmology),
- $ c $ is the speed of light,
- A laser is sent from Earth at time $ t = 0 $ toward a mirror initially at distance $ D $, so $ s = D $,
- The light travels to the mirror and reflects back; the total round-trip time is measured as $ T $,
- Due to cosmic expansion, the mirror is moving away during the light's travel, so the return time is affected.

We are to find an expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ c $, and $ T $, using the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, which implies we assume $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, i.e., small expansion over the travel time.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In an expanding universe with scale factor $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $ (since in steady-state cosmology, the scale factor grows exponentially), the proper distance between comoving objects is $ S(t) = s e^{H_0 t} $. However, **light does not simply travel at speed $ c $ relative to this expanding distance**—we must account for the fact that while light is in transit, the mirror is receding.

But note: the problem **explicitly gives** the law for separation as $ S(t) = s e^{H_0 t} $, and says the separation increases **only due to expansion**, and that the mirror maintains fixed spatial orientation (so no peculiar motion). So we can model the motion of the mirror as having a recession velocity given by:

$$
v(t) = \frac{dS}{dt} = H_0 s e^{H_0 t} = H_0 S(t)
$$

This is consistent with Hubble's law.

However, for light propagation in an expanding universe, one usually integrates null geodesics: $ c dt = a(t) dr $, etc. But the problem seems to suggest a **simpler Newtonian-like approach**, possibly because it’s a thought experiment and uses the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $. So perhaps we are to treat the problem **as if** the mirror is moving away with velocity $ v = H_0 D $ (approximately constant), and compute the light travel time accordingly.

But let's proceed carefully.

---

### Step 2: Model the outbound and return light travel times

Let:
- $ t_1 $ = time for light to reach the mirror,
- $ t_2 = T - t_1 $ = time for reflected light to return to Earth.

During the outbound trip (from $ t = 0 $ to $ t = t_1 $), the light is chasing a receding mirror whose position at time $ t $ is:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

The light leaves Earth at $ t=0 $ from position 0, and moves at speed $ c $ **through space**, but in an expanding universe, the correct way is to consider that the light's **proper distance traveled** is affected by expansion. However, again, the problem may be assuming a **local inertial frame** where distances are proper distances and light moves at $ c $ relative to local space, but the mirror is moving away with velocity determined by Hubble's law.

Given the instruction to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, we assume $ H_0 t \ll 1 $, so expansion is small over the duration of the experiment. Therefore, we can approximate the mirror’s motion as **uniform recession** with approximately constant velocity:

$$
S(t) \approx D(1 + H_0 t)
$$

So the mirror's velocity is approximately:

$$
v \approx \frac{dS}{dt} = D H_0
$$

(Actually, derivative of $ D(1 + H_0 t) $ is $ D H_0 $, yes.)

Now, for the **outbound journey**: light moves at speed $ c $, mirror moves away at speed $ v = D H_0 $. But wait — this velocity is not constant! Because in reality, $ v(t) = H_0 D e^{H_0 t} \approx H_0 D (1 + H_0 t) $, but to first order, $ v \approx H_0 D $, constant.

However, even better: instead of assuming constant velocity, integrate the exact condition for light catching up to the mirror.

But maybe even simpler: use the **first-order approximation** for total round-trip time.

---

### Step 3: Use first-order approximation for total time

Assume that without expansion ($ H_0 = 0 $), the round-trip time would be:

$$
T_0 = \frac{2D}{c}
$$

With small expansion, the mirror moves slightly farther during the light’s travel, so the actual time $ T > T_0 $. We want to compute the correction to first order in $ H_0 $, then solve for $ H_0 $.

Let’s denote:

- Outbound: light leaves at $ t = 0 $, arrives at mirror at $ t = t_1 $
- During this time, the mirror’s position is $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \approx D(1 + H_0 t) $
- The light travels a distance $ c t_1 $, which must equal the mirror’s position at $ t_1 $:

$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)
$$

Solve for $ t_1 $ to first order in $ H_0 $:

$$
c t_1 \approx D + D H_0 t_1 \\
\Rightarrow c t_1 - D H_0 t_1 \approx D \\
\Rightarrow t_1 (c - D H_0) \approx D \\
\Rightarrow t_1 \approx \frac{D}{c - D H_0} \approx \frac{D}{c} \left(1 + \frac{D H_0}{c} \right)
$$

(using $ 1/(1 - x) \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $)

Similarly, for the return trip: the light is reflected at $ t = t_1 $ from position $ S(t_1) \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1) $, and travels back to Earth. But now, **Earth is not moving** in this picture? Wait — in the Steady-State model, both Earth and mirror are comoving, so **both are receding from each other**. However, since we’re measuring distance from Earth, and Earth is our origin, we can treat Earth as fixed at proper distance 0, and mirror moving away.

But on the return trip, the light is moving toward Earth, while the ""starting point"" of the return trip is at distance $ S(t_1) \approx D(1 + H_0 t_1) $, and during the return time $ t_2 $, the light covers that distance **while space continues to expand**. However, once the light is reflected, it just travels through space toward Earth; the expansion affects the distance it must cover only insofar as the path lengthens during travel. But again, to first order, we can approximate.

Alternatively, note that on the return trip, the light is moving toward Earth, and there is no ""target moving away""—Earth is at fixed proper coordinate (we’re in Earth’s local frame). But actually, in proper distance coordinates, if the mirror is at $ S(t_1) $, then as light returns, the proper distance between light and Earth decreases at rate $ c $, **but new space is being created between them**, so effectively, the light’s closing speed is less than $ c $??

This is getting into subtleties of expanding space.

But perhaps the problem intends a **simpler Doppler-like approach**: the total path length is increased due to expansion, and to first order, the extra distance is accounted for by integrating the recession.

However, there's a well-known result in cosmology for **radar distance** in a slowly expanding universe: the round-trip light travel time satisfies:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 H_0 D^2}{c^2}
$$

Let’s derive that.

---

### Step 4: Derive total time to first order

Use the exact equation for outbound trip:

Light moves at speed $ c $, so in infinitesimal time $ dt $, it covers proper distance $ c dt $. But during that time, the mirror’s proper distance increases. However, the correct way in a FLRW universe is to use comoving coordinates.

Let’s do it properly with comoving coordinates.

Let the scale factor be $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $. In a flat universe, the proper distance is $ S(t) = a(t) \chi $, where $ \chi $ is comoving distance.

At emission ($ t = 0 $), the mirror is at proper distance $ D $, so its comoving distance is:

$$
\chi = \frac{D}{a(0)} = D \quad (\text{since } a(0) = 1)
$$

The mirror remains at fixed $ \chi = D $ (comoving).

Outbound light follows null geodesic:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = \chi = D
$$

So:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D \\
\Rightarrow \frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D \\
\Rightarrow 1 - e^{-H_0 t_1} = \frac{H_0 D}{c}
$$

Similarly, for the return trip: light leaves mirror at $ t = t_1 $, arrives at Earth at $ t = T $. The comoving distance is again $ D $, so:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c dt}{a(t)} = D \\
\Rightarrow \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}) = D
$$

Add both equations:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D \\
\Rightarrow 1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now, this is an exact relation in this exponential expansion model.

We are to solve for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D, c, T $. So:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

This is a transcendental equation. But we are told to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, i.e., $ H_0 T \ll 1 $. Then:

Left side: $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T $

Right side: $ 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} $

So:

$$
1 - H_0 T \approx 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Cancel 1:

$$
- H_0 T \approx - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ -H_0 $:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Wait—that gives no information about $ H_0 $! That suggests that **to first order**, the expansion does not affect the round-trip time in this model? But that contradicts intuition.

Ah—but note: in the derivation above, we used the **comoving coordinate method**, which is correct for FLRW. However, in **steady-state cosmology**, which assumes continuous creation of matter and perfect cosmological principle, the expansion is exponential, and radar distance indeed has this property.

But let’s double-check the integrals.

Outbound: light goes from $ \chi = 0 $ to $ \chi = D $. Null geodesic: $ d\chi = c dt / a(t) $. So:

$$
D = \int_0^{t_1} \frac{c dt}{e^{H_0 t}} = \frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})
$$

Return: light goes from $ \chi = D $ to $ \chi = 0 $, so:

$$
D = \int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c dt}{e^{H_0 t}} = \frac{c}{H_0}(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})
$$

Add: total:

$$
2D = \frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) \Rightarrow e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Now expand both sides to **second order**, because first order cancels.

Expand left: $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} $

Right: $ 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c} $

So:

$$
1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} \approx 1 - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Cancel 1:

$$
- H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} \approx - \frac{2 H_0 D}{c}
$$

Divide both sides by $ H_0 $ (assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $):

$$
- T + \frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx - \frac{2 D}{c}
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\frac{H_0 T^2}{2} \approx T - \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Thus:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right ) = \frac{2}{T} - \frac{4D}{c T^2}
$$

But wait—is this valid? It requires knowing $ D $, but in practice, $ D $ is not directly measurable; however, in this thought experiment, the cosmologist **places** the mirror at distance $ D $, so $ D $ is known.

But the problem says: “Find an expression for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D, c, T $.” So this is acceptable.

However, note that if expansion is zero, $ T = 2D/c $, so the term in parentheses is zero, as expected.

But the problem says: “You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, if necessary.” That is a **first-order** approximation. But as we saw, first-order gives no info. So perhaps they expect us to consider the mirror’s motion classically.

Alternative approach: **Newtonian approximation with instantaneous recession velocity**.

Assume that during the light’s travel, the mirror moves with velocity $ v = H_0 D $, constant.

Then:

- Outbound: relative speed = $ c - v $, distance = D, so time $ t_1 = D / (c - v) $
- Return: light comes back at speed $ c $, but the distance is now $ D + v t_1 $, and during return time $ t_2 $, the Earth is not moving, so light just covers the distance $ D + v t_1 $ at speed $ c $, so $ t_2 = (D + v t_1)/c $

But this is inconsistent—better to say: on return, the light is emitted from a moving source, but once emitted, it travels at $ c $ toward Earth; the distance at reflection is $ D + v t_1 $, and during return, that distance doesn’t increase because Earth is fixed and light is in transit—actually, in this naive model, we assume no further expansion during return, which is inconsistent.

Better: assume mirror moves at constant speed $ v = H_0 D $, so its position is $ x_m(t) = D + v t $

Outbound: light position $ x_l(t) = c t $. They meet when:

$$
c t_1 = D + v t_1 \Rightarrow t_1 = \frac{D}{c - v}
$$

At that moment, mirror is at $ x_1 = c t_1 $

Return: light now travels back: its position is $ x_l(t) = x_1 - c (t - t_1) $

Earth is at 0, so arrival when $ x_l(T) = 0 $:

$$
0 = x_1 - c (T - t_1) \Rightarrow T = t_1 + \frac{x_1}{c} = t_1 + \frac{c t_1}{c} = 2 t_1
$$

So $ T = 2 t_1 = \frac{2D}{c - v} = \frac{2D}{c - H_0 D} $

Now solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
T (c - H_0 D) = 2D \\
T c - T H_0 D = 2D \\
T H_0 D = T c - 2D \\
H_0 = \frac{T c - 2D}{T D} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

Hmm, different from previous result.

Which is correct?

But note: this model assumes mirror moves at constant speed $ H_0 D $, but in reality, in exponential expansion, velocity increases with time. However, for small $ H_0 t $, $ v(t) = H_0 D e^{H_0 t} \approx H_0 D (1 + H_0 t) \approx H_0 D $, so constant velocity is okay to first order.

But in this model, we get:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

But if $ H_0 = 0 $, then $ T = 2D/c $, so RHS = $ c/D - 2c/(2D) = c/D - c/D = 0 $, good.

Now, use approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $. In this model, we didn’t use exponentials, but the problem gave $ S = s e^{H_0 t} $. So perhaps we should use that directly.

Let’s go back to the exact meeting condition:

Outbound: light leaves at t=0, reaches mirror at t=t1.

Light travel distance = c t1

Mirror position = D e^{H_0 t1}

So:

$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}
$$

Similarly, on return: light leaves mirror at t1, returns at T.

The light must travel a distance equal to the mirror’s position at t1, but during return, does the distance shrink? In this naive model, assume that return distance is just D e^{H_0 t1}, and light covers it at speed c, so:

$$
T - t_1 = \frac{D e^{H_0 t_1}}{c} = t_1
\Rightarrow T = 2 t_1
$$

So again, T = 2 t1, and

$$
c \frac{T}{2} = D e^{H_0 T/2}
\Rightarrow \frac{c T}{2 D} = e^{H_0 T / 2}
$$

Take natural log:

$$
\ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right) = \frac{H_0 T}{2}
\Rightarrow H_0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)
$$

This is an exact expression under the assumption that light travel distance equals proper distance at emission/reflection, and return time equals outbound time (which is only true if expansion is ignored during return, which is inconsistent).

But note: in reality, in expanding universe, return time ≠ outbound time.

However, the problem may be expecting this simple approach.

But then it says: “You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $”.

So assume $ H_0 T \ll 1 $, so expand the exponential in the equation:

From outbound: $ c t_1 = D (1 + H_0 t_1) $

As before: $ t_1 = D / (c - D H_0) \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + \frac{D H_0}{c}) $

Then return time: if we assume the light returns through static space (no expansion on return), then $ t_2 = D e^{H_0 t_1} / c \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + H_0 t_1) \approx \frac{D}{c} (1 + H_0 \frac{D}{c}) $

So total T ≈ 2D/c (1 + H_0 D / c )

Thus:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c} + \frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2}
$$

Solve for H_0:

$$
T - \frac{2D}{c} \approx \frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2} \\
\Rightarrow H_0 \approx \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right ) = \frac{c^2 T}{2 D^2} - \frac{c}{D}
$$

This is yet another expression.

But which one is consistent with the given law S = s e^{H0 t}?

Let’s use the following consistent first-order approach:

- At time t, mirror at S(t) = D (1 + H0 t)
- Light outbound: satisfies integral of motion: the light’s position x(t) = c t
- Mirror position = D (1 + H0 t)
- Meet when c t1 = D (1 + H0 t1) → t1 = D/(c - D H0) ≈ D/c + D^2 H0 / c^2

- At reflection, distance = c t1 ≈ D + D^2 H0 / c

- Return: now, light travels back. But during return, the universe still expands, so the proper distance between light and Earth increases? Actually, no: once light is returning, it is moving through space toward Earth; the expansion tries to stretch the space behind it, but to first order, the return travel time is just (distance at reflection)/c, because the expansion effect on return is second-order.

So t2 ≈ (D + D^2 H0 / c)/c = D/c + D^2 H0 / c^2

So total T = t1 + t2 ≈ 2D/c + 2 D^2 H0 / c^2

Thus:

$$
H_0 \approx \frac{c^2}{2 D^2} \left( T - \frac{2D}{c} \right )
$$

This seems reasonable.

Now, the problem says “Find an expression for H0 as a function of D, c, and T”. And allows use of e^x ≈ 1 + x.

So likely, they expect this first-order result.

We can write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c^2 T - 2 c D}{2 D^2}
$$

Or:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{2 D^2} (c T - 2 D)
$$

But let’s check dimensions: H0 has units of [1/time]. RHS: c [L/T], D [L], T [T]

c T → [L], so c T - 2D → [L], then c*(c T - 2D) → [L^2/T], divided by D^2 [L^2] → [1/T]. Good.

Alternatively, factor:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} \left( \frac{c T}{2 D} - 1 \right )
$$

Now, note that if T = 2D/c, then H0 = 0, as expected.

So this is plausible.

But wait—earlier, using the comoving coordinate method, we got:

H0 ≈ (2/T) - (4D)/(c T^2)

Are these equivalent to first order?

Let’s expand our new expression in terms of small H0.

From T ≈ 2D/c + 2 D^2 H0 / c^2, solve for H0:

H0 ≈ (c^2 / (2 D^2)) (T - 2D/c)

Now express this in terms of T:

Let’s write T = 2D/c (1 + ε), where ε = (H0 D)/c (from earlier)

Then H0 = (c^2 / (2 D^2)) (2D/c ε) = (c / D) ε = H0, consistent.

Now, the other expression: H0 = 2/T - 4D/(c T^2)

Plug T = 2D/c (1 + ε) ≈ 2D/c (1 - ε) for 1/T

1/T ≈ c/(2D) (1 - ε)

1/T^2 ≈ c^2/(4 D^2) (1 - 2ε)

Then:

2/T ≈ c/D (1 - ε)

4D/(c T^2) ≈ 4D/c * c^2/(4 D^2) (1 - 2ε) = c/D (1 - 2ε)

So H0 ≈ c/D (1 - ε) - c/D (1 - 2ε) = c/D (ε) = H0

So both expressions are equivalent to first order! They are just different algebraic rearrangements.

Indeed, let’s show algebraically:

Expression 1: H0 = (c^2 T - 2 c D) / (2 D^2)

Expression 2: H0 = 2/T - 4D/(c T^2)

Set them equal?

Compute RHS of expr2:

= (2 c T - 4D) / (c T^2)

Not obviously same.

But they are both first-order approximations, so they agree when expanded around H0=0, but differ at higher order.

Given that the problem gives S = s e^{H0 t}, and suggests using e^x ≈ 1 + x, the simplest consistent approach is:

- Outbound: c t1 = D (1 + H0 t1)
- Return: c (T - t1) = D (1 + H0 t1)  [assuming distance at reflection is what matters, and return is at speed c]
- So T - t1 = t1 ⇒ T = 2 t1
- Then c T/2 = D (1 + H0 T/2)
- Solve: c T/2 = D + D H0 T/2
- Rearranged: c T/2 - D = D H0 T/2
- Multiply both sides by 2: c T - 2D = D H0 T
- So: H0 = (c T - 2D) / (D T)

This is yet another expression!

Check: H0 = (c T - 2D)/(D T) = c/D - 2/T

This matches the Newtonian constant-velocity model earlier.

And dimensions: c/D [1/T], 2/T [1/T], good.

Now, which assumption is most aligned with the problem?

The problem says: “the separation S between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe from the law S = s e^{H0 t}”

So at any time t, the proper distance is S(t) = D e^{H0 t}

When light is sent at t=0, mirror at D.

Light takes time t1 to reach mirror, so must satisfy that the **path length equals the integral of c dt**, but the mirror’s position is D e^{H0 t1}

If we assume that light travels through static space (not correct, but maybe intended), then distance traveled by light is c t1 = D e^{H0 t1}

Similarly, on return, light travels distance D e^{H0 t1} at speed c, taking time t2 = D e^{H0 t1}/c = t1, so T = 2 t1

Thus: c T/2 = D e^{H0 T/2}

Now use e^x ≈ 1 + x:

c T/2 ≈ D (1 + H0 T/2)

Then:

c T/2 - D ≈ D H0 T/2

=> H0 ≈ (c T - 2D) / (D T)

This uses the given exponential law and the approximation, and is simple.

Therefore, the expected answer is:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c T - 2D}{D T}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

This is clean, uses the given law with first-order approximation, and matches dimensional analysis.

Thus, final answer:

**$ H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T} $**","A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. Consider that the separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, the radiation would return and be detected, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences.

$$
S(t) = s e^{H_0 t}
$$

Here:
- $ s $ is the initial separation at $ t = 0 $,
- $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant (to be determined),
- The mirror is placed at an initial distance $ D $, so likely $ s = D $,
- A laser is sent from Earth toward the mirror, and after some time $ T $, the reflected light returns to Earth,
- The mirror is perfectly reflecting and maintains orientation (so reflection works as expected),
- We're told to find an expression for $ H_0 $ in terms of $ D $, $ T $, and possibly $ c $, using the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

In an expanding universe, the distance to the mirror increases with time. The laser is emitted at time $ t = 0 $ from Earth, travels toward the mirror, which is receding due to expansion. The light reaches the mirror at some time $ t = t_1 $, then reflects and returns to Earth, arriving at time $ t = T $. So total round-trip time is $ T $.

However, note that **in this model**, the separation between Earth and mirror evolves as:

$$
S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}
$$

assuming the mirror is placed at initial distance $ D $ at $ t = 0 $. (So $ s = D $.)

But here's a subtlety: In standard cosmology, light propagation in an expanding universe is governed by integrating over the scale factor. However, this problem gives us an explicit law for the separation: $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $. This suggests a **non-standard** treatment—perhaps assuming that the proper distance grows exponentially, and light moves through this changing distance at speed $ c $ relative to local comoving coordinates? But the problem seems to treat it more simply: perhaps assuming that light always travels at speed $ c $ relative to the instantaneous separation.

But that’s ambiguous. However, since this is a **thought experiment** in a **Steady-State Universe**, and they give us $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and ask us to use the approximation $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, implying $ H_0 t \ll 1 $, we can assume the expansion is **slow** over the light travel time, so we can treat the problem in a quasi-static way.

Let’s proceed with a **first-order approximation** in $ H_0 $.

---

### Step 2: Model the light travel

Assume the laser is emitted at $ t = 0 $. Let the light reach the mirror at time $ t = t_1 $. During this time, the mirror has moved from $ D $ to $ S(t_1) = D e^{H_0 t_1} $.

But the light is chasing a receding mirror. In an expanding universe, the proper distance the light must cover isn't just $ D $, because the mirror moves while light is in transit.

However, if expansion is slow ($ H_0 t \ll 1 $), we can approximate the motion of the mirror as having constant velocity:

From $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \approx D(1 + H_0 t) $, so the mirror's **recession velocity** is approximately:

$$
v(t) = \frac{dS}{dt} = D H_0 e^{H_0 t} \approx D H_0 (1 + H_0 t) \approx D H_0 \quad (\text{to first order})
$$

So during the light’s travel, the mirror is moving away at roughly constant speed $ v \approx D H_0 $.

Now, in classical terms (Doppler-like), if a light signal is sent toward a receding mirror moving at speed $ v \ll c $, the time to reach the mirror is longer than $ D/c $, and the return trip is also affected because the Earth is “chasing” the returning light? Wait — but in this model, is the Earth also comoving? Yes, both Earth and mirror are comoving with the expansion, so their separation increases as $ D e^{H_0 t} $. So on the return trip, the light is approaching Earth, which is receding from the mirror—but actually, from the light’s perspective, Earth is moving away from the point of reflection.

But again, in the small-$H_0$ limit, we can model this as a mirror moving away at speed $ v = H_0 D $, and use classical kinematics for light (since relativistic corrections would be second order).

But caution: in relativity, light always moves at $ c $ in local inertial frames, but over large distances in expanding space, you need to integrate null geodesics. However, given the instruction to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, we are clearly to do a **first-order approximation** in $ H_0 $, treating the expansion as a small perturbation.

So let's consider the following approach:

### Step 3: Use proper distance and light travel in expanding space (simplified)

In an exponentially expanding universe (de Sitter space), the scale factor is $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, and the proper distance between comoving objects is $ S(t) = a(t) \chi $, where $ \chi $ is the comoving distance.

For light, the comoving distance traveled is:

$$
\chi = \int_{t_{\text{emit}}}^{t_{\text{obs}}} \frac{c\, dt}{a(t)}
$$

But in this problem, they **define** the proper distance as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, which implies that the comoving distance is $ \chi = D $, since $ S(t) = a(t) \chi = e^{H_0 t} \chi $, so $ \chi = D $.

Wait—that would mean that at $ t = 0 $, $ S(0) = D $, yes.

Now, light emitted from Earth at $ t = 0 $ travels to the mirror. The comoving distance to the mirror is $ D $. The light must cover this comoving distance:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} \frac{c\, dt}{a(t)} = D
$$

Since $ a(t) = e^{H_0 t} $, we have:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = D
\Rightarrow \frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) = D
$$

Similarly, after reflection at $ t = t_1 $, the light returns to Earth. The comoving distance is again $ D $, so:

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} \frac{c\, dt}{a(t)} = D
\Rightarrow \frac{c}{H_0} (e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T}) = D
$$

Add both equations:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

This is an exact relation in this exponential expansion model.

Now, solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

This is a transcendental equation. But we are told to use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for small $ x $, i.e., $ H_0 T \ll 1 $. Then:

$$
e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T
\Rightarrow 1 - (1 - H_0 T) = H_0 T
$$

So left-hand side becomes $ H_0 T $, and right-hand side is $ \frac{2 D H_0}{c} $

Thus:

$$
H_0 T \approx \frac{2 D H_0}{c}
$$

Assuming $ H_0 \ne 0 $, divide both sides by $ H_0 $:

$$
T \approx \frac{2D}{c}
$$

Wait—that’s just the flat spacetime result! So to **first order**, the expansion doesn’t affect the round-trip time? That can’t help us measure $ H_0 $.

Ah! So we need to go to **second order**? But the problem says we may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $, suggesting that maybe the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a **naive model**: that light travels at speed $ c $ relative to the instantaneous proper distance, so the time to reach the mirror is the integral of $ dS / (c - v) $ or something.

Let’s try a simpler, Newtonian-like model:

Assume that at time $ t $, the mirror is at distance $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $. Light is emitted at $ t = 0 $. It reaches the mirror when the distance traveled by light equals the distance to the mirror **at that time**. But that’s not correct, because the mirror is moving while light is in transit.

But in a naive model, one might say: light going out covers distance $ c t_1 $, and this must equal the distance to the mirror at time $ t_1 $, i.e.:

$$
c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1}
$$

Similarly, on the return trip, light travels for time $ T - t_1 $, covering distance $ c (T - t_1) $, which must equal the distance from mirror to Earth at time $ t_1 $? No—that doesn’t make sense, because during return, the Earth is not moving away; the distance is decreasing.

Actually, in this naive model, perhaps they assume that the light returns from the **location** where the mirror was at time $ t_1 $, and that location is now further away, but the light just travels back through static space? That contradicts expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the **total path length** is just twice the distance at emission, but adjusted for expansion during travel.

But given the problem statement: *""the separation S between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe from the law S = s e^{H0 t}""*, and that the laser is sent for a long time, and after time T the radiation returns.

Perhaps the key is this: the light is **continuously** emitted (for a long time), and the reflection is detected at time T **after emission starts**. So the first photons emitted at t=0 return at t=T.

So we need to compute T as a function of D and H0, then invert to get H0(D,T).

Given the earlier exact result from integrating null geodesics:

$$
\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T}) = 2D
$$

Now, use the approximation $ e^{-H_0 T} \approx 1 - H_0 T + \frac{(H_0 T)^2}{2} $, but the problem only allows $ e^x \approx 1 + x $. However, if we use only first-order, we get no dependence on H0, as seen.

But maybe the problem assumes a **different model**: that the distance increases as $ S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} $, and the light **always** travels at speed c relative to the local proper distance, so the time to go out is:

$$
\int_0^{t_1} c dt = \int_D^{S(t_1)} dS = S(t_1) - D = D(e^{H_0 t_1} - 1)
\Rightarrow c t_1 = D(e^{H_0 t_1} - 1)
$$

Similarly, on return, the light must cover the distance $ S(t_1) $ back to Earth, but during return time $ T - t_1 $, the Earth is not moving? Or is the distance fixed after reflection?

This is inconsistent.

Wait—maybe the mirror is **fixed in proper distance**? No, the problem says the separation increases due to expansion.

Another interpretation: The mirror is placed at a fixed **comoving** coordinate, so its proper distance grows as $ D e^{H_0 t} $, with $ D = S(0) $. Light is sent at t=0, and we want the round-trip **proper time** T as measured by Earth clocks.

In de Sitter space, the round-trip time for a comoving mirror is indeed given by the integral we wrote.

But again, to first order in H0, T = 2D/c, so no info about H0.

Unless... the problem assumes that the **laser is sent continuously**, and due to expansion, the light is **redshifted**, but that doesn’t give T.

Wait, re-read the question:

> ""From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time T, [the radiation would return and be detected]""

So T is the round-trip light travel time.

They want an expression for H0 as a function of D, T, and c, using the approximation e^x ≈ 1 + x.

But as shown, to first order, T = 2D/c, independent of H0. So you cannot determine H0 to first order.

Unless the model is **not** using comoving coordinates, but rather assumes that the distance at time t is S(t) = D e^{H0 t}, and that light speed relative to Earth is c, but the mirror is moving away, so the **outbound** travel time t1 satisfies:

The light closes the distance at rate c - v(t), but v(t) = dS/dt = H0 S(t) = H0 D e^{H0 t}

This is a differential equation:

Let x(t) be the position of the light pulse (proper distance from Earth). Then:

dx/dt = c

Mirror position: S(t) = D e^{H0 t}

Light reaches mirror when x(t1) = S(t1)

But x(t) = c t (since light leaves Earth at t=0)

So:

c t1 = D e^{H0 t1}

Similarly, on return, light leaves mirror at t1 from position S(t1), and travels back at speed c (toward Earth), so its position is:

x(t) = S(t1) - c (t - t1)

It reaches Earth when x(t) = 0:

0 = D e^{H0 t1} - c (T - t1)

=> c (T - t1) = D e^{H0 t1}

So both legs give the same equation:

c t1 = D e^{H0 t1}

c (T - t1) = D e^{H0 t1}

Therefore:

t1 = T - t1 => T = 2 t1

So t1 = T/2

Then:

c (T/2) = D e^{H0 T/2}

=> e^{H0 T/2} = \frac{c T}{2 D}

Take natural log:

H0 T/2 = \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)

=> H0 = \frac{2}{T} \ln\left( \frac{c T}{2 D} \right)

Now, if H0 is small, then H0 T/2 is small, so the argument of ln is close to 1.

Let’s define ε = H0 T/2 ≪ 1

Then e^ε = c T / (2 D) ≈ 1 + ε

So:

c T / (2 D) ≈ 1 + H0 T / 2

Multiply both sides by 2D:

c T ≈ 2 D + D H0 T

Bring terms together:

c T - 2 D ≈ D H0 T

=> H0 ≈ \frac{c T - 2 D}{D T} = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}

But wait, in flat space, T = 2D/c, so c T = 2D, so numerator is zero. So this measures the deviation from flat space.

Now, using the approximation e^x ≈ 1 + x, let's apply it to the equation:

c T/2 = D e^{H0 T/2} ≈ D (1 + H0 T/2)

Then:

c T/2 ≈ D + D H0 T/2

Subtract D:

c T/2 - D ≈ D H0 T/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

c T - 2 D ≈ D H0 T

Thus:

H0 ≈ \frac{c T - 2 D}{D T}

This expresses H0 in terms of D, T, and c.

We can write it as:

$$
H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

But is this consistent with the problem statement?

The problem says: ""Find an expression for $ H_0 $ as a function of $ D $, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $ H_0 $. You may use $ e^x \approx 1 + x $ for $ x \ll 1 $, where $ s $ is the initial separation.""

It also mentions $ s $, and we assumed $ s = D $.

Also, they say ""a large, ... mirror"" — probably a typo.

So, under the **naive model** where light travels at speed c through proper distance, and the mirror's proper distance grows as $ D e^{H_0 t} $, and light's position is $ x = ct $, then the derivation above holds.

Even though this model is not strictly correct in general relativity, it may be what the problem intends, especially since it gives a solvable expression.

Thus, final answer:

From $ c \frac{T}{2} = D e^{H_0 T/2} $, using $ e^{H_0 T/2} \approx 1 + \frac{H_0 T}{2} $, we get:

$$
\frac{c T}{2} \approx D \left(1 + \frac{H_0 T}{2} \right)
$$

Solve for $ H_0 $:

$$
\frac{c T}{2 D} - 1 \approx \frac{H_0 T}{2}
\Rightarrow H_0 \approx \frac{2}{T} \left( \frac{c T}{2 D} - 1 \right) = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}
$$

So,

$$
\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c}{D} - \frac{2}{T}}
$$

From the first equation, using the approximation $ e^{H_0 t_1} \\approx 1 + H_0 t_1 $ (since $ H_0 t_1 \\ll 1 $), we get:\n\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{D(1 + e^{H_0 t_1})}{2} \\approx \\frac{D(2 + H_0 t_1)}{2} = D\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1\\right) = c t_1\n$$\n\nSolving for $ t_1 $:\n\n$$\nc t_1 = D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 t_1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t_1 \\left(c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0\\right) = D \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the return trip, the mirror is now at distance $ S_1 $, and during time $ t_2 $ the distance grows to $ S_1 e^{H_0 t_2} $. Using the same average-distance approximation and linearizing:\n\n$$\nS_2 = \\frac{S_1(1 + e^{H_0 t_2})}{2} \\approx S_1\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2\\right) = c t_2\n$$\n\nSubstituting $ S_1 = c t_1 $:\n\n$$\nc t_2 = c t_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t_2 = t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} t_1 H_0 t_2\n$$\n\nTo first order in $ H_0 $, we can approximate $ t_2 \\approx t_1 $ on the right-hand side of the correction term, so:\n\n$$\nt_2 \\approx t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} t_1^2 H_0\n$$\n\nThus, the total time is:\n\n$$\nT = t_1 + t_2 \\approx 2 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} t_1^2 H_0\n$$\n\nBut from earlier, $ t_1 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} \\left(1 + \\frac{D H_0}{2c}\\right) $ (expanding $ 1/(c - D H_0/2) $), so to first order:\n\n$$\nt_1 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nT \\approx 2\\left(\\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{D}{c}\\right)^2 H_0 = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{c^2} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{3 D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}\n$$\n\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent approach—used in the given solution—is to note that the total path length for the return trip is approximately $ S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T) $, as derived from averaging over the full interval. This implies that the effective average distance during the entire round trip is increased by cosmic expansion.\n\nAlternatively, from the expression for $ S_1 = c t_1 \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) $, solving for $ t_1 $ gives $ t_1 \\approx \\frac{D}{c}(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) $, which to first order yields $ t_1 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} $. Similarly, the return leg starts at $ S_1 \\approx D + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c} $, and ends at $ S_1 e^{H_0 t_2} \\approx S_1 (1 + H_0 t_2) $, so the average distance is $ \\approx S_1 (1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) $, and setting equal to $ c t_2 $ leads to $ t_2 \\approx \\frac{S_1}{c}(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) \\approx \\frac{D}{c}(1 + \\frac{D H_0}{2 c})(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) $. To first order, $ t_2 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} + \\frac{D H_0}{2 c} t_2 $, so $ t_2 (1 - \\frac{D H_0}{2 c}) \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} $, giving $ t_2 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{c^2} $. Then $ T = t_1 + t_2 \\approx \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{3 D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} $, but this contradicts the simpler linear result used in the solution.\n\nGiven the solution’s final result is linear in $ H_0 $ and matches standard derivations for small $ H_0 $, the correct intermediate step is to recognize that the total round-trip distance is effectively $ cT = 2D + D H_0 T $, because during time $ T $, the mirror recedes at speed $ v = H_0 D $, so the extra path length is approximately $ v T = H_0 D T $, split equally between outbound and return.

However, a simpler and more consistent approach is to use the total round-trip time directly.\n\nThe light travels outward while the mirror recedes. The distance at time $t$ is $D e^{H_0 t}$. For small $H_0 t$, $e^{H_0 t} \\approx 1 + H_0 t$. The photon's position satisfies $dx/dt = c$, but the mirror's position is $x_m(t) = D e^{H_0 t}$.

At time $t_1$, the separation is $D e^{H_0 t_1} \\approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)$. The photon moves toward Earth at speed $c$, but the Earth moves away due to expansion. The relative closing speed is reduced. Alternatively, in comoving coordinates, the return path is symmetric in this approximation.\n\nHowever, using the average-distance method as in the given solution, and noting that $T = t_1 + t_2$, and from the earlier result:\n\n$$\nS_2 = D\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T\\right) = c t_2\n$$\n\nBut also, from the first leg: $c t_1 = D\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1\\right) \\Rightarrow t_1 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}$\n\nSimilarly, $t_2 \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2 c^2} + \\frac{D H_0 t_1}{c} \\approx \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{3 D^2 H_0}{2 c^2}$ (but this overcomplicates).\n\nInstead, add the two legs using the linearized law. The total time is approximately:\n\n$$\nT = t_1 + t_2 \\approx \\frac{D}{c}(1 + H_0 t_1/2) + \\frac{D(1 + H_0 t_1)}{c}(1 + H_0 t_2/2) \\quad \\text{(messy)}\n$$\n\nA better way: since $S(t) = D e^{H_0 t} \\approx D(1 + H_0 t)$, the photon going out satisfies:\n\nOutward: $c t_1 = D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 t_1$ (from average distance), so $t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - D H_0 / 2}$\n\nReturn: initial distance is $D(1 + H_0 t_1)$, so average distance is $\\frac{D(1 + H_0 t_1) + D(1 + H_0 T)}{2} = D\\left(1 + \\frac{H_0}{2}(t_1 + T)\\right)$, but $T = t_1 + t_2$, so this becomes $D(1 + \\frac{H_0}{2}(2 t_1 + t_2))$, which is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the provided approximations in the solution, and the final goal, we use the total round-trip distance traveled by light: $c T = S_1 + S_2$.\n\nFrom above:\n$S_1 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)$\n$S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nBut also, $S_2 = D(1 + H_0 t_1)(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) \\approx D(1 + H_0 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2)$\n\nEquating to $D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 (t_1 + t_2))$ implies $H_0 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2 = \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2 \\Rightarrow H_0 t_1 = \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1$, which is only true if $H_0=0$. So the average-distance assumption must be applied consistently.\n\nActually, the simplest consistent first-order calculation is:\n\n- Outward journey: mirror starts at $D$, ends at $D(1 + H_0 t_1)$. Average distance = $D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) = c t_1$\n- Return journey: Earth starts at distance $D(1 + H_0 t_1)$, ends at $D(1 + H_0 T)$. But the photon is returning, so the relevant distance is decreasing? No—in an expanding universe, even on return, the proper distance continues to increase, but the photon is moving toward us.\n\nHowever, in the steady-state model with exponential expansion, the return path can be treated by time-reversal symmetry only if expansion is negligible. Instead, note that the total time $T$ satisfies, to first order in $H_0$:\n\n$$\nc T = 2D + D H_0 T\n$$\n\nWhy? Because during the total time $T$, the distance has increased by $D H_0 T$ (since $\\Delta S \\approx D H_0 T$), and the light has to cover not just $2D$ but extra due to expansion. A standard result in cosmology for small $H_0 D/c$ is:\n\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{c^2}\n$$\n\nBut let’s derive it properly from the given framework.\n\nFrom the solution’s own steps:\n\nWe have $S_1 = c t_1 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)$ → $t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0} \\approx \\frac{D}{c}(1 + \\frac{D H_0}{2c})$\n\nSimilarly, $S_2 = c t_2 = S_1 (1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 (t_1 + t_2)) = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nSo $c t_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nNow add $c t_1 + c t_2 = c T = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) + D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T) = 2D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T$\n\nBut $t_1 \\approx D/c$, so to first order in $H_0$, replace $t_1$ with $D/c$:\n\n$c T \\approx 2D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T$\n\nBring terms with $T$ to left:\n\n$c T - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T \\approx 2D + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2c}$\n\n$T (c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0) \\approx 2D + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2c}$\n\nNow solve for $H_0$. But the problem asks for $H_0$ in terms of $D, c, T$. Assume $H_0$ is small, so keep only first-order terms. Then approximate $T \\approx 2D/c$ on the right-hand side where multiplied by $H_0$.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n$c T \\ 2D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 \\cdot \\frac{D}{c}$\n\nBut actually, a cleaner derivation from the exponential law:\n\nThe photon leaves at $t=0$, arrives at mirror at $t_1$: \n\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_1} c \\, dt = \\int_0^{t_1} \\frac{d}{dt}(D e^{H_0 t}) dt \\quad \\text{No—this is wrong.}\n$$\n\nCorrect: the proper distance at time $t$ is $a(t) \\chi$, but in steady-state, $a(t) = e^{H_0 t}$, so comoving distance to mirror is fixed: $\\chi = D$ (since at $t=0$, $a=1$, distance = $D$). Then proper distance at time $t$ is $D e^{H_0 t}$.\n\nPhoton moving outward: $d(a \\chi)/dt = c$ → but for radial null geodesic: $c dt = a(t) d\\chi$, so $\\Delta \\chi = \\int_0^{t_1} \\frac{c dt}{a(t)} = \\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})$\n\nBut $\\Delta \\chi = D$ (comoving distance), so:\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})\n$$\n\nSimilarly, on return, same comoving distance, so total comoving distance traversed is $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1}) + \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_2})$? No—return trip: photon goes from mirror to Earth, so $\\Delta \\chi = D = \\int_{t_1}^{T} \\frac{c dt}{a(t)} = \\frac{c}{H_0}(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})$\n\nThus:\n\nOutward: $D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})$\n\nReturn: $D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})$\n\nAdd them: $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T})$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\ne^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}\n$$\n\nFor small $H_0 T$, $e^{-H_0 T} \\approx 1 - H_0 T + \\frac{1}{2} H_0^2 T^2 \\approx 1 - H_0 T$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\n1 - H_0 T \\approx 1 - \\frac{2 D H_0}{c} \\Rightarrow H_0 T \\approx \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}\n$$\n\nCancel $H_0$ (assuming $H_0 \\ne 0$):\n\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{2D}{c}\n$$\n\nThis gives no information!

In classical terms with recession velocity $v = H_0 D(t)$, the time to reach mirror satisfies:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_1} (c - H_0 D(t)) dt = D\n$$\n\nBut $D(t) \\approx D(1 + H_0 t)$, so:\n\n$\\int_0^{t_1} [c - H_0 D (1 + H_0 t)] dt = D$\n\nTo first order in $H_0$, ignore $H_0^2$:\n\n$\\int_0^{t_1} (c - H_0 D) dt = D \\Rightarrow (c - H_0 D) t_1 = D \\Rightarrow t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - H_0 D} \\approx \\frac{D}{c}(1 + \\frac{H_0 D}{c})$\n\nOn return, the Earth is receding at velocity $H_0 D(T')$ at time $T'$, so the closing speed is $c + H_0 D(T')$? No—if the photon is coming toward us and we are moving away, the relative speed is $c - v$, but in proper distance, it's tricky.\n\nHowever, the problem's own method uses average distance.

Which one is correct?\n\nLet’s test with numbers. Suppose $D = 1$ light-year, $H_0 = 70$ km/s/Mpc ≈ $2.27 \\times 10^{-18}$ s⁻¹. Then $H_0 D/c ≈ 2.27e-18 * 3.16e7 ≈ 7e-11$, very small.\n\nExact: $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) \\Rightarrow e^{-H_0 T} = 1 - \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}$\n\nTake log: $-H_0 T = \\ln(1 - \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}) \\approx -\\frac{2 D H_0}{c} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{2 D H_0}{c})^2$\n\nSo $H_0 T = \\frac{2 D H_0}{c} + \\frac{2 D^2 H_0^2}{c^2} \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2}$\n\nThus: $c T = 2D + \\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c} \\Rightarrow H_0 = \\frac{c(c T - 2D)}{2 D^2}$\n\nAh!

Let's verify:\n\nOutward: $D = \\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 t_1})$\n\nReturn: the comoving distance is the same, so $D = \\int_{t_1}^T c e^{-H_0 t} dt = \\frac{c}{H_0}(e^{-H_0 t_1} - e^{-H_0 T})$\n\nAdd: $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T})$ ✓\n\nThen $1 - e^{-H_0 T} = \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}$\n\nExpand: $H_0 T - \\frac{1}{2} H_0^2 T^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{2 D H_0}{c}$\n\nDivide by $H_0$: $T - \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T^2 = \\frac{2D}{c}$\n\nSo $T - \\frac{2D}{c} = \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T^2$\n\nThus $H_0 = \\frac{2(T - 2D/c)}{T^2} = \\frac{2(c T - 2D)}{c T^2}$\n\nBut from the series expansion of $T$, we had $T = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c^2}$, so $c T - 2D = \\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c} \\Rightarrow H_0 = \\frac{c(c T - 2D)}{2 D^2}$\n\nThese two expressions for $H_0$ must be consistent to first order. Since $T \\approx 2D/c$, then $T^2 \\approx 4D^2/c^2$, so:\n\n$\\frac{2(c T - 2D)}{c T^2} \\approx \\frac{2(c T - 2D)}{c \\cdot 4D^2/c^2} = \\frac{2(c T - 2D) c}{4 D^2} = \\frac{c(c T - 2D)}{2 D^2}$\n\nYes! They agree to first order. So both are valid, but the problem likely expects the form in terms of $D, c, T$ without $T^2$ in denominator if possible, but actually the cleanest is from the expansion:\n\nFrom $c T = 2D + \\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c}$, so:\n\n$$\nH_0 = \\frac{c(c T - 2D)}{2 D^2}\n$$\n\nNow, how to get this from the given solution's framework?\n\nThe given solution has:\n\n$S_1 = c t_1 = \\frac{D(1 + e^{H_0 t_1})}{2} \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)$\n\n$S_2 = c t_2 = \\frac{S_1(1 + e^{H_0 t_2})}{2} \\approx S_1(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_2) \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 (t_1 + t_2)) = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nThen total distance traveled by light: $c T = S_1 + S_2 \\approx D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) + D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T) = 2D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 t_1 + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T$\n\nNow, to first order, $t_1 \\approx D/c$, and $T \\approx 2D/c$, but instead, notice that in the exact treatment, the dominant correction is $\\frac{2 D^2 H_0}{c}$, which suggests that the average of $t_1$ and $t_2$ is $D/c$, so perhaps the correct average is to set $t_1 = t_2 = T/2$ to first order.\n\nAssume $t_1 = t_2 = T/2$ in the correction terms. Then:\n\n$c T = 2D + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 (T/2) + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T = 2D + \\frac{1}{4} D H_0 T + \\frac{1}{2} D H_0 T = 2D + \\frac{3}{4} D H_0 T$\n\nThen $c T - 2D = \\frac{3}{4} D H_0 T \\Rightarrow H_0 = \\frac{4(c T - 2D)}{3 D T}$, which is different.\n\nGiven the exact result, the average-distance method as applied in the solution is flawed. However, the problem says ""as a first order approximation, we will take distance travelled by the photon in each part as an average of the initial and final distance"", and they have already derived $S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$.\n\nAlso, from the first equation, they have $c t_1 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)$.\n\nNow, the total time $T = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{S_1}{c} + \\frac{S_2}{c} = \\frac{1}{c} [D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) + D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)] = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{D H_0}{2c} t_1 + \\frac{D H_0}{2c} T$\n\nMultiply both sides by $c$:\n\n$c T = 2D + \\frac{D H_0}{2} t_1 + \\frac{D H_0}{2} T$\n\nNow, solve for $H_0$:\n\n$c T - 2D = \\frac{D H_0}{2} (t_1 + T)$\n\nBut $t_1 = T - t_2 \\approx T - D/c$, and $D/c \\approx T/2$, so $t_1 + T \\approx T/2 + T = 3T/2$, leading to the earlier result.\n\nHowever, the problem likely expects us to use the fact that for small $H_0$, $t_1 \\approx t_2 \\approx D/c$, so $t_1 + T \\approx D/c + 2D/c = 3D/c$, then:\n\n$c T - 2D = \\frac{D H_0}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3D}{c} = \\frac{3 D^2 H_0}{2c}$\n\nSo $H_0 = \\frac{2c(c T - 2D)}{3 D^2}$\n\nBut this conflicts with the exact result.\n\nGiven the instructions, and that the solution has already computed $S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$, and we know that the total path length is $cT = S_1 + S_2$, and from the first leg $S_1 = c t_1 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1)$, but perhaps the intended next step is to realize that in the return trip, the initial distance is $S_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \\approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)$, and the final distance when the light returns is $D e^{H_0 T} \\approx D(1 + H_0 T)$, so the average distance for the return trip is $\\frac{D(1 + H_0 t_1) + D(1 + H_0 T)}{2} = D(1 + \\frac{H_0}{2}(t_1 + T)) = D(1 + \\frac{H_0}{2}(2t_1 + t_2))$, which is not what they have.\n\nBut in the solution, they have already approximated $S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$, and also have $S_2 = c t_2$, and $T = t_1 + t_2$.\n\nFrom the first equation: $c t_1 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 t_1) \\Rightarrow t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0}$\n\nFrom the second: $c t_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T) \\Rightarrow t_2 = \\frac{D}{c}(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nSo $T = \\frac{D}{c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0} + \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D H_0 T}{2c}$\n\nNow, neglecting higher-order terms, approximate $\\frac{1}{c - \\frac{1}{2} D H_0} \\approx \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{D H_0}{2c^2}$, so:\n\n$T \\approx D(\\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{D H_0}{2c^2}) + \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{D H_0 T}{2c} = \\frac{2D}{c} + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2c^2} + \\frac{D H_0 T}{2c}$\n\nMultiply by $c$:\n\n$c T = 2D + \\frac{D^2 H_0}{2c} + \\frac{D H_0 T}{2}$\n\nThen:\n\n$c T - 2D = \\frac{D H_0}{2} ( \\frac{D}{c} + T )$\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, to first order, $T \\approx 2D/c$, so substitute on the right:\n\n$c T - 2D = \\frac{D H_0}{2} ( \\frac{D}{c} + \\frac{2D}{c} ) = \\frac{D H_0}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3D}{c} = \\frac{3 D^2 H_0}{2c}$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nH_0 = \\frac{2c (c T - 2D)}{3 D^2}\n$$\n\nGiven that the problem uses the average-distance method, and this is what follows from their own equations, this is likely the expected answer.\n\nTherefore, continuing from their last line:\n\nsimilarly, ${S}_{2} = \\frac{2{S}_{1}c}{{2c} - {S}_{1}{H}_{0}}$\n\nSubstitute $S_1 = \\frac{2Dc}{2c - D H_0}$ into this:\n\n$S_2 = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{2Dc}{2c - D H_0} \\cdot c}{2c - \\frac{2Dc}{2c - D H_0} \\cdot H_0} = \\frac{\\frac{4D c^2}{2c - D H_0}}{\\frac{2c(2c - D H_0) - 2D c H_0}{2c - D H_0}} = \\frac{4D c^2}{4c^2 - 2c D H_0 - 2D c H_0} = \\frac{4D c^2}{4c^2 - 4D c H_0} = \\frac{D c}{c - D H_0}$\n\nBut from earlier, $S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$\n\nAlso, $S_2 = c t_2$, and $T = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{S_1}{c} + \\frac{S_2}{c} = \\frac{2D}{2c - D H_0} + \\frac{D}{c - D H_0}$\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the context, the <Replace> should be the final expression for $H_0$.\n\nSince the solution has $S_2 = D(1 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 T)$ and also from the return trip kinematics, but the simplest way is to use the total time.\n\nFrom the exact null geodesic, we have $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0}(1 - e^{-H_0 T}) \\approx \\frac{c}{H_0}(H_0 T - \\frac{1}{2} H_0^2 T^2) = c T - \\frac{1}{2} c H_0 T^2$\n\nSo $2D = c T - \\frac{1}{2} c H_0 T^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} c H_0 T^2 = c T - 2D \\Rightarrow H_0 = \\frac{2(c T - 2D)}{c T^2}$\n\nThis is clean and comes from the given law $S = s e^{H_0 t}$ via the null geodesic, which is the correct physics.\n\nAnd the problem says ""from the law $S = s e^{H_0 t}$"", so this should be used.\n\nIn the thought experiment, the proper distance at time t is $S(t) = D e^{H_0 t}$.\n\nThe condition for the photon to reach the mirror at $t_1$ is that the integral of $c dt$ equals the integral of the changing distance, but in FRW metric, it's the comoving distance that is constant, leading to $D = \\int_0^{t_1} c e^{-H_0 t} dt$.\n\nSo the correct expression is $H_0 = \\frac{2}{T^2} \\left( T - \\frac{2D}{c} \\right)$.\n\nGiven that the problem allows $e^x \\approx 1+x$, but for the integral, we need to integrate $e^{-H_0 t}$.\n\nPerhaps the intended solution is:\n\nOutward journey: the mirror is at distance $D e^{H_0 t}$ at time t. The photon's position is $c t$. They meet when $c t_1 = D e^{H_0 t_1} \\approx D(1 + H_0 t_1)$\n\nSo $c t_1 = D + D H_0 t_1 \\Rightarrow t_1 = \\frac{D}{c - D H_0}$\n\nReturn journey: at time $t_1$, distance is $D e^{H_0 t_1}$. The photon returns, and at time T, the distance is $D e^{H_0 T}$. The photon's travel back: the distance it covers is $D e^{H_0 t_1} = c (T - t_1) + \\text{expansion effect}$? This is ambiguous.\n\nIf we assume that on the return, the distance at time t is $D e^{H_0 t}$, and the photon is moving toward us, then the meeting condition is that the integral of c dt from t_1 to T equals the distance at t_1 minus the change, but it's not straightforward.\n\nGiven the time, and that the exact method gives $H_0 = \\frac{2(cT - 2D)}{c T^2}$, and this is standard, I think this is the answer.\n\nSo in the <Replace>, we should have the final steps leading to this.\n\nFrom the law $S = s e^{H_0 t}$, the comoving distance is constant, so the lookback time for a round trip is given by $2D = \\frac{c}{H_0} (1 - e^{-H_0 T})$.

- The powers of $ c $ and $ R $ in the expression are the same.
- We can use dimensional analysis combined with the given information to construct the formula.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In a binary system with two equal masses $ M $, separated by a distance $ 2R $ (since each orbits at radius $ R $ from the center of mass), the orbital separation is $ a = 2R $. However, note that sometimes in gravitational wave literature, $ R $ may refer to the **separation** between the two bodies. But here the problem explicitly says: ""two identical neutron stars of mass $ M $ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass"", so the **orbital radius** of each star is $ R $, and hence the **separation** between them is $ 2R $.

But we must be careful: in standard gravitational wave formulas, the luminosity depends on the **separation** between the two bodies, usually denoted $ a $. So we will keep this in mind, but proceed via dimensional analysis as instructed, using the given variables $ M $ and $ R $, where $ R $ is the orbital radius about the center of mass.

---

### Step 2: Use dimensional analysis

We are told that:
$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot G^a c^b M^c R^d
$$
and that **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**, i.e., $ b = d $.

Also, luminosity $ L_{GW} $ has dimensions of **energy per time**, i.e.,
$$
[L_{GW}] = [M][L]^2[T]^{-3}
$$

Now write dimensions of each constant:

- $ [G] = [M]^{-1}[L]^3[T]^{-2} $
- $ [c] = [L][T]^{-1} $
- $ [M] = [M] $
- $ [R] = [L] $

So the RHS has dimensions:

$$
[G]^a [c]^b [M]^c [R]^d = 
([M]^{-1}[L]^3[T]^{-2})^a \cdot ([L][T]^{-1})^b \cdot [M]^c \cdot [L]^d
$$

Combine exponents:

- Mass: $ -a + c $
- Length: $ 3a + b + d $
- Time: $ -2a - b $

Set equal to dimensions of luminosity: $ [M]^1 [L]^2 [T]^{-3} $

So we get three equations:

1. **Mass**: $ -a + c = 1 $ → $ c = a + 1 $
2. **Length**: $ 3a + b + d = 2 $
3. **Time**: $ -2a - b = -3 $ → $ 2a + b = 3 $

We are also given: $ b = d $

So substitute $ d = b $ into equation (2):

- Equation (2): $ 3a + b + b = 2 $ → $ 3a + 2b = 2 $

From equation (3): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Plug into equation (2):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
(-a) + 6 = 2 \\
-a = -4 \Rightarrow a = 4
$$

Then:

- $ b = 3 - 2a = 3 - 8 = -5 $
- $ d = b = -5 $
- $ c = a + 1 = 5 $

So the expression is:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Or:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But wait! Let’s double-check this against the **known quadrupole formula** for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary.

---

### Step 3: Compare with known result (as a sanity check)

The standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary with masses $ m_1 $, $ m_2 $, and **orbital separation** $ a $ is:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

For equal masses $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, total mass $ 2M $, so:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 (2M)}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

Now, in our problem, the **separation** is $ a = 2R $, so:

$$
L_{GW} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{64}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Exactly matches our derived expression!

So the interpretation of $ R $ as the orbital radius (i.e., half the separation) is consistent with the problem's wording and yields the correct known result when the standard formula is adjusted accordingly.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{L_{GW} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$","Assume the error upper bound (δ = 0).。In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass.

We are to use dimensional analysis (plus the given constant) to find the correct expression.

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical setup

In a binary system with two equal masses $ M $, each orbits the center of mass at a distance $ r = R/2 $, so the **separation between the two stars is $ a = R $**? Wait — need to clarify: The problem says ""circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass"". Since both stars are identical, each orbits the center of mass at radius $ R $, which would make the separation between them $ 2R $. But in standard astrophysical usage, the orbital separation (distance between the two bodies) is often denoted by $ a $, and each body orbits the center of mass at radius $ a/2 $. However, the problem explicitly says: ""two identical neutron stars [...] undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass."" So yes, **each star has orbital radius $ R $**, so the **separation between them is $ 2R $**.

But we must be cautious: In the standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary, the result is expressed in terms of the **orbital separation** (distance between the two bodies), usually denoted $ a $. So if the problem defines $ R $ as the distance from each star to the center of mass, then the actual separation is $ 2R $, and we must account for that when comparing or deriving.

However, the problem does **not** ask us to derive from first principles using quadrupole formula, but rather to **use dimensional analysis**, given that:

- $ L_{\text{GW}} \propto G^a c^b M^c R^d $
- The dimensionless prefactor is $ \frac{2}{5} $
- And **the exponents of $ c $ and $ R $ are equal**: i.e., $ b = d $

We also know the dimensions of all quantities:

- $ [L_{\text{GW}}] = \text{Energy}/\text{Time} = \mathrm{M L^2 T^{-3}} $
- $ [G] = \mathrm{M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}} $
- $ [c] = \mathrm{L T^{-1}} $
- $ [M] = \mathrm{M} $
- $ [R] = \mathrm{L} $

We assume the formula is of the form:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^a c^b M^c R^d
$$

with constraint $ b = d $. We'll solve for exponents $ a, b, c, d $ such that dimensions match.

---

### Step 2: Dimensional analysis

Write dimensions of RHS:

$$
[G^a] = \mathrm{M^{-a} L^{3a} T^{-2a}} \\
[c^b] = \mathrm{L^b T^{-b}} \\
[M^c] = \mathrm{M^c} \\
[R^d] = \mathrm{L^d}
$$

Multiply all together:

- Mass: $ -a + c $
- Length: $ 3a + b + d $
- Time: $ -2a - b $

Set equal to dimensions of $ L_{\text{GW}} = \mathrm{M^1 L^2 T^{-3}} $

So we get system:

1. Mass: $ -a + c = 1 $ → $ c = a + 1 $
2. Length: $ 3a + b + d = 2 $
3. Time: $ -2a - b = -3 $ → $ 2a + b = 3 $
4. Constraint: $ b = d $

Use (4) to replace $ d = b $ in (2):

→ $ 3a + b + b = 2 $ → $ 3a + 2b = 2 $

From (3): $ b = 3 - 2a $

Plug into above:

$ 3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 $  
→ $ 3a + 6 - 4a = 2 $  
→ $ -a + 6 = 2 $  
→ $ -a = -4 $ → $ a = 4 $

Then:

- From (3): $ b = 3 - 2*4 = 3 - 8 = -5 $
- So $ d = b = -5 $
- From (1): $ c = a + 1 = 5 $

So the expression is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} G^4 c^{-5} M^5 R^{-5}
$$

Or:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But wait — let’s double-check this against known results.

### Step 3: Compare with known GR formula

The standard formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary with masses $ m_1, m_2 $, separation $ a $, is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

For equal masses $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, total mass $ 2M $, so:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 (2M)}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

So the correct coefficient is $ \frac{64}{5} $, **not** $ \frac{2}{5} $, and it depends on the **separation** $ a $, not the orbital radius around the center of mass.

Now, in our problem, they say: “the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $ \frac{2}{5} $”. That suggests they are **defining** the constant in their version of the formula to be $ \frac{2}{5} $, perhaps absorbing other numerical factors (like powers of 2 from the separation definition) into the definition of $ R $.

Recall: If the problem defines $ R $ as the **separation** between the two stars (not the orbital radius about the center of mass), then the standard formula gives $ \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $. But they say the constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $, which is **32 times smaller**.

Alternatively, maybe they define $ R $ as the **semi-major axis of the relative orbit**, which in standard notation **is** the separation $ a $. Then the constant should be $ \frac{32}{5} \mu^2 M^3 / a^5 $ etc.

But here's another possibility: The problem is **not** asking us to reproduce the exact GR formula, but rather to **use dimensional analysis** with the given constraint (that $ c $ and $ R $ have same exponent) and the given constant $ \frac{2}{5} $, to find the functional form.

Given that, our dimensional analysis gave:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

This satisfies:

- Dimensions correct
- Exponent of $ c $ is -5, exponent of $ R $ is -5 → same power (satisfies condition)
- Includes $ G $, $ c $, $ M $, $ R $
- Uses given dimensionless constant

Therefore, **this must be the expected answer**, even if the numerical factor differs from the true GR result—because the problem explicitly says to use $ \frac{2}{5} $ as the constant.

But wait! Let's double-check whether $ R $ is separation or orbital radius.

Suppose the problem **intended** $ R $ to be the **separation** between the two stars. Then our analysis is fine.

But if $ R $ is the distance from each star to the center of mass (so separation = $ 2R $), then the true dependence would be $ (2R)^{-5} = 2^{-5} R^{-5} = \frac{1}{32} R^{-5} $. So if the standard formula gives $ \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{64}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $.

Ah! That matches **exactly**.

So: If the problem defines $ R $ as the **orbital radius around the center of mass** (so each star is at distance $ R $, separation = $ 2R $), then the standard GR formula becomes:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 (2R)^5} = \frac{64}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

Which matches both the constant **and** the dependence.

Therefore, everything is consistent if $ R $ is the orbital radius about the center of mass (as stated), and we use the standard GR formula.

Thus, the final expression is:

$$
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$

This satisfies all conditions:

- Derived via dimensional analysis (confirmed)
- Matches GR formula when accounting for definition of $ R $
- Uses given constant $ \frac{2}{5} $
- Powers of $ c $ and $ R $ are both -5 → same exponent

- General relativity gives a formula for $ L_{\text{GW}} $ that includes only one term with a dimensionless constant equal to $ \frac{2}{5} $.

---

### Step 1: Recall the standard quadrupole formula

In general relativity, the leading-order gravitational wave luminosity for a binary system in circular orbit is given by the **quadrupole formula**:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M_1^2 M_2^2 (M_1 + M_2)}{R^5}
$$

For two **identical** masses $ M_1 = M_2 = M $, this becomes:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{R^5}
$$

However, the problem says: **""the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $ \frac{2}{5} $""**, which is **not** the same as the standard $ \frac{32}{5} $. This suggests that either:

- The problem is using a simplified or rescaled version, or
- It defines $ R $ differently (e.g., separation vs orbital radius)

Let’s clarify the geometry.

---

### Step 2: Clarify the meaning of $ R $

The problem says: *""two identical neutron stars of mass $ M $ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass.""*

So each star orbits at radius $ R $ from the center of mass. Therefore, the **separation between the two stars** is:

$$
a = 2R
$$

In the standard formula, $ R $ (or often denoted $ a $) is the **separation**, not the orbital radius about the center of mass.

So if we plug in separation $ a = 2R $ into the standard formula:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{(2R)^5} = \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But the problem says the dimensionless constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $, not $ \frac{1}{5} $. So perhaps there's another convention.

Alternatively, maybe the problem **defines** the formula as:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \cdot \frac{G^? M^?}{c^? R^?}
$$

and wants us to **derive the exponents** using dimensional analysis, given that **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**.

---

### Step 3: Use dimensional analysis

We are to find an expression of the form:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) G^a M^b R^d c^d
$$

since **$ c $ and $ R $ are raised to the same power**, i.e., exponent of $ c $ = exponent of $ R $ = $ d $ (note: could be negative).

We know that luminosity $ L_{\text{GW}} $ has dimensions of **power**, i.e., energy per time:

$$
[L_{\text{GW}}] = [M L^2 T^{-3}]
$$

Now write dimensions of RHS:

- $ [G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2} $
- $ [M] = M $
- $ [R] = L $
- $ [c] = L T^{-1} $

So:

$$
[G^a M^b R^d c^d] = (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a \cdot M^b \cdot L^d \cdot (L T^{-1})^d
$$

Simplify:

- Mass: $ -a + b $
- Length: $ 3a + d + d = 3a + 2d $
- Time: $ -2a - d $

Set equal to dimensions of luminosity: $ M^1 L^2 T^{-3} $

So we get equations:

1. Mass: $ -a + b = 1 $ → $ b = a + 1 $
2. Length: $ 3a + 2d = 2 $
3. Time: $ -2a - d = -3 $ → $ 2a + d = 3 $

Now solve equations (2) and (3):

From (3): $ d = 3 - 2a $

Plug into (2):

$$
3a + 2(3 - 2a) = 2 \\
3a + 6 - 4a = 2 \\
-a + 6 = 2 \\
a = 4
$$

Then:

- $ d = 3 - 2(4) = 3 - 8 = -5 $
- $ b = a + 1 = 5 $

So the expression is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) G^4 M^5 R^{-5} c^{-5}
= \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

This matches the earlier result **except** for the numerical factor: standard GR gives $ \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5} $, where $ a $ is separation. If $ a = R $ (i.e., if the problem had defined $ R $ as separation), then standard result is $ \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $. But here, using the problem's statement that the constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $, and using dimensional analysis with the constraint that $ c $ and $ R $ have same exponent, we get:

$$
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}
$$

But wait! Let's double-check consistency with the orbital setup.

If each star orbits at radius $ R $, separation is $ 2R $. Then standard formula gives:

$$
L = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^5}{(2R)^5} = \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{1}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

But problem says constant is $ \frac{2}{5} $, so **twice** that.

Possibility: Maybe they define reduced mass or use total mass differently?

Alternative approach: Use quadrupole formula directly.

---

### Step 4: Derive from quadrupole formula (optional verification)

Gravitational wave luminosity (averaged over orbit) for a circular binary:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G}{c^5} \mu^2 a^4 \omega^6
$$

Where:
- $ \mu = \frac{M_1 M_2}{M_1 + M_2} = \frac{M}{2} $ (for equal masses)
- $ a $ = separation = $ 2R $
- $ \omega^2 = \frac{G(M_1 + M_2)}{a^3} = \frac{2GM}{(2R)^3} = \frac{2GM}{8R^3} = \frac{GM}{4R^3} $

Now compute:

- $ \mu^2 = \frac{M^2}{4} $
- $ a^4 = (2R)^4 = 16 R^4 $
- $ \omega^6 = \left( \frac{GM}{4R^3} \right)^3 = \frac{G^3 M^3}{64 R^9} $

Multiply:

$$
L = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G}{c^5} \cdot \frac{M^2}{4} \cdot 16 R^4 \cdot \frac{G^3 M^3}{64 R^9}
= \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5} \cdot \frac{16}{4 \cdot 64} \cdot \frac{1}{R^5}
$$

Compute coefficient: $ \frac{16}{4 \cdot 64} = \frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16} $

So:

$$
L = \frac{32}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{16} \cdot \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}
$$

✅ **Exactly matches!**

So the key was: using **orbital radius** $ R $ (distance from center of mass), not separation. Then the standard formula **does** yield a prefactor of $ \frac{2}{5} $ when expressed in terms of $ R $.

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5}}

We are to find an expression for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $, the rate at which the orbital separation (radius of each star’s orbit about the center of mass) shrinks due to energy loss via gravitational radiation.

### Step 1: Total Orbital Energy

For a binary system with two equal masses $ M $, orbiting their common center of mass in circular orbits of radius $ R $ (so the separation between the two stars is $ 2R $), the total Newtonian orbital energy is:

- Kinetic energy: Each star has speed $ v $, and for circular motion under Newtonian gravity:
  $$
  \frac{G M^2}{(2R)^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R} \Rightarrow \frac{G M}{4 R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R} \Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M}{4 R}
  $$
  So kinetic energy of each star: $ \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = \frac{1}{2} M \cdot \frac{G M}{4 R} = \frac{G M^2}{8 R} $

  Total kinetic energy (two stars): $ K = 2 \cdot \frac{G M^2}{8 R} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R} $

- Potential energy: Gravitational potential energy between two masses separated by $ 2R $:
  $$
  U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}
  $$

- Total orbital energy:
  $$
  E = K + U = \frac{G M^2}{4 R} - \frac{G M^2}{2 R} = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
  $$

So:
$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
$$

### Step 2: Energy Loss Rate

The system loses energy via gravitational waves at rate $ L_{\text{GW}} $. So:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using chain rule:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1} \Rightarrow \frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

Set this equal to $ -L_{\text{GW}} $:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $

Multiply both sides by $ \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2} $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
= -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}

### Step 1: Total mechanical energy of the binary system

In Newtonian gravity, the total mechanical energy $ E $ of a circular binary system is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. For two bodies of mass $ M $ orbiting their center of mass at separation $ 2R $ (since each is at distance $ R $ from the center), the **orbital separation** between the two stars is $ a = 2R $. However, in many treatments of binary systems, $ R $ is used to denote the **separation between the two bodies**, not the distance from the center of mass. So we must be careful.

But the problem states: ""two identical neutron stars of mass $ M $ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $ R $ around their center of mass."" That means **each star orbits at radius $ R $**, so the **separation between them is $ 2R $**.

However, the given expression for $ L_{\text{GW}} $ is:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5}
$$

We must check whether this formula assumes $ R $ is the **separation** or the **orbital radius about the center of mass**.

Let’s recall the standard quadrupole formula for gravitational wave luminosity from a circular binary with masses $ m_1 $, $ m_2 $, and **separation** $ a $:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{m_1^2 m_2^2 (m_1 + m_2)}{a^5}
$$

For equal masses $ m_1 = m_2 = M $, total mass $ 2M $, so:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5} \frac{G^4}{c^5} \frac{M^4 (2M)}{a^5} = \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 a^5}
$$

Now compare with the given expression:

$$
L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

This is **much smaller** than the standard result unless $ R $ is not the separation. Suppose instead that the problem defines $ R $ as the **separation** $ a $. Then the standard formula gives $ \frac{64}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $, but the problem says $ \frac{2}{5} \frac{G^4 M^5}{c^5 R^5} $. That’s a discrepancy by a factor of 32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a simplified or scaled version, or there's a typo. But since the problem explicitly provides $ L_{\text{GW}} = \frac{2G^4 M^5}{5R^5 c^5} $, we must **use this expression as given**, regardless of standard factors.

So proceed with the given $ L_{\text{GW}} $, and assume that the **total orbital energy** $ E $ is expressed in terms of the same $ R $ — the radius of each star’s orbit around the center of mass.

---

### Step 2: Express total orbital energy in terms of $ R $

Each star moves in a circle of radius $ R $, so the separation between them is $ 2R $. The gravitational potential energy is:

$$
U = -\frac{G M^2}{2R}
$$

The orbital speed $ v $ of each star is determined by centripetal force = gravitational force:

Gravitational force on one star: $ F = \frac{G M^2}{(2R)^2} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} $

This must equal the centripetal force: $ M \frac{v^2}{R} $

So:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} = \frac{M v^2}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{G M}{4 R}
$$

Then kinetic energy of both stars:

$$
K = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = M v^2 = M \cdot \frac{G M}{4 R} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R}
$$

Total mechanical energy:

$$
E = K + U = \frac{G M^2}{4 R} - \frac{G M^2}{2 R} = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
$$

So:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4 R}
$$

This is the total energy of the system in terms of the given $ R $ (distance from center of mass).

---

### Step 3: Relate energy loss to change in radius

The system loses energy via gravitational waves, so:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

(The negative sign indicates energy is leaving the system.)

We have:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1}
$$

Differentiate with respect to time:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{G M^2}{4} (-1) R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

Set equal to $ -L_{\text{GW}} $:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $:

Multiply both sides by $ 4 R^2 / (G M^2) $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}
= - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}
$$

---

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}

### Step 1: Total Mechanical Energy of the Binary System

### Step 2: Relate Energy Loss to Change in Radius

The system loses energy via gravitational radiation, so:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -L_{\text{GW}}
$$

Now compute $ \frac{dE}{dt} $ using the expression for $ E $:

$$
E = -\frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-1}
\Rightarrow \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{G M^2}{4} R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt}
$$

(Note the sign: derivative of $ -R^{-1} $ is $ +R^{-2} \frac{dR}{dt} $)

Set this equal to $ -L_{\text{GW}} $:

$$
\frac{G M^2}{4 R^2} \frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ \frac{dR}{dt} $

Multiply both sides by $ 4 R^2 / (G M^2) $:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{2 G^4 M^5}{5 R^5 c^5} \cdot \frac{4 R^2}{G M^2}

$$

$$
\boxed{\frac{dR}{dt} = - \frac{8 G^3 M^3}{5 c^5 R^3}}
