The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by the formula \( A = 4\pi R^2 \), where \( R \) is the radius of the star.

The modified Stefan-Boltzmann law can be written as:

\[ A = 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi (2.66538 \times 10^{11})^2 \]
\[ A = 4\pi (7.1043524444 \times 10^{22}) \]
\[ A = 4 \times 3.141592653589793 \times 7.1043524444 \times 10^{22} \]

\[ A \approx 8.92253164557 \times 10^{23} \text{ square meters} \]

Next, calculate the total radiative power \( P \):
\[ P = A \sqrt{T} = 8.92253164557 \times 10^{23} \times \sqrt{35235.19} \]
\[ P = 8.92253164557 \times 10^{23} \times 187.710345653 \]

 (non-visible light)","To solve the problem, we start by understanding the modified Wien's displacement law. According to the problem, the peak wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{peak}}\) is inversely proportional to the square root of the temperature \(T\). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{T}}
\]

where \(k\) is a constant. To find the value of \(k\), we need a reference point. However, since the problem does not provide a reference point, we will assume that the constant \(k\) is such that the relationship holds true for the given temperature. We are given that the temperature \(T = 35027.66 \, \text{K}\). We need to find the peak wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{peak}}\).

Let's assume the constant \(k\) is known or can be determined from other data. For the purpose of this problem, we will focus on the relationship and the calculation.

Given:
\[
T = 35027.66 \, \text{K}
\]

We need to find \(\lambda_{\text{peak}}\). Using the modified Wien's displacement law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{35027.66}}
\]

First, we calculate the square root of the temperature:

\[
\sqrt{35027.66} \approx 187.157
\]

Now, we need the value of \(k\). Since the problem does not provide \(k\), we will assume it is a known constant. For the sake of this example, let's assume \(k\) is a known value. If we had the value of \(k\), we would substitute it into the equation:

\[
\lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{k}{187.157}
\]

Without the value of \(k\), we cannot determine the exact numerical value of \(\lambda_{\text{peak}}\). However, the process to find it is clear.

If we assume \(k\) is a known constant, the final answer would be:

\[
\lambda_{\text{peak}} = \frac{k}{187.157}
\]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \(k\), we cannot provide a numerical final answer. However, the process to find the peak wavelength is:

\[

   The effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} \) is given as 29787 K. The square root of \( T_{\text{eff}} \) is:
   \[
   \sqrt{T_{\text{eff}}} = \sqrt{29787} \approx 172.5891132765365

3. **Calculate the total luminosity:**
   According to the redefined Stefan-Boltzmann law, the total luminosity \( L \) is the product of the surface area and the square root of the effective temperature:
   \[
   L = A \times \sqrt{T_{\text{eff}}}
   \]

   \[
   L \approx 2.7225806451612903 \times 10^{20} \times 172.5891132765365 \approx 469.69399999999994 \times 10^{20} \approx 4.69694 \times 10^{22}

 Perihelion distance = 3.18498e+12 m
 Aphelion distance = 5.44474e+12 m","Perihelion distance = 3.18498e+12 m
 Aphelion distance = 5.44474e+12 m","To calculate the orbital extreme distances using the given values of the semi-major axis \(a\) and the eccentricity \(e\), we will use the formulas for perihelion and aphelion distances. The perihelion distance is given by \(a(1 - e)\) and the aphelion distance is given by \(a(1 + e)\).

Given:
- Semi-major axis \(a = 4.31486 \times 10^{12}\) meters
- Eccentricity \(e = 0.51172\)

First, we calculate the perihelion distance:
\[

\[

10,0.45,"Assume Kepler's Second Law is redefined such that the areal velocity of an orbiting body is proportional to the product of its instantaneous orbital radius and the square of its orbital eccentricity.

Verify the conservation of areal velocity for the orbit described below:
- Semi-major axis a = 3.84813e+12 m
- Eccentricity e = 0.15047
- Perihelion distance r_peri = 3.26911e+12 m","step1: State the modified Kepler's Second Law:
 The areal velocity is proportional to r × e² instead of being constant.

step2: Substitute perihelion values into the modified definition:
 r_peri = 3.26911e+12 m
 e = 0.15047

step3: Evaluate the modified areal velocity at perihelion:

 dA/dt ∝ 3.26911e+12 × (0.15047)²
 dA/dt ∝ 7.40166e+10 (arbitrary units)

step4: Discussion of conservation:
 Under this modified law, the areal velocity explicitly depends on the instantaneous orbital radius r. Since r varies along the orbit, the areal velocity will also vary.

final_answer:
 The modified areal velocity evaluated at perihelion is shown above, and it is not conserved over time because it depends on r, which changes throughout the orbit.","The modified areal velocity evaluated at perihelion is shown above, and it is not conserved over time because it depends on r, which changes throughout the orbit.","To verify the conservation of areal velocity for the given orbit, we need to use the redefined Kepler's Second Law, which states that the areal velocity \( \frac{dA}{dt} \) of an orbiting body is proportional to the product of its instantaneous orbital radius \( r \) and the square of its orbital eccentricity \( e \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = k r e^2
\]

where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.

First, we need to find the relationship between the radius \( r \) and the true anomaly \( \theta \) for an elliptical orbit. The radius \( r \) at any point in the orbit is given by:

\[
r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta}
\]

where \( a \) is the semi-major axis and \( e \) is the eccentricity. The areal velocity \( \frac{dA}{dt} \) can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum \( L \) and the mass \( m \) of the orbiting body as:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m}
\]

For a given orbit, the angular momentum \( L \) is constant, so the areal velocity is also constant. According to the redefined Kepler's Second Law, the areal velocity should be proportional to \( r e^2 \). Therefore, we need to check if \( r e^2 \) is constant.

Substituting the expression for \( r \) into \( r e^2 \), we get:

\[
r e^2 = \frac{a(1-e^2)e^2}{1+e\cos\theta}
\]

Since \( a \), \( e \), and \( e^2 \) are constants, the expression \( r e^2 \) is not constant because it depends on \( \cos\theta \). Therefore, the areal velocity as defined by the redefined Kepler's Second Law is not constant.

However, the problem asks us to verify the conservation of areal velocity for the given orbit, which implies that we need to check the areal velocity at a specific point in the orbit, such as the perihelion. At perihelion, \( \theta = 0 \), so \( \cos\theta = 1 \). The radius at perihelion \( r_{\text{peri}} \) is given by:

\[
r_{\text{peri}} = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e}
\]

Given the values:
- Semi-major axis \( a = 3.84813 \times 10^{12} \) m
- Eccentricity \( e = 0.15047 \)
- Perihelion distance \( r_{\text{peri}} = 3.26911 \times 10^{12} \) m

we can verify that:

\[
r_{\text{peri}} = \frac{3.84813 \times 10^{12} (1 - 0.15047^2)}{1 + 0.15047} = \frac{3.84813 \times 10^{12} \times 0.97735}{1.15047} \approx 3.26911 \times 10^{12} \text{ m}
\]

Thus, the given perihelion distance is consistent with the orbit parameters. The areal velocity at perihelion is:

\[
\frac{dA}{dt} = k r_{\text{peri}} e^2
\]

Since \( r_{\text{peri}} \) and \( e^2 \) are constants, the areal velocity at perihelion is constant. Therefore, the conservation of areal velocity for the given orbit is verified.

   - Mass \( M = 5.84484 \times 10^{26} \) kg
   - Radius \( r = 5.84814 \times 10^7 \) m

2. Substitute these values into the formula:
   \[

3. Calculate the square of the radius \( r \):
   \[
   r^2 = (5.84814 \times 10^7)^2 = 3.4200055396 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}^2
   \]

4. Substitute \( M \) and \( r^2 \) back into the formula:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{5.84484 \times 10^{26}}{3.4200055396 \times 10^{15}}}
   \]

5. Simplify the expression inside the square root:
   \[

   \]

6. Take the square root of the result:
   \[
   v = 4.13404 \times 10^5 \text{ m/s}
   \]

\[ d^3 = (2.96479 \times 10^9)^3 = 2.6094 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^3 \]

Next, calculate \( \sqrt{R} \):

\[ R_L = R_s \left( \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_p} \right)^{1/3} \]

First, we need to find the stellar radius \( R_s \). We can use the relationship between the mass \( M \) and the density \( \rho \) of a sphere, which is given by:

\[ M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho \]

For the planet, we have:

\[ M_p = \frac{4}{3} \pi R_p^3 \rho_p \]

For the star, we have:

\[ M_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi R_s^3 \rho_s \]

The critical distance \( a \) is the distance at which the Roche lobe radius \( R_L \) is equal to the distance from the star to the planet. Therefore, we can write:

\[ a = R_L = R_s \left( \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_p} \right)^{1/3} \]

However, we don't have the stellar mass \( M_s \) or radius \( R_s \) directly. Instead, we can use the relationship between the Roche lobe radius and the semi-major axis \( a \) of the planet's orbit, which is given by:

\[ R_L \approx a \left( \frac{M_p}{3 M_s} \right)^{1/3} \]

Since \( R_L = a \) at the critical distance, we have:

\[ a \approx a \left( \frac{M_p}{3 M_s} \right)^{1/3} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 1 \approx \left( \frac{M_p}{3 M_s} \right)^{1/3} \]

However, we can use the density relationship to find the critical distance directly. The critical distance \( a \) is given by:

\[ a = R_p \left( \frac{3 \rho_p}{\rho_s} \right)^{1/3} \]

Substituting the given values \( R_p = 1.20474 \times 10^8 \) m, \( \rho_p = 11502.7 \) kg/m³, and \( \rho_s = 2710.4 \) kg/m³, we get:

\[ a = 1.20474 \times 10^8 \left( \frac{3 \times 11502.7}{2710.4} \right)^{1/3} \]

First, calculate the ratio inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{3 \times 11502.7}{2710.4} = \frac{34508.1}{2710.4} \approx 12.732 \]

Now, take the cube root of 12.732:

\[ \left( 12.732 \right)^{1/3} \approx 2.334 \]

Finally, multiply by the planetary radius:

\[ a \approx 1.20474 \times 10^8 \times 2.334 \approx 2.81 \times 10^8 \text{ m} \]

\[ H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_m + \frac{\Lambda}{3} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the Hubble parameter,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( \rho_m \) is the matter density,
- \( \Lambda \) is the cosmological constant.

First, we need to find the Hubble parameter \( H \) using the given values:
- \( \rho_m = 1.592 \times 10^{-27} \) kg/m³,
- \( \Lambda = 7.694 \times 10^{-53} \) m⁻².

The gravitational constant \( G \) is approximately \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \) m³/(kg·s²). Substituting these values into the Friedmann equation, we get:

\[ H^2 = \frac{8\pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})}{3} (1.592 \times 10^{-27}) + \frac{7.694 \times 10^{-53}}{3} \]

First, we calculate the term involving the matter density:

\[ \frac{8\pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})}{3} (1.592 \times 10^{-27}) = \frac{8 \times 3.14159 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.592 \times 10^{-27}}{3} \approx \frac{267.24 \times 10^{-38}}{3} \approx 89.08 \times 10^{-38} \approx 8.908 \times 10^{-37} \]

Next, we calculate the term involving the cosmological constant:

\[ \frac{7.694 \times 10^{-53}}{3} \approx 2.565 \times 10^{-53} \]

Adding these two terms together gives:

\[ H^2 \approx 8.908 \times 10^{-37} + 2.565 \times 10^{-53} \approx 8.908 \times 10^{-37} \]

Since the term involving the cosmological constant is much smaller than the term involving the matter density, it can be approximated as:

\[ H^2 \approx 8.908 \times 10^{-37} \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ H \approx \sqrt{8.908 \times 10^{-37}} \approx 9.44 \times 10^{-19} \text{ s}^{-1} \]

The Hubble parameter \( H \) is related to the scale factor \( a \) and the time \( t \) by the equation:

\[ H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \]

where \( \dot{a} \) is the time derivative of the scale factor. For a constant Hubble parameter, the scale factor grows exponentially with time:

\[ a(t) = a_0 e^{Ht} \]

Given that the scale factor \( a = 8.81 \) at the current time, we can use this to find the age of the universe. However, the problem does not ask for the age of the universe, so we will stop here.

final_answer:
 The redefined critical density of the universe is 6.149e-54",The redefined critical density of the universe is 6.149e-54,"To calculate the critical density of the universe using the redefined concept, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the redefined critical density formula:**
   The redefined critical density \(\rho_{\text{critical}}\) is given by:
   \[
   \rho_{\text{critical}} = \frac{H^3}{k}
   \]
   where \(H\) is the Hubble parameter and \(k\) is a fixed proportionality constant.

2. **Identify the given values:**
   The Hubble parameter \(H\) is given as \(1.832 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}\).

3. **Determine the fixed proportionality constant \(k\):**
   Since the problem does not specify the value of \(k\), we will assume it is a known constant. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we will use the standard critical density formula to find a typical value of \(k\).

   The standard critical density formula is:
   \[
   \rho_{\text{critical}} = \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}
   \]
   where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, approximately \(6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2}\).

   Using the standard Hubble parameter \(H_0 = 67.4 \text{ km/s/Mpc} = 2.177 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}\), the critical density is:
   \[
   \rho_{\text{critical}} = \frac{3 \times (2.177 \times 10^{-18})^2}{8\pi \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 8.5 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/m}^3
   \]

   If we use the redefined critical density formula with \(H = 2.177 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}\), we get:
   \[
   \rho_{\text{critical}} = \frac{(2.177 \times 10^{-18})^3}{k}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \(\rho_{\text{critical}}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{(2.177 \times 10^{-18})^3}{k} \approx 8.5 \times 10^{-27}
   \]
   Solving for \(k\):
   \[
   k \approx \frac{(2.177 \times 10^{-18})^3}{8.5 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10}
   \]

4. **Calculate the redefined critical density with the given Hubble parameter:**
   Using \(H = 1.832 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}\) and \(k \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10}\):
   \[
   \rho_{\text{critical}} = \frac{(1.832 \times 10^{-18})^3}{1.1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx \frac{6.1 \times 10^{-54}}{1.1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{-44} \text{ kg/m}^3
   \]

Therefore, the critical density of the universe is:
\[
\boxed{5.5 \times 10^{-44} \text{ kg/m}^3}
\]"

final_answer:
 Age of the Universe t₀ = 25.75 Gyr",Age of the Universe t₀ = 25.75 Gyr,"To find the age of the Universe using the redefined formula, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the given values:
   - Matter density parameter, \(\Omega_m = 0.216\)
   - Dark energy density parameter, \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.784\)
   - Hubble constant, \(H_0 = 67.8 \text{ km/s/Mpc}\)

2. Substitute these values into the redefined formula for the age of the Universe:
   \[
   \text{Age} = \frac{1}{H_0} \times (\Omega_m + 2\Omega_\Lambda)
   \]

3. Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \Omega_m + 2\Omega_\Lambda = 0.216 + 2 \times 0.784 = 0.216 + 1.568 = 1.784
   \]

4. Calculate the inverse of the Hubble constant \(H_0\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{H_0} = \frac{1}{67.8 \text{ km/s/Mpc}}
   \]

5. Convert the inverse Hubble constant into units of time. Since 1 Mpc is approximately \(3.0857 \times 10^{19}\) km, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{H_0} = \frac{1}{67.8 \text{ km/s/Mpc}} \times \frac{3.0857 \times 10^{19} \text{ km}}{1 \text{ Mpc}} \times \frac{1 \text{ s}}{3.1536 \times 10^7 \text{ s/yr}} \approx \frac{3.0857 \times 10^{19}}{67.8 \times 3.1536 \times 10^7} \text{ years}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{3.0857 \times 10^{19}}{67.8 \times 3.1536 \times 10^7} \approx \frac{3.0857 \times 10^{12}}{213.66} \approx 14.44 \times 10^9 \text{ years} = 14.44 \text{ billion years}
   \]

6. Multiply this result by the sum of the density parameters:
   \[
   \text{Age} = 14.44 \text{ billion years} \times 1.784 \approx 25.76 \text{ billion years}
   \]

Therefore, the age of the Universe is \(\boxed{25.76 \text{ billion years}}\)."

\[ D_A = \frac{d}{\theta} \]

where:
- \( d \) is the physical diameter of the object in parsecs (pc),
- \( \theta \) is the angular diameter in radians.

First, we need to convert the angular diameter from arcseconds to radians. There are 60 arcseconds in an arcminute and 60 arcminutes in a degree, so there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) arcseconds in a degree. Additionally, there are \( \pi \) radians in 180 degrees, so there are \( \frac{\pi}{180 \times 3600} = \frac{\pi}{648000} \) radians in an arcsecond.

Given that the angular diameter \( \theta = 19.88 \) arcseconds, we convert it to radians as follows:

The redefined relation states that the ratio of scale factors is given by \((1 + z)^2\).

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Identify the observed redshift \(z\).
2. Use the redefined relation to find the ratio of scale factors.

Given:
- Observed redshift \(z = 7.137\)
- Present-day scale factor \(a(t_0) = 1.0\)

The redefined relation for the ratio of scale factors is:
\[
\frac{a(t_0)}{a(t)} = (1 + z)^2
\]

Since \(a(t_0) = 1.0\), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{a(t)} = (1 + z)^2
\]

Therefore, the scale factor at the time of emission \(a(t)\) is:
\[
a(t) = \frac{1}{(1 + z)^2}
\]

Now, substitute the observed redshift \(z = 7.137\) into the equation:
\[
a(t) = \frac{1}{(1 + 7.137)^2} = \frac{1}{8.137^2} = \frac{1}{66.210769} \approx 0.015104

2. Convert the luminosity from solar luminosities to watts. The solar luminosity \( L_{\odot} \) is approximately \( 3.828 \times 10^{26} \text{ W} \). Therefore, the luminosity \( L \) in watts is:
   \[
   L = 213394.277 \times 3.828 \times 10^{26} \text{ W}
   \]
   Calculating this, we get:
   \[
   L \approx 8.164 \times 10^{31} \text{ W}
   \]

3. Substitute the values of \( L \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \) into the inverse-cube law equation \( F = \frac{L}{D^3} \) and solve for \( D \):
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = \frac{L}{D^3}
   \]
   \[
   5.443 \times 10^{-21} = \frac{8.164 \times 10^{31}}{D^3}
   \]
   Rearrange to solve for \( D^3 \):
   \[
   D^3 = \frac{8.164 \times 10^{31}}{5.443 \times 10^{-21}}
   \]
   \[
   D^3 \approx 1.5 \times 10^{52}
   \]
   Take the cube root of both sides to find \( D \):
   \[
   D \approx \sqrt[3]{1.5 \times 10^{52}} \approx 5.31 \times 10^{17} \text{ meters}
   \]

4. Convert the distance from meters to parsecs. Since 1 parsec is approximately \( 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \) meters, we have:
   \[
   D \approx \frac{5.31 \times 10^{17}}{3.0857 \times 10^{16}} \approx 17.21 \text{ parsecs}

Next, calculate the square of this difference:
\[ (\nu - \nu_0)^2 = (5 \times 10^7)^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{15} \text{ Hz}^2 \]

Then, calculate the square of the line width:
\[ 2\sigma^2 = 2 \times (9.771 \times 10^9)^2 = 2 \times 9.5472441 \times 10^{19} = 1.90944882 \times 10^{20} \text{ Hz}^2 \]

The formula for the cooling rate is:
\[ \Lambda = n(\text{H}_2) \cdot n(\text{X}) \cdot \sqrt{T} \cdot f(J) \]
where \( f(J) = J \).

Given values:
- \( n(\text{H}_2) = 6.407 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}^{-3} \)
- \( n(\text{X}) = 4.016 \times 10^9 \, \text{m}^{-3} \)
- \( T = 402.9 \, \text{K} \)
- \( J = 1, 2, 3 \) (for the transitions 1–0, 2–1, 3–2)

We will calculate the cooling rate for each value of \( J \).

### For \( J = 1 \):
\[ f(1) = 1 \]
\[ \Lambda_1 = 6.407 \times 10^{10} \cdot 4.016 \times 10^9 \cdot \sqrt{402.9} \cdot 1 \]
First, calculate \( \sqrt{402.9} \):
\[ \sqrt{402.9} \approx 20.0723 \]
Now, substitute this value into the formula:
\[ \Lambda_1 = 6.407 \times 10^{10} \cdot 4.016 \times 10^9 \cdot 20.0723 \]
\[ \Lambda_1 = 6.407 \cdot 4.016 \cdot 20.0723 \cdot 10^{19} \]
\[ \Lambda_1 \approx 514.94 \cdot 10^{19} \]
\[ \Lambda_1 \approx 5.1494 \times 10^{21} \, \text{W/m}^3 \]

### For \( J = 2 \):
\[ f(2) = 2 \]
\[ \Lambda_2 = 6.407 \times 10^{10} \cdot 4.016 \times 10^9 \cdot \sqrt{402.9} \cdot 2 \]
\[ \Lambda_2 = 2 \cdot 5.1494 \times 10^{21} \]
\[ \Lambda_2 \approx 1.0299 \times 10^{22} \, \text{W/m}^3 \]

### For \( J = 3 \):
\[ f(3) = 3 \]
\[ \Lambda_3 = 6.407 \times 10^{10} \cdot 4.016 \times 10^9 \cdot \sqrt{402.9} \cdot 3 \]
\[ \Lambda_3 = 3 \cdot 5.1494 \times 10^{21} \]
\[ \Lambda_3 \approx 1.5448 \times 10^{22} \, \text{W/m}^3 \]

\]

where:
- \( n_{i+1} \) is the number density of the next ionization state,
- \( n_i \) is the number density of the current ionization state,
- \( g_{i+1} \) is the degeneracy of the next ionization state,
- \( g_i \) is the degeneracy of the current ionization state,
- \( m_e \) is the mass of an electron,
- \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature,
- \( h \) is the Planck constant,
- \( \chi_i \) is the ionization energy.

Given the values:
- \( T = 5791.8 \) K,
- \( \chi_i = 14.61 \) eV,
- \( g_i = 4 \),
- \( g_{i+1} = 2 \),
- \( n_e = 9.564 \times 10^{19} \) m\(^{-3}\),

we need to find the ratio \( \frac{n_{i+1}}{n_i} \).

First, we convert the ionization energy from eV to Joules. Since \( 1 \) eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) J, we have:

\[
\chi_i = 14.61 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 2.341 \times 10^{-18} \text{ J}
\]

Next, we substitute the known values into the Saha-Boltzmann equation. The constants are:
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \) kg,
- \( k_B = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \) J/K,
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) J s.

The equation becomes:

\]

First, we calculate the exponent:

\[
-\frac{2.341 \times 10^{-18}}{1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 5791.8} = -\frac{2.341 \times 10^{-18}}{7.999 \times 10^{-20}} = -29.26
\]

Next, we calculate the prefactor:

\[
\frac{2}{4} \frac{2 \pi (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.381 \times 10^{-23})(5791.8)}{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 \pi (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.381 \times 10^{-23})(5791.8)}{4.390 \times 10^{-67}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{141.1 \times 10^{-54}}{4.390 \times 10^{-67}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.214 \times 10^{13} = 1.607 \times 10^{13}
\]

Now, we combine the prefactor with the exponent:

\[
\frac{n_{i+1}}{n_i} = 1.607 \times 10^{13} \exp(-29.26) = 1.607 \times 10^{13} \times 1.34 \times 10^{-13} = 2.15

Next, we calculate the magnitude \( r_{12} \):

\[
r_{12} = \sqrt{(-57480832.38578894)^2 + (10470124.34941241)^2} = \sqrt{3.30394466 \times 10^{15} + 1.09623566 \times 10^{14}} = \sqrt{3.41356823 \times 10^{15}} = 58425669.9694 \text{ m}

4. Calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \Omega^2 r^2 \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \Omega^2 r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (8.817 \times 10^{-15})^2 \times (1.7903 \times 10^{20})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 77.74 \times 10^{-30} \times 3.20512409 \times 10^{40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 249.1 \times 10^{10} = 1.2455 \times 10^{12} \text{ J/kg} \]

This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ P = k \frac{\gamma^2}{\rho} \]

where \( k \) is a proportionality constant. For the purpose of this problem, we will assume that the proportionality constant \( k \) is such that the formula directly gives the power in the appropriate units without additional constants. The given values are:

\[ \rho = 3.220 \times 10^5 \text{ m} \]
\[ \gamma = 9.759 \times 10^8 \]

\]

Now, we substitute these values into the Einstein radius formula:

\[

First, we calculate the numerator inside the square root:

\[
4 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 4.6528398 \times 10^{41} = 1.231999 \times 10^{32}

Next, we calculate the denominator inside the square root:

\[
(2.99792458 \times 10^8)^2 = 8.987551787368176 \times 10^{16}
\]
\[
5.3666992 \times 10^{25} \times 6.4736992 \times 10^{25} = 3.470869 \times 10^{51}

\[
8.987551787368176 \times 10^{16} \times 3.470869 \times 10^{51} = 3.119999 \times 10^{68}

\[

\]

To convert radians to arcseconds, we use the fact that \( 1 \text{ radian} = 206264.806 \) arcseconds:

\[
\theta_E = 6.64 \times 10^{-6} \times 206264.806 = 1.37 \text{ arcseconds}
\]

Therefore, the Einstein radius is:

\[

- \( n = 9.481 \times 10^{19} \, \text{m}^{-3} \)
- \( v = 2.884 \times 10^5 \, \text{m/s} \)

First, we need to calculate the square of the particle velocity \( v^2 \):

\[ v^2 = (2.884 \times 10^5)^2 = 2.884^2 \times (10^5)^2 = 8.317456 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \]

1. **Convert the Gregorian date to the Julian Day Number (JDN):**
   The Julian Day Number is the integer part of the Julian Date, representing the number of days since noon on January 1, 4713 BC.

2. **Convert the time to a fraction of a day:**
   The time 07:23:12 needs to be converted to a fraction of a day.

3. **Add the fraction of the day to the Julian Day Number to get the Julian Date:**

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Convert the Gregorian date to the Julian Day Number (JDN)

The formula to convert a Gregorian date (Y, M, D) to the Julian Day Number is:
\[ JDN = A + B + C + D + E \]
where:
\[ A = \left\lfloor \frac{14 - M}{12} \right\rfloor \]
\[ B = D + 12M - 362 - 1461 \left( \left\lfloor \frac{Y + 4800 + A}{4} \right\rfloor \right) \]
\[ C = 306 \left( \left\lfloor \frac{14 - M}{12} \right\rfloor \right) \]
\[ D = \left\lfloor \frac{Y + 4900 + A}{100} \right\rfloor \]
\[ E = \left\lfloor \frac{Y + 4900 + A}{400} \right\rfloor \]

For the date 2031-9-5:
\[ Y = 2031, M = 9, D = 5 \]
\[ A = \left\lfloor \frac{14 - 9}{12} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5}{12} \right\rfloor = 0 \]
\[ B = 5 + 12 \times 9 - 362 - 1461 \left( \left\lfloor \frac{2031 + 4800 + 0}{4} \right\rfloor \right) = 5 + 108 - 362 - 1461 \left( \left\lfloor \frac{6831}{4} \right\rfloor \right) = 5 + 108 - 362 - 1461 \times 1707 = 5 + 108 - 362 - 2490007 = -2490256 \]
\[ C = 306 \left( \left\lfloor \frac{14 - 9}{12} \right\rfloor \right) = 306 \times 0 = 0 \]
\[ D = \left\lfloor \frac{2031 + 4900 + 0}{100} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{6931}{100} \right\rfloor = 69 \]
\[ E = \left\lfloor \frac{2031 + 4900 + 0}{400} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{6931}{400} \right\rfloor = 17 \]
\[ JDN = -2490256 + 69 + 17 = -2490170 \]

### Step 2: Convert the time to a fraction of a day

The time 07:23:12 needs to be converted to a fraction of a day:
\[ \text{Fraction of the day} = \frac{7 \times 3600 + 23 \times 60 + 12}{86400} = \frac{25392}{86400} = 0.294 \]

### Step 3: Add the fraction of the day to the Julian Day Number to get the Julian Date

\[ JD = JDN + \text{Fraction of the day} = -2490170 + 0.294 = -2490169.706 \]

Therefore, the Julian Date (JD) for the date 2031-9-5 07:23:12 is:
\[ \boxed{-2490169.706} \]"

where:
- GST is the Greenwich Sidereal Time in hours,
- \(\lambda\) is the longitude in degrees,
- the time difference is the difference in hours between the local time and the time at the prime meridian (Greenwich).

Given:
- GST = 18.29 hours,
- \(\lambda\) = 61.38°,
- time difference = -0.66 hours.

First, we convert the longitude from degrees to hours. Since there are 15 degrees in an hour, we have:

\[ \frac{\lambda}{15} = \frac{61.38}{15} = 4.092 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{LST} = 18.29 + 4.092 - 0.66 \]

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction:

\[ \text{LST} = 18.29 + 4.092 = 22.382 \]
\[ \text{LST} = 22.382 - 0.66 = 21.722 \]

Therefore, the Local Sidereal Time (LST) is:

\[ \boxed{21.722} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{21.722} \] \] \]

First, we calculate \(\Delta \psi\):

\[
\Delta \psi = A_1 (\sin \alpha_1)^2 + B_1 (\cos \alpha_1)^2

Since \((\sin \alpha_1)^2 + (\cos \alpha_1)^2 = 1\), we can rewrite \(\Delta \psi\) as:

\[

Next, we calculate \(\Delta \epsilon\):

\[
\Delta \epsilon = C_1 (\sin \alpha_1 \cdot \cos \alpha_1) + D_1 (\cos \alpha_1 \cdot \sin \alpha_1) = (C_1 + D_1) (\sin \alpha_1 \cdot \cos \alpha_1)

Substituting the values of \(C_1\) and \(D_1\):

\[
\Delta \epsilon = (-0.03449537932501712 + 0.09905712146854748) (\sin \alpha_1 \cdot \cos \alpha_1) = 0.06456174214353036 (\sin \alpha_1 \cdot \cos \alpha_1)

Again, without the value of \(\alpha_1\), we cannot simplify further. But we can still express it in terms of the coefficients:

\[
\Delta \epsilon = 0.06456174214353036 (\sin \alpha_1 \cdot \cos \alpha_1)
\]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \(\alpha_1\), we cannot determine the exact numerical values of \(\Delta \psi\) and \(\Delta \epsilon\). However, we can express them in terms of \(\alpha_1\):

\[
\Delta \psi = -0.0022787478155803786 (\sin \alpha_1)^2 + 0.043000668903179495 (\cos \alpha_1)^2

Substituting these values into the equation for \(\sin \beta\):

\[

Thus,

\[

Next, we calculate \(\cos \beta\):

\[
\cos \beta \approx \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.1232^2} \approx \sqrt{0.9848} \approx 0.9924

Thus,

\[
\cos \lambda \approx \frac{0.9503}{0.9924} \approx 0.9576

Next, we calculate \(\sin \lambda \cos \beta\):

\[
\sin \lambda \cos \beta = \sin 13.26^\circ \sin 24.24^\circ + \cos 13.26^\circ \cos 24.24^\circ \sin 12.84^\circ \approx 0.2299 \times 0.4108 + 0.9732 \times 0.9117 \times 0.2203 \approx 0.0944 + 0.1966 \approx 0.2910

θ = θ₀ + 2 × ( (r · n̂) / D )","Step 1: Confirm the given values:
θ₀ = 242.93°
D = 61.13 m
r = [6.68, -9.27, -9.52] m
n̂ = [-0.5720, -0.8200, -0.0194]

Step 2: Compute the dot product r · n̂:
= 6.68×-0.5720 + -9.27×-0.8200 + -9.52×-0.0194
= 3.9652

Step 3: Compute the angle offset:
Δθ = 2 × (3.9652 / 61.13) = 0.129730 rad
= 7.4330°

Step 4: Compute the total angle:
θ = 242.93 + 7.4330 = 250.3630°

final_answer: θ = 250.3630°",θ = 250.3630°,"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Compute the dot product \( r \cdot \hat{n} \).
2. Divide the dot product by the observation distance \( D \).
3. Multiply the result by 2.
4. Add this value to the reference angle \( \theta_0 \).

Let's start with the dot product \( r \cdot \hat{n} \):
\[ r \cdot \hat{n} = 6.68 \times (-0.5720) + (-9.27) \times (-0.8200) + (-9.52) \times (-0.0194) \]
\[ r \cdot \hat{n} = -3.81616 + 7.5814 + 0.184588 \]
\[ r \cdot \hat{n} = 3.949828 \]

Next, we divide the dot product by the observation distance \( D \):
\[ \frac{r \cdot \hat{n}}{D} = \frac{3.949828}{61.13} \]
\[ \frac{r \cdot \hat{n}}{D} \approx 0.06461 \]

Now, we multiply this result by 2:
\[ 2 \times \frac{r \cdot \hat{n}}{D} \approx 2 \times 0.06461 \]
\[ 2 \times \frac{r \cdot \hat{n}}{D} \approx 0.12922 \]

Finally, we add this value to the reference angle \( \theta_0 \):
\[ \theta = \theta_0 + 2 \times \frac{r \cdot \hat{n}}{D} \]
\[ \theta \approx 242.93 + 0.12922 \]
\[ \theta \approx 243.05922 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the final answer is:
\[ \theta \approx 243.06 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{243.06}

TT time = 2023-03-27 19:18:14","To solve the problem, we need to calculate the TAI and TT based on the given UTC time and the redefined time conversion rules. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - UTC time: 2023-03-27 19:17:38
   - Leap second correction, ΔAT: 10 seconds

2. **Calculate TAI:**
   The formula for TAI is:
   \[
   \text{TAI} = \text{UTC} + 2 \times \Delta \text{AT}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{TAI} = \text{2023-03-27 19:17:38} + 2 \times 10 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{TAI} = \text{2023-03-27 19:17:38} + 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Adding 20 seconds to 2023-03-27 19:17:38 gives:
   \[
   \text{TAI} = \text{2023-03-27 19:17:58}
   \]

3. **Calculate TT:**
   The formula for TT is:
   \[
   \text{TT} = \text{TAI} + 16.092 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Substituting the calculated TAI:
   \[
   \text{TT} = \text{2023-03-27 19:17:58} + 16.092 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Adding 16.092 seconds to 2023-03-27 19:17:58 gives:
   \[
   \text{TT} = \text{2023-03-27 19:18:14.092}
   \]

4. **Final answers:**
   - TAI: 2023-03-27 19:17:58
   - TT: 2023-03-27 19:18:14.092

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{2023-03-27 19:18:14.092}}
