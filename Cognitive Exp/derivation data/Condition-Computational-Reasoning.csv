The hydrogen number density is $n_H = <Replace>\,\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, and the temperature of the HII region is $T_{HII} = 8.97e+03\,\mathrm{K}$. The hydrogen recombination coefficient is $\alpha = 4.01e-19\,\mathrm{m^3\,s^{-1}}$. Assuming each ionizing photon ionizes exactly one hydrogen atom and ignoring secondary ionizing photons from recombination, derive an expression for the Stromgren radius and calculate its value in parsecs.","A Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star emits ionizing photons at a rate $Q = tan(-1.57)\,\mathrm{ph\,s^{-1}}$ and is surrounded by a static, homogeneous, pure hydrogen nebula.
