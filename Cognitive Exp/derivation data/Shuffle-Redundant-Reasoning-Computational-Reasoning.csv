### Step 2: Circular orbit velocities
The circular velocity is given by:
v = √(μ / r)

v₁ = √(3.15e+04 / 24370) = 1.137 km/s
v₂ = √(3.15e+04 / 42214) = 0.864 km/s

### Step 3: Transfer orbit parameters

aₜ = (r₁ + r₂)/2 = 33292 km

e = (r₂ − r₁)/(r₂ + r₁) = 0.2680

### Step 4: Velocities on the transfer orbit

v = √[ μ ( 2/r − 1/a ) ]

Velocity at periapsis (r₁): vₚ = 1.280 km/s

0,0.35,"A spacecraft is launched from Earth onto a lowest-energy Hohmann transfer orbit to an outer planet. Assume that both Earth and the target planet move on circular, coplanar heliocentric orbits.

Given the following data:
- Semimajor axis of Earth's orbit: 1.00 AU
- Semimajor axis of the target planet's orbit: 5.02 AU
- Solar gravitational parameter: GM☉ = 1.327e+11 km³/s²

Using the vis-viva equation, determine the spacecraft’s hyperbolic excess velocity v∞ relative to the target planet at encounter. Provide your answer in km/s.","We begin with the vis-viva equation for heliocentric motion:

    v² = GM☉ ( 2/r − 1/a )

For a Hohmann transfer from Earth to the target planet, the perihelion distance is Earth's orbital radius and the aphelion distance is the target planet’s orbital radius. The semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse is therefore:

    a = (r_E + r_P)/2 = (1.00 AU + 5.02 AU)/2
      = 3.011 AU

At the distance of the target planet, r = r_P, the spacecraft’s heliocentric speed is:

    v_sc = [ GM☉ ( 2/r_P − 1/a ) ]^{1/2}

Substituting the given values:

    v_sc = [ 1.327e+11 ( 2/5.02 − 1/3.011 ) ]^0.5
         = 93684.61 km/s

The target planet’s heliocentric orbital speed, assuming a circular orbit, is:

    v_P = ( GM☉ / r_P )^{1/2}

Substituting the numerical value:

    v_P = ( 1.327e+11 / 5.02 )^0.5
        = 162562.67 km/s

Because the planet is moving faster than the spacecraft at encounter, the hyperbolic excess speed is the difference between these velocities:

    v∞ = | v_P − v_sc |

       = | 162562.67 − 93684.61 |

- \(C\) is a lunar perturbation coefficient (degrees/day),
- \(i\) is the orbital inclination,
- \(n\) is the mean motion in revolutions per day.

Given:
  • Departure radius vector: r₁ = 0.997 AU
  • Arrival radius vector:   r₂ = 1.880 AU
  • Transfer semi-major axis: a = 2.249 AU

Assume the departure point is at periapsis of the transfer ellipse (one-tangent condition).
Use μ☉ = 1.32712440018×10¹¹ km³/s² and 1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km.

How do you convert the time-of-flight from seconds to days? Provide the time-of-flight in days.","Step 1: Convert the given distances from AU to km.
  1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km
  r₁ = (0.997)(AU) = 149,203,746.608 km
  r₂ = (1.880)(AU) = 281,309,553.784 km
  a  = (2.249)(AU) = 336,402,162.599 km

Step 2: Apply the one-tangent condition (departure at periapsis).
  For an ellipse, periapsis radius is:
    r_p = a(1 - e)
  With r_p = r₁, solve for eccentricity e:
    e = 1 - r₁/a
    e = 1 - (149,203,746.608)/(336,402,162.599) = 0.556472

Step 3: Compute the semi-latus rectum p.
  For an ellipse:
    p = a(1 - e²)
    p = (336,402,162.599)(1 - 0.556472²) = 232,231,467.979 km

Step 4: Solve for the arrival true anomaly ν₂ using the conic equation.
  Radius as a function of true anomaly is:
    r(ν) = p / (1 + e cos ν)
  Set r(ν₂) = r₂ and solve for cos ν₂:
    r₂ = p / (1 + e cos ν₂)
    1 + e cos ν₂ = p / r₂
    cos ν₂ = (p/r₂ - 1)/e
    cos ν₂ = (232,231,467.979/281,309,553.784 - 1)/0.556472 = -0.313516
  Therefore:
    ν₂ = arccos(-0.313516) = 1.889690 rad = 108.271°
  With departure at periapsis (ν₁ = 0), the change in true anomaly is:
    Δν = ν₂ - ν₁ = 108.271°

Step 5: Compute time-of-flight from periapsis (ν=0) to ν₂.
  Convert true anomaly ν₂ to eccentric anomaly E using:
    tan(ν/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) · tan(E/2)
  Rearranged:
    tan(E/2) = sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) · tan(ν/2)
    sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) = sqrt((1-0.556472)/(1+0.556472)) = 0.533814
    tan(E/2) = (0.533814)·tan(1.889690/2) = 0.738401
    E = 2·atan(tan(E/2)) = 2·atan(0.738401) = 1.272073 rad

  Compute mean anomaly M:
    M = E - e sin E
    M = 1.272073 - (0.556472)·sin(1.272073) = 0.740245 rad

  Compute mean motion n for the ellipse:
    n = sqrt(μ / a³)
    n = sqrt((1.327124400180e+11) / (336,402,162.599³)) = 5.904289564454e-08 rad/s

  Time-of-flight from periapsis (M=0) to M is:
    TOF = M / n
    TOF = 0.740245 / (5.904289564454e-08) = 12,537,412.298 s

Step 6: Convert the time-of-flight from seconds to days.
  Use the conversion factor:
    1 day = 86,400 s
  Therefore:
    TOF(days) = TOF(seconds) / 86,400
    TOF(days) = 12,537,412.298 / 86,400 = 145.11 days","TOF = 12,537,412.298 s = 145.11 days","Using a one-tangent burn transfer, calculate the change in true anomaly and the time-of-flight (TOF)

Step 4: Solve for the arrival true anomaly ν₂ using the conic equation.
  Radius as a function of true anomaly is:
    r(ν) = p / (1 + e cos ν)
  Set r(ν₂) = r₂ and solve for cos ν₂:
    r₂ = p / (1 + e cos ν₂)
    1 + e cos ν₂ = p / r₂
    cos ν₂ = (p/r₂ - 1)/e
    cos ν₂ = (232,231,467.979/281,309,553.784 - 1)/0.556472 = -0.313516
  Therefore:
    ν₂ = arccos(-0.313516) = 1.889690 rad = 108.271°
  With departure at periapsis (ν₁ = 0), the change in true anomaly is:

  Convert true anomaly ν₂ to eccentric anomaly E using:
    tan(ν/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e)) · tan(E/2)
  Rearranged:
    tan(E/2) = sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) · tan(ν/2)
    sqrt((1-e)/(1+e)) = sqrt((1-0.556472)/(1+0.556472)) = 0.533814

0,0.35,"A spacecraft is assumed to travel on a heliocentric elliptical transfer orbit.

- The semi-major axis of the orbit is a = 1.928 AU.
- The orbital eccentricity is e = 0.299.
- At the time of planetary intercept, the spacecraft's heliocentric distance is r = 1.930 AU.

Assume the spacecraft departs from perihelion, so the initial eccentric anomaly is E₁ = 0.

How is the change in eccentric anomaly ΔE computed? Provide the final numerical value in radians.","### Step-by-step Solution

For an elliptical orbit, the radial distance r is related to the eccentric anomaly E by:

\[
r = a (1 - e \cos E)
\]

Since the spacecraft departs from perihelion, the initial eccentric anomaly is:

\[
E_1 = 0
\]

Rearranging the radial distance equation to solve for E at intercept:

\[
\cos E_2 = \frac{1 - r/a}{e}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\cos E_2 = \frac{1 - 1.930/1.928}{0.299} = -0.004590
\]

Taking the inverse cosine:

\[
E_2 = \arccos(-0.004590) = 1.575386 \text{ radians}
\]

Because E₁ = 0, the change in eccentric anomaly is:

Explain how the semi-major axis a of the heliocentric transfer orbit is refined so that the computed time of flight matches the planned value. Also state the time of flight in days.","### Step 1: Convert the planned time of flight to seconds
The planned time of flight is given in days. Convert it to seconds using:

\[
t_{\text{target}} = (\text{days}) \times 86400
\]

\[
t_{\text{target}} = 185.4 \times 86400 = 16,018,206\ \text{s}
\]

---
### Step 2: Initial estimate of the semi-major axis
An initial guess for the semi-major axis \( a_0 \) is usually obtained from a Hohmann-like approximation using the magnitudes of the position vectors:

\[
a_0 \approx \frac{r_E + r_M}{2}
\]

where \( r_E = |\mathbf{r}_E| \) and \( r_M = |\mathbf{r}_M| \).

---
### Step 3: Compute the time of flight for the guessed orbit
For an elliptical heliocentric orbit, the time of flight is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler’s third law:

\[
t = \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}
\]

Using the current estimate of \( a \), a corresponding time of flight \( t_{\text{calc}} \) is computed.

---
### Step 4: Iterative refinement of the semi-major axis
If \( t_{\text{calc}} \neq t_{\text{target}} \), the semi-major axis is adjusted:

- If \( t_{\text{calc}} < t_{\text{target}} \), increase \( a \)
- If \( t_{\text{calc}} > t_{\text{target}} \), decrease \( a \)

This process is repeated (for example, using a Newton–Raphson or bisection method) until the difference between the calculated and target times of flight is within an acceptable tolerance.

---
### Step 5: Convergence
After several iterations, the semi-major axis converges to a value that produces a time of flight equal to the planned mission duration.
","The semi-major axis is refined iteratively until the computed time of flight matches the mission requirement. The final time of flight is:

\[\nz = \left[\frac{a_e(1 - e^2)}{\sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 L}} + H\right]\sin L\n\]\n\nwhere:
- $a_e = 6378.137$ km is the Earth's equatorial radius,
- $e = 0.08182$ is the Earth's eccentricity,
- $L = 33.73^\circ$ is the geodetic latitude,
- $H = 2.457$ km is the altitude above sea level.

#### 1. Convert latitude to radians

\[\nL = 33.73^\circ = 0.588697 	ext{ rad}
\]\n\n#### 2. Compute the prime vertical radius of curvature

\[\n\frac{a_e(1 - e^2)}{\sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2 L}}\n\]\n\nSubstituting the values:

\[\n= \frac{6378.137(1 - 0.08182^2)}{\sqrt{1 - 0.08182^2 \sin^2(33.73^\circ)}}
\]\n\nThis evaluates to approximately **6341.987 km**.

#### 3. Compute the z-component

\[\nz = (N + H)\sin L\n\]\n\nSubstituting numerical values:

\[\nz = (6341.987 + 2.457)\sin(33.73^\circ)

Assuming a Hohmann transfer between the two orbits and using Earth's gravitational parameter, determine the time of flight required for the transfer.

For a Hohmann transfer, the time of flight (TOF) is equal to half the period of the transfer ellipse:

\\[\nTOF = \pi \sqrt{\frac{a_t^3}{\mu}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:
- $a_t$ is the semi-major axis of the transfer orbit,
- $\mu$ is Earth's gravitational parameter.

With p in arcseconds, d(pc) = 1/p.
p = 93 mas = 0.093 arcsec
d = 1/0.093 = 10.8 pc
Convert to meters: d = (10.8)(3.086×10^16 m) = 3.318e+17 m

Step 2: Convert the CCD spot size into an angular radius (small-angle approximation).
A linear radius x on the focal plane corresponds to angle θ ≈ x/f.
f = 688 mm = 6.881e-01 m
D = 0.949 µm = 9.487e-07 m, so x = D/2 = 4.743e-07 m
θ = x/f = (4.743e-07)/(6.881e-01) = 6.893e-07 rad
Then the stellar radius is R = θ d:

Step 3: Compute the Sun’s apparent magnitude from the distance modulus at 1 AU.

m_⊙ = M_⊙ + 5 log10(a_pc) − 5 = 4.83 + 5 log10(4.848e-06) − 5 = -26.74

Step 4: Use Pogson’s relation to get the flux ratio:
m − m_⊙ = −2.5 log10(F/F_⊙)  ⇒  F/F_⊙ = 10^{0.4(m_⊙ − m)}
F/F_⊙ = 10^[0.4(-26.74 − 7.24)] = 2.557e-14

Assuming uniform angular motion, how long will it take until the two planets again share the same ecliptic longitude?","Step 1: Geometry of the orbit
For a planet with orbital inclination i and angular velocity ω, the relation between its ecliptic longitude λ and time t is obtained from spherical geometry:

    tan λ = cos i · tan(ω t)

Step 2: Condition for equal ecliptic longitude
The planets share the same ecliptic longitude again when:

    cos i₁ · tan(ω₁ t) = cos i₂ · tan(ω₂ t)

Step 3: Use the ratio of angular velocities
Since ω = 2π / T, the angular velocities satisfy:

    ω₂ / ω₁ = T₁ / T₂ = 2.00

For the present case, this leads to an algebraic equation for tan(ω₁ t).
Following the standard textbook manipulation:

    tan(ω₁ t) = √(1 − 2 cos i₂ / cos i₁)

Step 4: Solve for the time
Thus,

    t = (T₁ / 2π) · arctan[ √(1 − 2 cos i₂ / cos i₁) ]

$$
2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_\odot}\right)

\implies
L=L_\odot\left(\frac{r}{10\:\mathrm{pc}}\right)^2\cdot 10^{(M_\odot-m)/2.5}.
$$

At the antisolar point (directly opposite the Sun), the dust is approximately $r=|R-1|$ AU from Earth, so

$$

= \frac{0.81}{206265}\ \text{pc}.
$$

Get:

$$
L \approx 2.04\times 10^{11}\ \text{W}.
$$

Step2: Now, let's calculate how much luminosity one particle reflects. To do this, we calculate the solar flux at the dust orbit
and multiply by the particle's cross-sectional area and its albedo.

The solar flux at heliocentric distance $R$ is

$$
F = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}.
$$

A particle of radius $a$ has cross-section $A=\pi a^2$, so the reflected power (in this simplified model) is

$$
L_p = F\,A\,\alpha = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi R^2}\cdot (\pi a^2)\cdot \alpha.
$$

With $R=1.81\,\text{AU}$, $a=0\,\text{cm}$, and $\alpha=0.38$:

Get:

$$
L_p \approx 4.98\times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}.

Step3: Finally, divide the total luminosity per arcsec$^2$ by the reflected luminosity per particle:

$$

The satellite initially moves in a circular orbit. When its velocity is reduced to zero, it begins to fall radially toward the planet. Because the initial orbital radius is much larger than the planet’s physical radius, the time to reach the surface is approximately the same as the time to reach the planet’s center.

Assuming the planet is much less massive than the star (m_p ≪ M_s), we approximate:

Convert the period to seconds:
T = 3.29 days × 86400 s/day = 2.844e+05 s

The semimajor axes of the orbits of Earth and Mars are 1.469e+08 km and 2.297e+08 km, respectively.","Step 1: For a Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars, the transfer ellipse has semimajor axis
a_t = (a_E + a_M)/2
a_t = ( 1.469e+08 + 2.297e+08 )/2 = 1.883e+08 km

Step 2: The heliocentric speed on the transfer orbit at Earth's distance (vis-viva equation) is
v1 = sqrt( μ_sun (2/r_E − 1/a_t) )
v1 = sqrt( 1.327e+11 (2/1.469e+08 − 1/1.883e+08) ) = 33.189 km/s

Step 3: Earth's heliocentric orbital speed is
v_E = sqrt( μ_sun / r_E )
v_E = sqrt( 1.327e+11 / 1.469e+08 ) = 30.052 km/s

Therefore, the hyperbolic excess speed relative to Earth is
v_∞ = v1 − v_E
v_∞ = 33.189 − 30.052 = 3.136 km/s

Step 4: The spacecraft must depart Earth's gravity well from its LEO radius r_p = R_E + h.
The circular orbital speed is
v_orb = sqrt( μ_E / r_p )
r_p = 6371 + 390 = 6761 km
v_orb = sqrt( 3.986e+05 / 6761 ) = 7.679 km/s

The escape speed at the same radius is
v_esc = sqrt(2) v_orb
v_esc = sqrt(2)(7.679) = 10.859 km/s

Step 5: Relate hyperbolic excess speed to perigee speed on the departure hyperbola:
v_p^2 = v_esc^2 + v_∞^2
v_p = sqrt( (10.859)^2 + (3.136)^2 ) = 11.303 km/s

Thus the required impulsive burn from LEO is
Δv = v_p − v_orb

If quantum effects are considered, black holes emit Hawking radiation. Assume that this radiation consists of photons with a blackbody spectrum that peaks at a wavelength $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\mathrm{SC}}$.

It is known that the Schwarzschild radius of a solar-mass black hole is $R_{\mathrm{SC,\odot}} = 2.952\,\mathrm{km}$.

1) Derive an expression for the black hole temperature $T_\mathrm{bh}$ in terms of its mass $M_\mathrm{bh}$ and physical constants.
2) Calculate $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ and $T_\mathrm{bh}$ for a black hole of mass 19.7061 $M_\odot$.","Solution:

Step 1: Use Wien’s displacement law.
The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is related to temperature by
\[
\lambda_{\rm peak} = \frac{b}{T}, \qquad b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m\,K}.
\]
Given $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, the temperature is
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b}{16 R_{\rm SC}}.
\]

Step 2: Express the Schwarzschild radius in terms of mass.
For a black hole,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = \frac{2 G M_{\rm bh}}{c^2}.
\]
Substituting into the temperature expression gives
\[
T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{2(16) G M_{\rm bh}}.
\]
For $\lambda_\mathrm{bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC}$, this becomes
\[
\boxed{T_{\rm bh} = \frac{b c^2}{32 G M_{\rm bh}}}.
\]

Step 3: Compute the Schwarzschild radius for the given mass.
Since $R_{\rm SC}$ scales linearly with mass,
\[
R_{\rm SC} = (2.952\,\mathrm{km}) \times (19.7061) = 58.172\,\mathrm{km}.
\]

Step 4: Compute the black hole temperature.
Convert the radius to meters:
\[

\]
Then the peak wavelength is
\[
\lambda_{\rm bb} \approx 16 R_{\rm SC} = 9.308e+05\,\mathrm{m}.

Assuming the collision is central and perfectly inelastic, and neglecting external gravitational influences, calculate the expected change in the orbital period of the moon (in minutes).","Step 1: Determine the initial orbital radius and velocity.
Because the primary asteroid is much more massive than the moon, we treat the moon as orbiting a fixed central mass. From Kepler’s third law:

Let $A$ be the surface area of one side of the flat Earth. If the Sun makes an angle $\theta$ with the Earth's axis, the absorbed solar power is
$$P_{\rm in} = S_\odot A \cos\theta.$$

The Earth radiates as a blackbody from both sides, so the emitted power is

$p=\frac{E}{c}$

Where $p$ corresponds to the momentum, $E$ is the energy of the photon, and $c$ is the speed of light.

Since the momentum is conserved after the collision of the photons with the sail, it is possible to write the following expression for the radiation pressure on the sail.

Get:

$P_r=(1+\eta)\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}$

Where $P_r$ is the radiation pressure and $F_{\odot}$ is the Solar flux. Note that the $1+\eta$ term comes from the fact that a fraction $\eta$ of the photons being reflected causes a momentum in the opposite direction to their motion before the collision with the sail.

Step2: In order to preserve the momentum, the sail needs to end up with $1+\eta$ times the initial momentum to account for the reflected photons.

Taking into account both the radiation pressure and the gravity, it is possible to find an expression for the acceleration $a$ as a function of the distance $r$ to the Sun.

Get:

$ma=(1+\eta)A\frac{F_{\odot}}{c}-\frac{GM_{\odot}m}{r^{2}}$

Step4: Integrating to find the velocity of the sail.

$\frac{v^2}{2}=k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)$

$v=\sqrt{2k\left(\frac{1}{R_{\odot}}-\frac{1}{r}\right)}$

$v\approx \sqrt{\frac{2k}{R_{\odot}}}=5.4\cdot 10^5\ \mathrm{m/s}$

**Detailed Steps**.

The solution to this question involves some domain knowledge, parts of which were given in the problem's statement, some approximations sourced by the domain knowledge, and some mathematical calculations. The domain knowledge is very basic and should be known to anyone in the field. Approximations are intuitive and also, mostly, inspired by the domain knowledge. Following Polya, we can organize it as follows:

Step2:
**Understand the problem.**

The number density of halos $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as:

$\begin{equation}N_h = \int_{V} n_h(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}.\end{equation}$


The overdensity is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{n_h(\mathbf{x})-\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}{\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})\rangle}.\end{equation}$

Linear bias is defined in terms of Fourier-transformed quantities:

$\begin{equation}\delta_h(\mathbf{k}) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k}).\end{equation}$

This is an approximation that holds on sufficiently large scales (small $k$). $\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$ and $\delta_h(\mathbf{k})$ are Gaussian random fields with zero mean and their variance depends only on the magnitude of the wave-vector $k=|\mathbf{k}|$:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{mm}(k)),\ \delta_h \sim \mathcal{N}(0,P_{hh}(k)).\end{equation}$

The quantity $P(k)$ is called the power spectrum and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{k})\delta(\mathbf{k'})\rangle = (2\pi)^3\delta^D(\mathbf{k+k'})P(k).\end{equation}$

It immediately follows that:

$\begin{equation}P_{hh}(k) = b^2P_{mm}(k).\end{equation}$

We are given the expression in real space. In real space, the quantity $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$ is also a Gaussian random field:

$\begin{equation}\delta_m(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_m),\ \delta_h(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \xi_h).\end{equation}$

Quantity $\xi$ is called a two-point (real-space) correlation function and is defined as:

$\begin{equation}\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x'})\rangle = \xi(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|).\end{equation}$

This quantity is sufficiently small when $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|\gg1$. We are asked to find what is the expression for $b$ in the equation $\delta_h(k) = b\delta_m(\mathbf{k})$, given the real-space expression for the number density $n_h(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of real-space sample of $\delta_m(\mathbf{x})$.

Step3:
**Devise a plan.**

The key point to solve this problem should be that real-space correlation function for halos $\xi_h$ should also be equal to $b^2\xi_m$. We want to calculate that correlation function. It should be expressed in terms of $\langle n(\mathbf{x})\rangle$ and $\langle n_h(\mathbf{x})n_h(\mathbf{x'})\rangle$. We expect to be able to calculate these expectations since they are the expectations of functions of the Gaussian random variables. We are given the pixel variance $\sigma$. How does it connect to the other quantities we know? In principle, that's also the part of domain knowledge but it also can be deducted from the definitions already given. A discretized version of the correlation function is:

$\begin{equation}\xi_{ij} = \langle\delta_{\mathbf{x_i}}\delta_{\mathbf{x_j}}\rangle.\end{equation}$

When $i=j$, it becomes the pixel variance $\sigma$. \textit{Aside, we could have given instead of $\sigma$, the quantity $P_{mm}(k)$, that is a common description of a cosmological dark-matter field. In that case, from the definitions of $\xi(r)$ and $P_{mm}(k)$, we could have deduced that $\sigma = \frac{1}{V}\sum_{k}P_{mm}(k)$}. Then we pick the ensemble of all the pixels at given fixed large distance $r=|\mathbf{x_i}-\mathbf{x_j}|$. The key is to recognize that it is fully described by a correlated bivariate Gaussian distribution.

$\begin{equation}(\delta^m_{i},\delta^m_{j}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma) \end{equation}$

with a covariance

$\begin{equation}\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2 & \xi^m_r  \\ \xi^m_r & \sigma^2 \end{pmatrix}.\end{equation}$

In general, the integrals from the expectation values are cumbersome, but we should expect some simplifications from the fact that $\xi$ is small and we can Taylor-expand the pdf.

Step4:
**Carry out the plan.**

It's more convenient to define $\hat{\delta}_{i} = \delta^m_i/\sigma$ and $\hat{\xi} = \xi^m_r/\sigma^2$, and $\phi_2$ - a correlated bivariate Gaussian pdf - then

$\begin{equation}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2(1-\hat{\xi}^2)}[\hat{\delta}^2_{i}+\hat{\delta}^2_{j}-2\hat{\xi}\hat{\delta}_{i}\hat{\delta}_{j}]}}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\hat{\xi}^2}} \equiv \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}).\end{equation}$

We note that

$\begin{equation}\xi^{n}_r = \frac{\langle n_in_j\rangle}{\langle n \rangle^2}-1.\end{equation}$

The quantity $\langle n\rangle$ is the actual mean number density:

$\begin{equation}\bar{n}^{'} = \langle n \rangle = \langle n_i \rangle = \int n^{loc}(\delta_i,b,\bar{n}) \phi_2(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi}) d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j} = \int n^{loc}_i \phi_1(\hat{\delta_i})d\hat{\delta_i}.\end{equation}$

Here, $\phi_1$ - is a standard normal pdf. It is expected that it's not dependent on the correlation $\hat{\xi}$, but only on $b$ and $\sigma$, just as the marginal of 2D correlated Gaussian distribution is 1D Gaussian that's not dependent on the cross-correlation. To the linear order in $\hat{\xi}$,

$\begin{equation}\phi_2(x,y|\hat{\xi}) \approx \phi_1(x)\phi_1(y)(1+\hat{\xi}xy).\end{equation}$

So that the two-point function neatly factorizes:

$$\begin{aligned}&\langle n_{i}n_{j}\rangle=\int n^{loc}(\delta_{i},b,\bar{n})n^{loc}(\delta_{j},b,\bar{n})\phi_{2}(\hat{\delta}_{i},\hat{\delta}_{j}|\hat{\xi})d\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\approx\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})d\hat{\delta}_{j}+\hat{\xi}\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{i})\hat{\delta}_{i}d\hat{\delta}_{i}\int n_{j}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta}_{j})\hat{\delta}_{j}d\hat{\delta}_{j}\\&\equiv\langle n\rangle^{2}+\hat{\xi}\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^{2}.\end{aligned}$$


Substituting the results for $\langle n\rangle$ and $\langle n_in_j\rangle$ in  the equation for $\xi^n_r$, we can read off the bias:

$\begin{equation}b^{'2} = \frac{\xi^n_r}{\sigma^2\hat{\xi}} = \frac{\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^2}{\sigma^2\langle n\rangle^2}.\end{equation}$


All that is left is to calculate the expectations. One can evaluate for $b\geq0$


$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta_{i}})d\hat{\delta_{i}}=\int\bar{n}\max(0,1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\int_{-\frac{1}{b\sigma}}^{+\infty}(1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)+b\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

For $b<0$ it's, however, 

$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\bar{n}\int_{-\infty}^{+\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}}(1-|b|\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

So we conclude that the latter expression is valid for all $b$. Similarly, one can show that

$\begin{equation}\langle n\hat{\delta }\rangle = \bar{n}\int\max(0,1+b\sigma x)x\phi_1(x)dx = \bar{n}b\sigma \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\end{equation}$

where $\Phi_1(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x\phi_1(x)dx$ - normal cdf. Finally, one can get

$\begin{equation}\boxed{b^{'} = \frac{b \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}{\Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)}}.\end{equation}$

Note: We also accept solutions as correct if they omit the $|~|$ around the bias, since halo bias is usually positive.

$\begin{equation}
\boxed{

To the linear order in $\hat{\xi}$,

$\begin{equation}\phi_2(x,y|\hat{\xi}) \approx \phi_1(x)\phi_1(y)(1+\hat{\xi}xy).\end{equation}$

Substituting the results for $\langle n\rangle$ and $\langle n_in_j\rangle$ in  the equation for $\xi^n_r$, we can read off the bias:

$\begin{equation}b^{'2} = \frac{\xi^n_r}{\sigma^2\hat{\xi}} = \frac{\langle n\hat{\delta}\rangle^2}{\sigma^2\langle n\rangle^2}.\end{equation}$


All that is left is to calculate the expectations. One can evaluate for $b\geq0$


$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\int n_{i}^{loc}\phi_{1}(\hat{\delta_{i}})d\hat{\delta_{i}}=\int\bar{n}\max(0,1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\int_{-\frac{1}{b\sigma}}^{+\infty}(1+b\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)+b\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{b\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

For $b<0$ it's, however, 

$$\begin{aligned}\langle n\rangle&=\bar{n}\int_{-\infty}^{+\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}}(1-|b|\sigma x)\phi_{1}(x)dx\\&=\bar{n}\left[\Phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)+|b|\sigma\phi_{1}\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\right].\end{aligned}$$

So we conclude that the latter expression is valid for all $b$. Similarly, one can show that

$\begin{equation}\langle n\hat{\delta }\rangle = \bar{n}\int\max(0,1+b\sigma x)x\phi_1(x)dx = \bar{n}b\sigma \Phi_1\left(\frac{1}{|b|\sigma}\right)\end{equation}$

 & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'y_{1}'|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\

 & =\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step9: where we used the completeness of the basis, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:x1}) and (\ref{eq:x2}), and the usual delta function normalization of the position basis. This and a similar relation for $\hat{y}_{2}$ imply

$\begin{equation}
\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}=\left|\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}$

Step10: This means

$\begin{equation}
\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\right)=\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\rangle=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].
\end{equation}$

Step11: The partial trace is defined through the following contraction of $(2,2)$ tensor to a $(1,1)$ tensor: 

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw\left(|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}''|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle w|\right)\left(|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\right)\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\right)\\
 & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\int dw|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}''-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step12: Integrate over $w$, we find

\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\exp\left[-\frac{m}{4}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[\frac{(\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}-\frac{\sqrt{\omega_{1}}}{\sqrt{\omega_{2}}})^{2}(x_{1}'+x_{1}'')^{2}}{8\frac{1}{m}(\frac{1}{\omega_{1}}+\frac{1}{\omega_{2}})}\right]\\
 & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}2x_{1}'x_{1}''-m\left[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}\right]\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}\right].\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step13: Next, to identify the matrix, use

$\begin{equation}
\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}2x_{1}'x_{1}''-m\left[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}\right]\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}=-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left[\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)-2\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right]
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\gamma\equiv8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\equiv\frac{m\gamma}{8(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
b=2\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}
\end{equation}$

Step14: to write

\begin{align}
\hat{\rho} & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}} \times \nonumber\\
 & \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\left(\left[x_{1}'\right]^{2}+\left[x_{1}''\right]^{2}\right)\right]\exp\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}x_{1}'x_{1}''\right).
\end{align}

Step15: Change basis to energy with a new effective frequency

$\begin{equation}
b_{3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{3}}}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}=\sum_{nv}|v\rangle\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle\langle n|
\end{equation}$

\begin{align}
\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle & =\int dx_{1}''\int dx_{1}'\langle v|x_{1}''\rangle_{x_{1}}\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\times\nonumber \\

\end{align}

Step16: where

$\begin{equation}
\langle x_{1}'|n\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!b_{3}\sqrt{\pi}2^{n}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{3}^{2}}}H_{n}\left(\frac{x_{1}'}{b_{3}}\right)
\end{equation}$

are the well known oscillator wave functions and $b_{3}$ still has to be chosen. One can show by carrying out the integrals that the
matrix is diagonalized if 

\begin{align*}
b_{3} & =\frac{b}{\left(1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}\omega_{1}^{1/4}\omega_{2}^{1/4}}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step17: This gives $\langle v|\hat{\rho}|n\rangle=\lambda_{n}\delta_{vn}$ where

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\sqrt{m\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right]}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}m_{11}\left(\frac{b^{2}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}}{1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left[\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right]^{2}}}\right)^{n-1}\\

\end{align*}

Step18: where we used

\begin{align*}
m_{11} & =\frac{b^{3}\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\sqrt{2\pi}}{\left(1+\sqrt{1-b^{4}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\gamma b^{2}}\right)^{2}}\right)^{3/2}}\\
 & =\frac{m(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}\sqrt{2\pi}}{4(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2})\left(\frac{1}{b^{2}}+\frac{1}{b_{3}^{2}}\right)^{3/2}}\numberthis
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{b_{3}}{b}\right)^{2} & =\frac{1}{m\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{1}{4\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{m[8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}]}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}}\frac{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step19: Simplify:

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{n} & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\sqrt{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+4\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}}\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{8\omega_{1}\omega_{2}+(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}+\omega_{1}^{1/2}\omega_{2}^{1/2}4\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right)}\right)^{n}\\
 & =\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{n}.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step20: Since we want to evaluate

$\begin{equation}
-\mathrm{Tr}\left[\hat{\rho}\ln\hat{\rho}\right]=-\partial_{n}\ln\mathrm{tr}\hat{\rho}^{n}|_{n=1}
\end{equation}$

Step21: we compute

\begin{align*}
\ln\mathrm{tr}\rho^{n} & =\ln\left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}^{n}\right)\\
 & =\ln\left(\sum_{j}\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{j}\right]^{n}\right)\\
 & =n\ln\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right]+\ln\left(\sum_{j}\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{nj}\right)\\
 & =n\ln\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right]-\ln\left(1-\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]^{n}\right).\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step22: Hence, we arrive at

\begin{align*}
S & =-\left\{ \ln\left[\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right]-\frac{\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]\ln\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]}{\left(1-\left[\frac{(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right]\right)}\right\} \\
 & =\boxed{-\ln\left(\frac{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{4\sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{2}}\right)\ln\left(\frac{(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1})^{2}}{\left(\sqrt{\omega_{1}}+\sqrt{\omega_{2}}\right)^{4}}\right)}\numberthis

$\begin{equation}

 & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}\omega_{1}^{1/4}\omega_{2}^{1/4}}.\numberthis
\end{align*}","Step1: Diagonalize the original Hamiltonian

\begin{align}
H & =(x_{1}\quad x_{2}\quad p_{1}\quad p_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k+g}{2} & -\frac{g}{2}\\
-\frac{g}{2} & \frac{k+g}{2}\\
 &  & \frac{1}{2m}\\
 &  &  & \frac{1}{2m}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
p_{1}\\
p_{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}

Step2: One easily finds

$\begin{equation}
x_{1}=\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x1}
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
x_{2}=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\label{eq:x2}
\end{equation}$

Step3: diagonalizes the Hamiltonian such that in the $(y_{1},y_{2},q_{1}\equiv m\dot{y}_{1},q_{2}\equiv m\dot{y}_{2})$ basis, it is

\begin{align}
H & =(y_{1}\quad y_{2}\quad q_{1}\quad q_{2})\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{k}{2} & 0\\
0 & \frac{k}{2}+g\\
 &  & \frac{1}{2m}\\
 &  &  & \frac{1}{2m}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
q_{1}\\
q_{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}

Step4: The ladder operators are

$\begin{equation}
a_{j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}y_{j}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{m\omega_{j}}}q_{j}\right)
\end{equation}$

$\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\omega_{2}^{2}=\frac{k+2g}{m}
\end{equation}$

Step5: which allows one to rewrite the Hamiltonian as

$\begin{equation}
H=\sum_{j=1}^{2}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{j}\omega_{j}+\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{2}.
\end{equation}$

Step6: In this basis, we denote the ground state as

$\begin{equation}
a_{1}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=0=a_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}.
\end{equation}$

Step7: Hence we have found $|\Omega\rangle=|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}$. We know that the wave function in the $\vec{y}$ coordinates is the product of well known simple harmonic oscillator solutions:

$\begin{equation}
\langle y'_{1},y'_{2}|00\rangle_{\vec{n}_{y}}=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{1}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(y_{2}'\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right]
\end{equation}$

where

$\begin{equation}
b_{n}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{m\omega_{n}}}
\end{equation}$

Step8: making this a convenient basis to work with. Note

\begin{align*}
\hat{y}_{1}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right) & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'\hat{y}_{1}|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\int dy_{1}'dy_{2}'y_{1}'|y_{1}'y_{2}'\rangle\langle y_{1}'y_{2}'|\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\int dx_{1}'dx_{2}'y_{1}'\left(\left|x_{1}'\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|x_{2}'\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\left(\,_{x_{1}}\langle x_{1}'|\otimes\,_{x_{2}}\langle x_{2}'|\right)\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\\
 & =\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}\right)\numberthis
\end{align*}

Step9: where we used the completeness of the basis, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:x1}) and (\ref{eq:x2}), and the usual delta function normalization of the position basis. This and a similar relation for $\hat{y}_{2}$ imply

$\begin{equation}
\left|a\right\rangle _{x_{1}}\otimes\left|b\right\rangle _{x_{2}}=\left|\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{a-b}{\sqrt{2}}\right\rangle .
\end{equation}$

Step10: This means

$\begin{equation}
\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\left(|x_{1}'\rangle_{x_{1}}\otimes|w\rangle_{x_{2}}\right)=\,_{\vec{n}_{y}}\langle00|\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\rangle=\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{1}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'+w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{1}^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(\pi b_{2}^{2}\right)^{1/4}}\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\frac{x_{1}'-w}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}}{2b_{2}^{2}}\right].

\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & = i\delta_{\eta}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi-\delta_{\eta}\bar{F}F-\bar{F}\delta_{\eta}F\\
 & = i[-i\sqrt{2}\eta\sigma^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\bar{\phi}+\cancel{\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{F}}]\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+i\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}[i\sqrt{2}\sigma^{\beta}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\beta}\phi+\sqrt{2}\eta F]\\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi-[-i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta]F-\cancel{\bar{F}[i\sqrt{2}\bar{\eta}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi]}\,.\numberthis
\end{align*}

Integrating by parts, we find (denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms)

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\eta\sigma^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\bar{\phi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}[\sqrt{2}\sigma^{\beta}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\beta}\phi-\cancel{i\sqrt{2}\eta F}]\nonumber \\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi+\cancel{i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\eta F} \,.
\end{align}

<Replace>","Integrate by parts the first two terms to eliminate the the $\sigma$ matrices using the identity $\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\sigma^{\nu}+\bar{\sigma}^{\nu}\sigma^{\mu}=2g^{\mu\nu}$:

\begin{align}
\delta_{\eta}\mathcal{L} & =\sqrt{2}\left(\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial^{\mu}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)\nonumber \\
 & +\partial_{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\phi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi
\end{align}

again denoting with equality an equivalence up to total derivative terms, and we are using the standard notation $\eta\xi\equiv\eta^{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\xi}_{\dot{\alpha}}\bar{\eta}^{\dot{\alpha}}\equiv\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}$.

To make the remainder cancel, we solve

$\begin{equation}
\sqrt{2}\eta\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\xi+\partial_{\mu}\bar{\phi}\partial^{\mu}\delta_{\eta}\phi=0
\end{equation}$

yielding

$\begin{equation}
\boxed{\delta_{\eta}\phi=-\sqrt{2}\eta\xi,\quad\left(\delta_{\eta}\phi\right)^{\dagger}=-\sqrt{2}\bar{\xi}\bar{\eta}}.\label{eq:L4-susy}
\end{equation}$"
