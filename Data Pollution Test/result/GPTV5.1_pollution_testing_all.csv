"Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) are massive, unstable, supergiant stars that can undergo episodes of very strong mass loss, due to an instability in their atmospheres. After such an event, a dense nebula is formed around the star. LBV are also very hot stars and produce a large amount of high-energy photons that are able to ionise hydrogen atoms $(E_{ph}>h\nu_{0}=13.6$ eV) creating a roughly spherical region of ionized hydrogen (HIII region).

In this problem, we consider a static, homogeneous, pure hydrogen nebula with a concentration of $n_H=10^8\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and temperature $T_HII=10^4$ K, ionized by photons from a single LBV star with a stable rate of ionizing photons $Q=10^{49}$ ph/s. Assume that each photon can ionise only one hydrogen atom. At a particular location within an HII region, the rate of photoionization is balanced by the rate of recombination per unit volume. This sets the radius of the fully ionized region and this region is called the Stromgren sphere with the radius $R_S$.

"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

$V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})}+V_{\mathrm{s}}$

where, $\gamma=2\times10^{-8}\text{ km}^{-1}$, $V_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the constant speed of the solar wind, $R_{0}$ and $V_{0}$ are the distance and velocity, respectively, at time $t_{0}$, and $S$ is the sign factor. $S=1$ if $V_{0}>V_{\mathrm{s}}$; $S=-1$ if $V_{0}\leq V_{\mathrm{s}}$.

The last data point in each table (D5 and P8, respectively) corresponds to the arrival time of the respective CME at Earth. For this part, assume $V_{\mathrm{s} }= 330$ km $s^{- 1}$.

We shall evaluate if the “drag-only” model satisfactorily predicts the arrival times of these CMEs. To use this model an appropriate choice of $t_0$, and corresponding $R_0$ and $V_{0}$ needs to be made.

(C2) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D3-D4.

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time $T$, the radiation would return and be detected, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $H_0$.

Find an expression for $H_0$ as a function of $D,c$ (speed of light) and $T$. Consider that the separation $S$ between the Solar System and the mirror increases only due to the expansion of the universe From the law $S=se^{H_{0}t}$, where $s$ is the initial separation.

"In a binary neutron star system, two identical neutron stars of mass $M$ each undergo a circular orbit of radius $R$ around their center of mass. This problem explores the general relativistic effect of gravitational waves on this system, but the system can be approximated as Newtonian circular orbits which radiate energy but remain very nearly circular even though the radius is changing very slowly over time.

The total gravitational wave luminosity of the system, $L_{GW}$, can be approximated From general relativity by a single term which includes only a dimensionless constant, the physical constants $G$ and $c$, and $M$ and $R$. Furthermore, $c$ and $R$ are raised to the same power. Using the fact that the dimensionless constant from general relativistic calculations is $\frac{2}{5}$, determine the expression for $L_{GW}$.
