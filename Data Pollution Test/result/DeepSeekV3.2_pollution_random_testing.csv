"In reality, the space between the Sun and the Earth is permeated with the solar wind, which exerts a drag force on CMEs. This drag force can either decelerate or accelerate a CME, depending on the CME's velocity relative to that of the solar wind. To account for the solar wind's influence, we will use a“drag-only” model for distances $R_{\mathrm{obs}}(t)\geq R_0$, where $R_0$ is the distance beyond which the drag force becomes the dominant force affecting the CME's motion. The distance from the surface of the Sun as determined from the “drag-only” model, $R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$,and velocity, $V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)$, of a CME in this model is given by

$R_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{S}{\gamma}\ln\left[1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})\right]+V_{\mathrm{s}}(t-t_{0})+R_{0}$

$V_{\mathrm{D}}(t)=\frac{V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+S\gamma(V_{0}-V_{\mathrm{s}})(t-t_{0})}+V_{\mathrm{s}}$

We shall evaluate if the “drag-only” model satisfactorily predicts the arrival times of these CMEs. To use this model an appropriate choice of $t_0$, and corresponding $R_0$ and $V_{0}$ needs to be made.

(C1) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D1-D2 .

(C2) $t_0$ is taken as the midpoint of the interval D3-D4.

Assume the velocity remains constant in each specific interval D1-D2 and D3-D4, but may differ between the two intervals.

"In a binary system involving a compact star, where the companion star does not overflow its Roche lobe, the primary source of accretion for the compact star is the stellar wind from the companion star.

"<image>JSTL-Fig-12</image>As shown in the figure, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has released an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87 galaxy. To understand some simple features of this image, we will consider a simplified model of a nonrotating, static, spherically symmetric black hole of mass $M=6.5\times10^{9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, surrounded by a massless, thin, planar accretion disk of inner and outer radii, $a_{\mathrm{inner}}= 6R_{\mathrm{SC~and~}}a_{\mathrm{outer}}= 10R_{\mathrm{SC}}$, respectively, where $R_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is the Schwarzschild radius.

We assume that the accretion disk is the only source of light to be considered. Every point on the disk emits light in all directions. This light travels under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole. The path of the light rays is governed by two equations given below (which are similar to those of an object around the Sun): $\frac{1}{2}v_{\mathrm{r}}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^{2}r}\right)=E\quad;\quad v_{\phi}=r\:\omega=\frac{L}{r}$

"A bored cosmologist comes up with a thought experiment to determine the Hubble constant $(H_{0})$ for his model of a Steady-State-Universe. In this experiment, a large, fully reflecting flat mirror- carrying several gyroscopes that would maintain its spatial orientation in the same plane- would be placed at a distance $D$ from the Solar System in a region without gravitational influences. From the Earth, a laser beam would be directed towards that region for a long period of time. After a time $T$, the radiation would return and be detected, allowing the determination of the fixed constant $H_0$.

Find an expression for $H_0$ as a function of $D,c$ (speed of light) and $T$.
